Love ain't for the faint of heart
Start training, this game is hard
And arduous, you're gonna play in the dark, like when it rains in the park
You're hardly conscious of the stains and scars, enabling your partly clouded logic
To pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates
Now, you're working yourself out the same as when you strain' with a nautilus
And you're willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence
If nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense
Then, do you really regret when you've shredded your promises?
Now, I've tested the waters, kid. Sipped it; rippled the pond a bit
Visits have been abolished, and this shit's killing my confidence
Is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment?
If you miss chicks when they're around, the phrase "Let's quit" isn't an option
You best fix whatever's wrong and just move on and get on with it
Cause, You'll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it
It's sad, but proud or not, most your standards go down a notch
When loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high
Cause, It isn't really my time, is it? Shit, I just found the watch
But hearing the bell toll for me twice a day, has me fearing my grandfather clock
And I can't die without trying, my hands tied in knots
Knowing that I'll never learn to brave the waves if I stand by the docks
Love is hampered by thought, if you can handle the prospect of
Death - it's as massive a shock
And to intellects, it's a fuckin' smack in the crotch
It's a cancer that rots your soul, tosses demons off of the road
Just use caution and know, that, love ain't nothing but a loss of control
Off then, we go

Traces of love, long ago
That didn't work out
Traces of love, long ago
That didn't work out

Love'll have you nervous, doing stupid shit on purpose
Brain out of service, words slurred when you blurt shit
Studderin', utterin' non-sensical shit in your verses
Feeling like a shirtless four-breasted woman in a circus
Furthurly trying to gap an unfillable void
Because of parents never transfering that unbillical joy
So girls create a false world of filling on boys
Exploited, guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys
But when you have it, there's nothing like it, you get excited
Seeking those who provide it, on phones talking to psychics
Some fear it, spend their entire lives trying to fight it
Living in a confusing Hayes, like they're grooving to Isaac
It ain't the end of the rainbow with a treasure chest and a map
It ain't easily learnable with definitions in tact
It can ride your train of thought and demolition your tracks
Hittin' and bullwhippin you, leavin' them slits in your back
But I've been a lucky one, loving parents, loving friends
But I still spend alot of my life loving sin
But I ain't a genius on it, I can only pretend
Cause over all it's an emotion I cannot comprehend
It's love


Love ain't the basis for action
In a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction
Where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion
Hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction
And the past isn't felt as a match made in hell
But rather its held as a latter day meld
Of common mistakes and nice intentions
But when false love retention is simply vice invention
It's only right to mention the fights you get in
Nightly visions of these Tina and Ike revisions
So what's love really got to do with it?
From prude women to stool pidgeons in soup kitchens
The truth isn't as eloquent so be intelligent
Getting caught out of your element just for the hell of it's irrelevant
And that word'll fit like a glove if you don't get right
Now live your life for the love or stop
"So fuck the commercial tracks you be doin'"
"A brother got to eat"
"Yeah? Why don't you rap for food then?"

The music makes me high
Even though I stay away from canibus like Wyclef
(Deacon and Kno fry sets)
Similar to Christ (we got divine reps, so tell me)
If you know your gwan die (why step?)
Show no mercy (when bruising crews)
You get hit with more bricks than New Jerus
(Riddles confusing fools) like Confucian rules
(Cause most cats are more squared than Rubik's Cubes)
We spit raps that are totally murderous
(The rhymes are like an anaconda serpent clutch)
So check out how these herbs get touched
(Unless your broads giving us brains), nigga you ain't servin us
(Deacon and Kno), cunning lynguists with stunning English
(Our true lies bring more pumps than) Harry Renquist
(Every week) with the best speech
Roll with cats who smoke more trees than the slash and burn techniques
(Sex beats between bed sheets)
Red fleets, Pulp Fiction style, (leaving your car with red seats)
We make like fly swatters and smash pests
(Put peeps under more pressure than a Kelly Price bed set)
Keep your bodies looking like samples for the Rorscach Test
(Ink blots), so fuck around and get your team rocked
(Jugga's in the back with the beam cocked)
The plot's to have everything between L.A. and Queen's locked

Uh huh, word, uh huh word
Yo, yo, check it out
Cunninlynguists
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ya'll know how we do?
I mean... you probably don't know how we do (ha)
But you about to find out
Like what? Like what? Like what? Yo... yo
Like what? Like what? Check it. Uh huh...
Trust me, we can make the scene turn ugly
You hate me or you love me, trust me
We can make the scene turn ugly
You hate me or you love me
We can make the scene turn ugly, trust me

She sits in bed with her halo crooked
She says she's never been in love before
She takes time to define what we'll never get
We're turning into enemies with benefits
Enemies with benefits

She the girl of my dreams, also my nightmares
Cause she be jigglin' it, killin' it in her nightwear
Between mean glances that we might share
The space between us is like a lightyear
All in my phone like she AT&T
All in my Facebook pretendin she me
Cus her "Not Hot" single friends feedin her nonsense
The ghetto's trying to kill me and my chick's an accomplice
With black gloves (black gloves) black mask (black mask)
Full lips (full lips) fat ass (I like that!)
Text messaging ridiculous comments
I'd have to wash my mouth out to read you the contents
She might literally love me to death
We had a stairway to heaven til' I fell down the steps
Now I'm left with a pain in the neck
But she's my eye candy, the flavor I savor
And I'm part Vader, I think with my saber
I live in crazy town and I'm married to the mayor

She sits in bed with her halo crooked
She says she's never been in love before
She takes time to define what we'll never get
We're turning into enemies with benefits
Enemies with benefits

They call me Lex, junior
Not Rex Lewis
My ex like a six shot shooter - sex ruger
She's a sex cougar
She texts, we bang every time I sit next to her
Man, she get me hard as steel, I call her X-Ray
Coz my ex bust her neck during sex play
I get the cleanest dome, I mean it holmes
She never be at home but she never be alone
Her boyfriend is a punk, he rock a onesie
He think he fly, pullin' stunts in his undies
But she my kryptonite
I know...cryptic right?
I'm sitting back with a pipe getting ripped at night
On my window pane, the coldest rain
My enemy, Miss Lois Lane

She sits in bed with her halo crooked
She says she's never been in love before
She takes time to define what we'll never get
We're turning into enemies with benefits
Enemies with benefits

She’s a devil in a baby blue dress
Who I'm mentally redressing as an angel through sex
Who be testing my mettle - and yes, in a way, I choose the stress
And I guess that I settle cause I’m a slave to huge breasts
But it ain’t worth it
Ask me again if my mind has changed on the situation in five days
And I couldn’t say for certain
And so we stay in this deranged arrangement
Nailing ‘tween the breaks of these unwavering debates of ‘who’s the
Crazy person’?
She got them fuck-goggles on me
My judgement Impaired like I was drunk on kamakazi’s running a busted Kawasaki
Callin the love doctor cause I need a fix of this chick and it’s sickening
Wish I could quit, but my dick is mixing the signals and shit
Half of the time, I see past these disastrous signs
And half of the time, I keep asking if I’m happy to lie
If blame can be assigned, then I guess I’ll have to try this food for thought:
You can always see the shape of the pan in the pie
Savage desire in me to taste her loving
So my peace of mind will never turn into a baker’s dozen
I’m crumbling
Its about time, like that shit that light up ya wrist
Real niggas keep pleadin' the 5th
Concealed dealings in the heat of the mist
In the jungle where the simians pull semis a-plenty
In the league of the chimps
I'm so for real with bananas and clips
So I fail with the gangstas and pimps
Try'na prevail, quick money attempts
Couple hits, nigga thinkin' he rich
But I was headstrong, dead wrong perhaps
Playin' scenes in my mind when a fiend relapse
Eyes rolled back in they head relaxed
But money feeds the J's to the feet of the cool
And my feet were famished after walkin' from school
Wood heels, smokin' kill with a hooligan crew
Talkin' slick to the fiends, even robbin' a few
Niggas lucky that it's rappin' that he happen to do
Cause oh, lo and behold, it could happen to you

And the beat goes up (imperial)
You can feel it in your lows (imperial)
Imperial rock (imperial)
Imperial roll (imperial)

The politics of pushin' potent potion
One toke and I bet I got you open
Peep what I prescribe to my smokers
Give em the proper dosage
Gary boy with dreams like Michael to see the ocean
I was local til the white boy Joseph put me on different coasts
Then he left me for dead, dog
So he could push the pussy pigs Sonic The Hedgehog
The crackers wanna profit off my topics of mockin'
But yo I'm from a small town called
"Bitch when I see you, I'm in yo pockets"
Niggas rock it let it dry, trap, traffic and train hoes
Poppin' my P-95 at polices in plain clothes
The ghetto just infested with felons
So whether its the fuzz or the thugs now you under surveillance
I got a letter from the feds in the mail
That say I'm connected with some niggas that's sellin' yayo
So share some information or you'll be sharin' a cell
"Lock me up and swallow the key, throw me under the jail
Never tell, I'm a gangsta"

And the beat goes up (imperial)
You can feel it in your lows (imperial)
Imperial rock (imperial)
Imperial roll (imperial)
Uh uh uh uh, I love this bitch, uh uh uh
I love this girl, smack her on the ass, light the hash

Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E
Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E

I tried to stay all the way playa when it came to game
But got benched in a sense when it came to Jane
I can't explain the deep breaths that I take in her presence
Found recollections connect to every ounce of her essence
I love her, til she join with the air up above her
Love so strong it can't be wrong for her to share with another
Long as she touch my lips and my fingers, fuck it, we swingers
Cause it's Jane that keeps me sane
For what the world gonna bring us
Can make a blind man see and forget his doctor's appointment
For her sheer enjoyment I'll even risk unemployment
Can it be? Her first name changed to Calamity
Cause if saw by the law in my car, they grabbing me
Harrassing me, asking me 'where did she come from?'
Have me see a counselor asking questions thats plumb dumb
Trying to steal my love, so now I'm constantly taking shit
Cause now three times a week they wanna test our relationship
Shit!

Jane's all confused inside
Gone off that mary jane
She's making love to equalize
Gone off that sexy damn Jane

Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E
Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E

Yeah, spread them legs jane, I need a head change
Coochie hairs flame colored, sweet lil red thangs
She riddles every area of my brain with deep tickles
Mary, married her, carries my pain? Nope
An angel came to me one night chillin'
Said: "I won't change you, just tame who's within that Villian"
I said: "Cool, lets lay up with the stars for a minute"
Next I know we break up roaches from cigars
We done finished
Jane doing things that made me search my soul
I's a young one, she's an old freak that cuts slow
Leave her? Right now you got a hellafied no
I guess I needs her, that double edged ledge cuts throats
I love the please-her, or pleasure, whatever call it liesure
You call her a crutch, y'all hush, I call her 'Retha
Undressin her, loving the resin upon fingertips
Its over when I roll me a Fat Lady
Now sing it, bitch

Jane's all confused inside
Gone off that mary jane
She's making love to equalize
Gone off that sexy damn Jane

Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E
Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E
Damn, Damn, Damn Jane
Damn, Damn, Damn Jane
Damn, Damn, Damn Jane
I said, Damn, Damn, Damn Jane
I said, Damn, Damn, Damn Jane
Yo, first I sprinkle the verse
By addin' words, rhymes
Flippin 'em in a verse with lines
Then I'mma hit 'em disperse rhyme
Venom and then I'mma split 'em in half
Feelin' my wrath
Venturin' through parts of the South so dirty
You'll want to be given a bath
It's livin' a pathological lie to deny that I'm nice
And the truth hurts (ow)
Wearin' a blue shirt the best buy for the price
To get six guys this live and nice on the mic
So don't diss us because we're fly
Until you try what it's like
I'm liable to slice at these emcee bastards
Leaving their knees fractured
Needin' every piece of their teeth re-crafted 
So don't front cause I see past it
You're harmless like Wolverine's adamantium claws
When they're retracted 
If the scene's backlit
Or seems static, we'll wreak havoc
We'll beat batter to keep rappin'
A leech battle, a dream shatterer
For three nanoseconds 
Count your paces, one step to Tonedeff
You're Gone in Sixty Seconds like Nicholas Cage is

I'll leave you riddled with basics
There's no need for complexity
To be beside myself I need God next to me
Just kiddin'
I'm partially bullshittin'
The only time I take a loss pussy is when I lose kittens
I pitch shit past 'ya, no matter who's hittin'
I don't capsize boats
But I got crews flippin'
You catch it? The message needs analyzation
Step and your boys'll be pouring alcoholic libations
I flew sick, you knew this
I'll puzzle you, doofus
Fuck mentally
Stretch you into a physical Rubik's
It'll take more than sticker rearrangement to change it
His language is so strange, how do we contain it?
You can't just paint this up upon the canvas
Gotta get the mental picture
To begin to understand this
So anticipate defeat, delete chances
Got your heads speared on lances
Doin' burial dances 

I'm giving body language speech impediments
Each uttered threat causes confident cats to stutter-step
Cut a reputation down to sighs too raw for porn overdubs
Plate of leftovers? Eat some Eat some warmed-over thugs
A jaded wordsmith bleeding ghostwriter's pens dry
Getting on a rapper's nerves, corroding dendrites
When my thoughts connect, you ought to step away fast
Seems I gave cats ADATs the way they make tracks
Forget a scare, I'm not generous, kid
Spit Society of Nimh and indent it in lids
Indie Pennant is sick and this is just a quick reminder
If you lust to vic a cipher then I'll bus your clique to Rikers
All expenses paid, no questions asked
I'll get open in the cut and leave your flesh a gash
Can't relax, man, the last time I took a breather
I got brought up on murder charges, start the crooked fever

Hey yo, I'm not a fella to riff with
I'm so nice Mr. Rogers sued my ass
For copyright infringement
Roll with henchmen
That will switch heads
From wanna be thugs to 24/7 bitch kids
Topping my shitlist
Producting cat bastards wantin' jiggy beats
For some wack rappers
Switch my style? Who you tryin'a play?
My beats'll maraud yo' ass any time of day
Like Deuce Bigalow's chick
Whenever you do shit
People see you and holler "That's one huge bitch!"
Shit, when the LP rolls out
The Source'll be forced to make the quotables
A three-page fold-out
No doubt, I'm fed up with this wack shit
Bombin' the next kid wearin' Abercrombie and Fitch
And any jiggy rapper actin' fly on the radio's
Gettin' pulled out of rotation like a Firestone radial

Kashal Tee, the hip hop scene I phatten
Not even my winner's belt keeps my jeans from saggin'
It seems I'm braggin'
But fiends been naggin' for my next release
I apply all my expertise and make 'em extra pleased
Even get the vexed appeased, I make any brother feel this
All I do is independent, like double helix
Sellin' out? Well I hope that you're not
But how else could you afford all the soap that you drop?
You can't fuck wit me, yo, kid, look
Takin' me out ain't no small feat, you ain't Bigfoot
You should know who the heck you're facin'
Cause my reputation leaves no room for speculation
Now battle, is that you want to do?
What kind of man are you?
I bet you sit on the urinal too
Now that it's proven to you
They got a lot to tell us
NIMH got your heart skippin' beats like acapellas

I be a cryptic author
Writing poems on tombstones
Celph-Titled, the nigga you couldn't bring home 
I'm at the crib wit your bitch givin' me slow head
Split you up in more pieces than when Jesus broke bread
My clique is raw, be prepared when you meet us
Kill an unborn baby and you still couldn't de-fetus (ooh)
I don't battle with rhymes
I'd rather battle with nines
Instead of using my mind
I'd rather shatter your spine
The closest you ever came to a punch line
Was waitin' for refreshments at the prom in '89
I'm super crafty, super nasty, super raspy
Fuckin' bitches with super asscheeks
You fucking faggots don't know what raw speech is
I beat a bitch until her whole body turn to cleavage
I'm hyperactive so I drink decaffinated
My left jab is fatal, leavin' cats decapitated
Tell the Reverend Harris to pray for me, Lord
I ain't gonna live
I don't believe I'm gonna live to get much older

Lights out, so peaceful, stressless
Things used to seem so restless
Forgive me please, see I need to address this
Just haven't been this breathless since I met this
Woman who lept into my life when I was reckless
Mothered my blessed kid, but was destined to exit early
Guess you can say I've been blessed with the best gifts
Reminiscing, holding her necklace in my clenched fist
Ha, it's funny how we move in sudden directions
Dedicated my life to the public's protection
Never remarried cause love's an investment
Besides, I had a baby girl to worry about
That would struggle to blend in
Now as I think, a weightlessness is interrupting my senses
A pulsing tension carries my very frame
I rise up in ascension - WAIT!
I try to escape, but I arrive at these gates
I see a figure standing guard who invites me to pray

I tried it on
At the gates of Hell
I'm going to lay
Down, down

I walk towards the figure that's extending its hand
I move to enter past the gates yet I'm met with its grasp

Slow down son, there's things to discuss such as family
But first, let us talk about vanity

Vanity?? Man, you're sadly mistaken
Either that or your sanity's shaken
If you'd examine me patiently
You'd retract on your statement
I haven't sinned flagrantly, I've acted as faithfully
As any other single father
Who raised a baby girl graciously

Nakedly, she was at your door after her mother's death
Ignorant to racial anger and other stress
Later had a mixed baby at her sweet sixteen
How did that fit within your picnic scene?

Sometimes it's too late to fix these things
The pristine dream was over
Had to face the fact she split these genes with his sick seed
With skin the darkest pigment seen
And so I kicked and screamed
Until we found the peace that distance brings

A mixed raced queen, that was your thoughts about her mama
Up yonder went her soul, your hate growed from ponders
On life, being less trife with a white wife
So any instance of y'alls differences it was slice-slice

Oh my, it's not her race, my daughter's love flies blind
I couldn't take her making the same mistakes that crushed my life
I'm dumbstruck by these baseless allegations
I've saved too many lives of all creeds
For you to paint me as a racist
I've endangered my own safety to save babies from blazes
Black, white, latino, even asian on occasion

But why so?

How dare you question my motivation!

No need to second guess, your only aim was to be famous
Lord knows, you've left behind scorched souls
Black children left chilling, later found burnt whole
So sadly, your glory's to come urgently
Sentenced to fight fires for eternity
One two
It's Masta Ace, Cunninlynguists
We about to get into the seasons
The seasons of hip hop
How we gonna start it?

As we spring back to the past, it was all happening fast
We glorified coke and smoking crack in a glass
When b-boys danced to the latest jam
You could say this man was the greatest fan
When shoelaces were fat, and all the rapper's faces were black
And light-brown, a box with the right sound was all you needed
When it blast, they must move
You just proved you're hard like L in Krush Groove
And songs started to drop, Ain't nobody start at the top
Before Preme learned the art of the chop
This is way before SP's and MPC's
And long before CD's and MP3's
The game started to bloom and blossom
And masters ready for the cermony, like a groom in costume
Growth from the rain of the previous years
I took notes from what I heard through these devious ears
Yeah

As Summer's heatwaves ascended in it's splendid manner
Green was flooding our scene, although the skin was tanner
"Fuck The Police!!" jumpin over radio scanners
It was hot in the shade, wet paint all over the canvas
Fuck Vanilla Ice cones, we had T, Cube's Amerikka's Most
And wanted that Chronic on the Left-Coast
Talent pools were full and fresh for swimming
Backstrokin' through Dark Sides and Illmatic beginnings
Them lemonade stands would make you street platinum
It was 2 Live, Florida crews caught heat for rappin'
But free speech pollination kept bees colonizing in hives
And stung Delores Tucker right in her pride
The Tribes ocean splash was rising the tide
Strictly 4 My Niggas that were ready to die in the ride
I wish the summer's vibe could've lasted forever
To bad we had to have a change in that weather, that shit was beautiful

Lauryn Hill:
Seasons Change, mad things rearrange
Ladybug:
Play me in the winter
Play me in the summer
Play in the autumn
Any order
[Lauryn Hill:
Seasons Change, mad things rearrange]
Andre 3000:
Trees bright and green turn yellow brown, autumn caught em
See all them leaves must fall down
Verse 3: 
As the East vs. West winds blew, causing two
Legends to Fall like maple leaves from escalated beef
Assumed that the worst was over
Til these cats started wearing shiny costumes like the 31st of October
The weather's colder, but the word jacket/jack it
Is what they did to people's styles
Not what they covered they backs with
Tactics of the skill impaired
No Limit to what they'll do when the green is scarce
Some be Thanksgiving for who they know
While others get jerked for loot
Cause getting signed ain't a turkey shoot
No respect for the pilgrims who paved the way so you could rock that
Just pop crap and Plymouth Rock-Rap
Beyond gimmicks and fake plastic tits
Outkast and Raekwon dropped fall classic discs
Born to Roll, so I'm taking you back to school days of autumn
Before the bottom dropped out in 2K

By the dawn of the new millennium we saw bright chains
Winter brought along platinum causing the ice age
No more Gold, no more YO! MTV RAPS
Now we got R&B cats stealing classic rap tracks
In winter it's snowed in like the temperature's below ten
Citizens open up shows for more snowmen
Scrawny boys rock bubblegooses to pose like grown men
And you can catch freezer burn from women when they show skin
Jolly, fat, white men get paid when rap hits the shelves
And artists themselves get treated like Elves
Matter of fact, Santa's gotten so greedy when a rapper sells
You even need clearance to sample Jingle Bells
What the hell! You need cells and 2 ways for chicks to bone ya?
And so much ice on ya body that you can get pneumonia
Even at the beaches of Daytona it's gotten colder
But it's about time for the cycle to start over (echo)
How we gon' start it?
Oh yeah, it's time they come down...down

Butterfly in the sky, I can fly twice as high

He said, "Fuck sobriety, death to the worker bees"
Thirteen circles I've stepped for eternity
Burning purple, stressed on a murder spree
It's self-inflicted, don't get it twisted
These knives in my back now, Elliott Smith(yeah)
Rides in the background, melodies fit (yeah)
Mixed with the misfits, fix is the hurt
When the lips that I kiss with press to the dirt
French-kiss vixens, distant and cursed
Burned bridges occurred from scriptin' my words
Word, so I'll chisel a verse
On these lie-filled halls that I've lived in and searched
I'm still lost in a head of catacombs
Cause I build walls like I'm Edgar Allan Poe
I've killed off every damsel that I know
For castles that I keep, castles that I know


I'm having spirits in the dark, laying under moonlight
Laughing with a stranger, like I saved her from her doomed life
Pop a couple Percs, a perk of anonymity
Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
A path that I rehearse, a cycle on repeat
Life is like a lion and I'm dying at its feet
I roll another sweet, check my muted Treo
I've seen them as the plot, too busy caught up in the B-roll
My eye up to the keyhole, scared to turn the knob
And go out on my own, instead I blend in with the mob
My memory bank's the only thing I tend to rob
And every time I phone the lob, I'm out of dodge
It's hard, on the boulevard, and other clichés
The type of bullshit that I'm feeding self these days
Corrosion on my relays, one thing my mirrors chose
An imp in new clothes, exposed


I mow a dead lawn, aim for the alpha
Ten claws deck the halls of Valhalla
Not a man, a receptacle for crest-fallen matter
Never tempered or pressed into patterns
But just won't die, instead a palpitation from the plasma
Pumping disenchanting anecdotes and antiquated data at 'em
I get these headaches that climb down into my stomach
Then off into my extremities and out into the public
In a flood of shadow puppetry, something in the air
Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self-aware
It's recognizing family and alphanumeric characters
Scenery and deities with unassuming avatars
Close encounters exacerbate his condition
From classy to a bastion of classic misdirection
Tune into the Casio adventures
When the rest of me can barely form a god-damn sentence
You can only see the stars when it’s Don Cheadle black
When the chips are down who dips and who reacts?
Folding under pressure ain’t get us to where we at
When all hope’s lost you battle to get it back
In fact, dark times are when heroes shine
Without them sour grapes there would be no wine
Let your ego dine, adversity for breakfast
Zero pride, in settling for less then
Fighting tooth and nail, no matter who prevails
Instead of wishing on a star grab a comet by the tail
Your ship ain’t coming in, then you got to make a sale
Catch the wind and make it sail and hit the ground runnin’
Til ya heartbeat sound like a battle drum thumpin’
Those talking ‘bout failure ain’t talkin’ ‘bout nothin’
You may weather the storm if you don’t stop punchin’
Reach for the stars and you might just touch ‘em

Stars shine, stars shine
When you think you’ve lost your way
Making for a brighter day a brighter day
Stars shine, stars shine
Coming out to light the way
Making for a brighter day a brighter day

Our money’s funny, our change is strange
These days ain’t sunny and the sea ain’t tame
We playing games where the rules ain’t clearly defined
In this coffee black world, knee deep in the grind
Be a vine in the shade, a salmon in a stream
Try lookin’ for the stars when examining your dreams
Could go from street singers to pop figures
From block niggas to a brotha that is followin’ stock tickers
To grow in the night you gotta create light
Gotta be a gamma ray burst that erase sight
No astronomer has seen your incredible gleam
And you don’t need a telescope to detect dream
You blessed with a mind that can see through space
On dark nights, in the stars you can find your face
Just look up and marvel at all the constellations
Egyptians built pyramids from these creations

Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the light, light
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the light, light, light

Against all odds and against the grain
Sun becomes shelter in the midst of rain
In monsoon proportions them moments of importance
When victory’s in vain it’s the same the blood coursing
Of course when selfishness inside provides poison
Apply it to your life and let it sink in like ointment
Poised when them black clouds come ‘round don’t back down
Let haters be theme music playin’ in the background
"I shine in spaces where time is just a glare"
"—hold the mic like a memory"

There was a time when I couldn't find energy
The only person that was feelin' me was Mrs. Hennessy
It's like life was pinnin' me down
I used to go out on the town and get instantly clowned
You ain't gonna be a rapper, you're not a factor
You just a Kentucky boy, get yourself a tractor
Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never achieve
That's when the liquor and weed became a need
Self-esteem was lower than snorkel cities
Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel’s titties
Then as soon as I started getting some pride
My sister hydroplaned and died on I-65
In a family full of pride, house full of tears
Spent many years with a blood stream full of beers
Heart full of fears all jeers, no cheers
'Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear

"I shine in spaces where time is just a glare"
"—hold the mic like a memory"

I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
Can't grow fond of past memories
'Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy
Offended by the mental imagery
And suggest livin' in poverty was really meant for me
Paternal tendencies towards chemical dependencies
Had me thinking that all my enemies were kin to me
I can't begin to see how to control the flash backs
Progress past and my style of dress got me laughed at
Thought I was passed that but it attempts to reoccur
When I don't perceive what I feel I deserve
Being slurred by those not livin' in my position
My thoughts tend to glisten, just like a pot to piss in
And when I thought I'd risen, life freezes the frame
So I hold the mic like a memory to ease the pain

"I shine in spaces where time is just a glare"
"—hold the mic like a memory"

I sit back and reflect, on the wild paths in my life
Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
You know what blasphemy's like, cursing at God
'Cause you ain't got shit it hurts and it's hard
Hell at times I stepped it up to only stumble
Was forced to play Tarzan in this concrete jungle
Most of my life's a daze got me forever lighting haze
Tryna forget the times, where I barely ate twice a day
For, alone and helpless, so when I only felt the shame
Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
Few friends even then, most homies is fake
Feel like a prisoner in my home, pencil my only escape
I went from the block with my fam, to college exams
But the pressures still there, dog I'm still scared
But I know it will all be right in the end
As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen

"I shine in spaces where time is just a glare"
"—hold the mic like a memory"
Operator here's my dime
Connect me please
I know that she's at home

It's four o-clock on a Sunday morning
Who the hell is calling my phone?
Waking me up I'm stretching and yawning
If you had any sense you'd leave me alone

Wee hours of the morning and word is bond
I’m in jail I need bail. Again, the word is bond
Not James in a tux with olives draped on my cup
With a dame all on me with healthy letters to cup
So what up?
Can you free me ‘fore my prints get back?
And they run em through the system and realize that I'm black
All I remember was the stripper then I faded to rack
Said her name was December than she sat on my lap
"Merry Crimmuh"
Liquor and higher power my witness
I thought fleeing The People was just a matter of fitness
With all these nice drinks, compliments of Dennis
Whoever the fuck that is
"Dennis is this!"
Two middle fingers up
"Dennis is this!"
Dennis tab maxed out on titties and fifths
Whoever the fuck Dennis, is Dennis is pissed!
Cus I don’t think that dude we was drinking with was Dennis at all, fam!


Ha, Yup
Im aware it’s four in the morning
But I just wanna tell you im drunk and im kinda horny
I know it gets annoying, but I been losing my grip
Every woman I talk to I treat like a fair piss and it’s a bitch
Mainly cuz I now consider you one
I wanna let you go, but every time I seem to screw up
Now that’s the problem with the space that you occupy
It’s going great and then the thought of you would cross my mind
A box of wine and a carton of coffin nails will
Convince me now would be a great time for hate mailin’
Like "Hey bitch! How the hell have you been?
Remember me? We were dating and you slept with my friends!"
I just thought that I’d remind you in case you ever forget it
And train yourself to believe that you're not a terrible wretch
Ha
You broke my heart into like a million pieces
So here’s another dim-litted picture of my penis

Whoa!
What the fuck is going on Grieves
You saved my number under the wrong name in your phone?
Is that a picture of your...?
I'ma pretend I didn't see that
All that rain got you suicidal up in Seatt...ohhhhh
You had to much to drink again
Whiskey and a cellphone ain't never gonna be your friend
You booze you lose, homie you been warned
You better off using your cellphone to watch porn
Grab some lotion & a napkin
Jack off then pass out
All these drunk texts'll have you fucked off and ass out
I hope you black out before you do anymore damage
I checked your timeline, homie...why you Tweetin in Spanish?
I understand if this is what you gotta go through
But when you sober up I got some screenshots to show you
Grieves, bro trust me
And you gonna be hella happy that all of them texts didn't go through


Ooh! Ahh!
That's the angle
*click*
She's gonna love that one
They just sparkle and they twinkle, and I’m hypnotized
Her stare cut through, and I’m hypnotized

You know, I don't know if it's the ganja
The Red Stripes or the Appleton Rum I've been drinkin' but um...

Shorty
She do the damn thing
Fine as champagne
Hot, and the way that she trot
She only fan flames
A Super Freak, but please don't call this man James
If she put it on me, bet a nigga pull a hamstring
The type of strange that makes you forget your name
Amnesia to a player, she makes you forget your game
Coach
She got me caught up, like an alley oop
I can ride at Sally's like a jockey but she got me spooked
I'm feeling like a youth but
To tell you the truth though
I do wanna crush
It's
A little more than lust
Trust
I'm no Goodyear gimp
But she got me stumped
Lookin' Bubba Gump tryna Shrimp
I was a pimp bitch
Mixed with modern day Romeo
But today my pimp look more like Polio
Overdosed off of beauty got me comatose
Shorty so blessed makes the Reverend catch a holy ghost

They just sparkle and they twinkle, and I’m hypnotized
Her stare cut through, and I’m hypnotized..

The way her booty sway got me caught up in a daze
Wish it was maze, I'd get lost in it for days
Cause I be so amazed when it's jiggling in waves
Her body so sweet, I bet she sweat glaze
I'm long as three shoes when I'm staring at her boobs
But I be swimming in a gaze and made my inner tubes
They keep me so amused
Like two new Rubik's Cubes
Twins so perfect, so easy to confuse
Her stare is therapy for me forgetting all my problems
I'm victim to a vixen when swishin' in apple bottoms
Switching my position, trying to sit where I can spot em
Got em
Right there in my line of view
And then she caught me, but she smiled like she was so amused
Then she spoke, "your girl is right behind you, fool"
Snapped me out of it
Kinda slapped me out of it
Hypnotism is my prison, someone get me out of it

They just sparkle and they twinkle, and I’m hypnotized
Her stare cut through, and I’m hypnotized

She said he name was Gwendolyn
The only reason I remember it is cause it rhymes with pendulum
And that's the way her hips were swayin'
Otherwise, I can't recall a word her lips were sayin'
Damn it y'all I'm mesmerize
Her eyes they got me hypnotized
She got me shaking my head
But I ain't saying no
Lookin' her up and down, but I ain't nodding yes, I'm saying, "Woah"
I see her mouth movin'
I think my mouths open
Hope I don't start droolin'
Shit is in slow motion
I gotta say somethin'
"Uuhhh"
Nice goin'
Snap out of it player okay
Time to focus
"Did you just pinch yourself?"
"Cause you'se a dream come true"
I grew an inch myself comin' up with things to do
Oh shit she didn't slap me
Imagine that
Fuck it didn't happen
I just imagined that
Shit I blew it y'all
Where'd she go? I can't believe it
I hate to see her go
But love to watch her leavin'

They just sparkle and they twinkle, and I’m hypnotized
Her stare cut through, and I’m hypnotized
Call me
Put her out in the cold, didn't want her close to he
Cause his granddaughter's different than she suppose to be
Diluted her genes, it stopped the music it seemed
That they'd only seen polluted stream, and that wasn't clean
Said he could almost no longer stand the breath
From this pure horror, more worse than Amittyville
So what's next? Don't answer me yield. (yup)
This is a normal occurrence, not something randomly real
Ain't even allowed visits over a child's pigment
His in-crowd ignant, a situation "wow!" isn't it?
Hard times, baby daddy grinds to support
His mother and a few other friends privately in her fort
For short stays, ya know? but more aid was needed
Baby is like a year and a half now and speaking
More than I can say about that man with his child
They can't even come face to face and share smiles
Raining pure pain on her life by staying distant
Like she spawned a fucking anti-Christ or a Satan infant
Blatant mentions about family blood won't leave
Love's her deeply, but evil sends it's opposite feed
"old fashioned"
Too ever set in his ways to ever relate
If he could just set it aside, there'd be heaven to pay
Then, weathered and aged time swept him to grave
Love conquers all? shit. I'd say that areas grey

Old fashioned people they never know why (2X)
Old fashioned

Most don't even know why they believe what they believe, man
Never taking a second to look at life
Bad water in our seeds, y'all, still growing weeds, dawg
In the dark, walls blocking all that light
Most don't even know why they believe what they believe, man
Never taking a second to look at life
Bad water in our seeds, y'all, still growing weeds, dawg
In the dark

Looking at life in retrospect it's hard to regret
Stuck in your ways cause hatred is hard to forget
Niggas talk all religious trying to barter with death
Parts of the flesh wrinkle up while you start to reflect
And even though nobody's life is ever perfect
You start to wonder if all the pain was really worth it
Pondering the purpose of living, the curse that was given
Dreaming about freedom and escaping the prison
People who pimp children are really raping religion
The matrix is fiction placed in a vision
But now the technology follows me solemnly
Building the future laws to my philosophy
Alzheimer's cutting through like a lobotomy
Not even the golden arthritis of king Midas
Could buy comfort and peace for the righteous
I survived disease and political crisis
By backstabbing gnomes that are now lifeless
And now I live vicariously through my kids
Like people who love the sport, but can't play for shit
Fighting glaucoma, front the cops taking a hit
I slip into a coma, roaming over the planet
Leaving the gold and the granite, the old and the famished
But just before I vanish as I think I'm at the end
The sun becomes the light of my birth and I live again

Old fashioned people they never know why
Old fashioned people they never know why
Old fashioned people they never know why
The world is changing day to day
It moves so fast and leaves them in another time
"Close your eyes
You will see"

Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
I feel weathered, but feel like I've been driving forever
Showin' up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
I've been better, but all things pass
This life is taking everything away but you're provided with your past
So fuck it--I stick to having dreams on the road
But until this dream is done I'm gonna keep my eyes closed
And breathe, breathe when it snows
Breathe when I'm forced to live a life with a person on a phone
Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin'
Leave with the seasons
Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
Cause after the show when the last star shines
I can make this all better when I close my eyes

I'm in another zone where troubles gone
Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
A place where life is easy for everybody else
I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
But we don't know it where we don't show it all
For life ain't protocol, under sky, over law

I'm in another space where all the food is good
And there's enough for everybody in my neighborhood
Where all the grass is blue, where we don't know 'bout green
Cause money ain't a thing I pinch myself it's not a dream
Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldn't mean a thing

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
You will see

Between climbing and finding it not worth it
Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
I'm so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
I think of home when I close my eyes
So done with the smokes and fries
Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
Drinks I shouldn't drink, things I never write
Cities I never liked now it's like aight
Got merch table weirdos, bros who want to cypher
Girls who want to fuck, but not vice versa
My work is love no complaints I'm fine
Its been a long night can't wait to close my eyes

I dream of an industry ego-less
And free from the modern chains with these chains we're so deep in love
Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
Dreaming a publicist wasn't 2 G's a month
And where it's not about numbers and math
And I was content with really just a couple of fans
And my happiness wasn't relying on tours and a van
Merch sales, iTunes, MySpace and a band
With the front, front row stadium packed
And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
And scream at them "Look at me now, look at me man"
Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
Kept running and gunning gunning success in my path
Fuck being humble, humility is a step in the past
I woke up and realized it was a dream
Wide awake in the rap game, but life I'm asleep
You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
Part of my shine comes from the distance
You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
Is this business emotionally invested?
Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
Love is war, sex is a weapon
The mind is a mine so watch where you're steppin'
Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
Feelings are just filling in this half-baked scene
To make x-rated into nc-17
Then see everything she got she not shy
Our love below so dro we most high
Then wears off when what we wear's on
Again I turn away when what we share's gone
So...

If this is not the hardest part
I wanna part
Before it gets too deep
If passion dies within routine
I'll come clean
Leave me be, baby

Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Looking Back

Under the twilight, and we living the Miller Highlife
La Petite Mort, my lady we bout to die twice
I won't' surrender and you won't surrender yurn
Whatever happens after this moment's of no concern
But it's hard to stop the burn when you fueled by the friction
Increased heart rate only confused my addiction
We wired for desire, dangers to ourselves
Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths
My muse, sleeps deep within time
I go to her for credit though I need to decline
It's easy to cross a line and blame ya flesh for the crime
I'm sorry it's just the way we designed
My dear we should leave here, I'm talking bout one at a time though
Cause you got me changin' my mind slow
Leave here, says that voice in the back of my spine
As I awake and the moment rewinds
Yeah, I know it gets hard
But we made it this far
And we never gonna stop
Even when we reach the top
Of our dreams

I'm tryna reach the top of my dreams
That's why I'm mapping out the script
And slowly plottin' my scenes
They never get the picture
Even when they're watchin' that screen
That's why they underestimate me, cause I'm not what I seem
I'm quite different - entirely focused on making wise decisions
I'd rather risk a huge mistake than spend my life wishin'
I try to deal with every problem with the right vision
Cause when you're gone, it's just that coffin that you lie stiff in
Six feet under, makes me wonder
If I could go back in time and try to fix each blunder
That I made when I was younger, way before the hunger
Before these groupie broads was tryna save a brother number
See, I'm achievin' every part of my goals
And I'mma stay the same, no matter how far that I go
I think bright, even though inside I'm dark and I'm cold
Feel the pain in my heart and my soul - but I'm livin' my DREAMS
HOOK

At last rap has it’s Dr. Parnassus for the masses
Living a dream with a atlas as my mattress
Living a dream ‘cause the rent is fantastic
Haters get evicted on a daily basis
Middle finger notice waved in their faces
Let the door hit em where the good Lord split ‘em
PS...P players you missing the big picture
Get a million inch screen let your dream be seen
The world is a stage let your dream be scene
Backdrop and props for the finer things
Enjoy the spice of life on your fries and wings
And wash it down with something imported
If domestic ain’t the best at making you feel important
Aim high, poppin’ bottles will get boring
I can have Caviar dreams and Champagne wishes
Or a catfish sandwich with Champagne the stripper
Its my dream

Claim a victory for entering this world earth
Then play your symphony from city to the rural dirt
Beyond hurt, invert your neural confines
I hit the lines like I'm running in the combine
Intramural of the money, drink ya night caps
Dream big nigga, play that shit in IMAX
My dream theater's a perpetual climax
Make miracles, give me water I'll give you wine back
The troops in Iraq, Haitians in the Carib
Or my Arabs, who keep the faith and wear it like a scarab
Dreams prepare ya' for living they hold the key to life
Gotta be the sheriff when you have 'em try to read 'em right
Don't be impressed by things
That haunt ya' when you sleep at night
Just rise above it, right in public, catch an eagle flight
Tap that passion that's within ya and just let it breath
I heard it whisper words of wisdom would ya let it be
Please... Let it be
You try to get success directly
But there is one to destroy us
Sometimes the way is of need
Perhaps you may get ignorant

Do I gotta get ign'ant and show my pigment on the job
Slap the darkest part of my hand across jaws
These days and times with jobs hard to find
You gotta work a salt mine or work an assault 9
Most folks barely staying afloat through proper channels
And think the rich sit with black candles and slaughter mammals
And run the globe with mind control and designer sandals
But life's a skinny bitch, it's a struggle to get a handle
I'm about to just break bad, like Malcolm's dad
Be Meth Boyardee with a lab and a yellow cab
So I can get my picket fenceand and  yellow lab
That American Dream makes me wake up and scream
That consist of old money buying shiny new things
That I'm about to break as I'm creating a scene
You can use as an anthem for Kanye's tantrums
Cause I'm about a thumb and a finger away from snapping, DAMN


I'm early e'ry day, never took a vacation
Through mandatory overtime I always stay patient
Through all the petty dramas I'm calmer than a sloth
But the shit don't change like if Obama woulda lost
I done worked my ass about 2011 years
And I'm usually far from anything that heaven fears
But I'm feeling off-kilter. I ain't about to kill ya
But I am about to loosen up this filter. Here's you:
Jerking off to Halle Berry on the shitter
Then firing a nigga cause he's checking on his Twitter
You mad cause nobody's tagging you in all the pictures?
Well here's a good one of you tagging your wife's sister
Like THAT- See I been knowing ways to fight back
Vimeo of you saying you don't like blacks
Clearly though, full HD and in stereo
Your network's got holes, my dude, cheerio!


Look, success is just a thought but it can push us to the edge
Put it in our heads at an early age like the Pledge
Give our allegiance, while your at it give your souls
Won't tell you til you're grown that all that glitters ain't gold
Love to watch 'em race, love to watch 'em chase dreams
So dirty there ain't a cycle that you can make clean
Got the athletes juicing, singers getting naked
Rappers spending all they money before they even make it
Actors scared to age, shooting acid in their faces
Slaves to the ratings, every show is more tasteless
Faithless as angels cutting wings from their scapula
To trade it all in and be Dracula

Genocide in East Africa, but you watching Battlestar Gallactica
Filling up the data in the back of your digital camera
Taking glamorous shots of your mammaries
Surrounded by Vanity Fair magazine
And stuffed animals in the house your parents paid for
Built by hand on land people slaved for
Get ignorant, stay ignorant, in fact
Get belligerent-- If you feel my sentiment, attack
Keep kicking it, screaming for your sense of entitlement
Flip me off with the same hand you hold the Bible with
All that botox, every cream, every vitamin
Can't cover up the ignorance that's inside of you
I wouldn't lie to you
It can't cover up the ignorance that's inside of you
I'm on an island when my family speaks
As I palm trees
High as the sun of a beach
Right here, quite near to perfecting my speech
But my sleeping habits on average keep me missing my sheets
Yeah
In the studio blazin the beats
Or clubbin with fly birds, rubbin squeezin their Tweets
Flaked on my intervention, I've been missin for weeks
On an international binge with the friends that I keep
Then come home and roam around in my PJ's, for three days
Eatin sour cream n cheese Lays
Relapse itch hit, I'm scratchin like DJ's
Tracks in my veins show I'm feenin for replays
You say free bass? I'll be right there
I like mine with a nice cut and light snare
Get it to me rapido and I might share
Rappin makes me happy so, why stop why care
I'm hooked

I'm up every morning with my mind on a fix
Fire up the midi and let it slide in my mix
Takes from the craziness, I hide in it's bliss
Ride or die, protect my pride, the lioness mane
And I ain't talkin 'bout Jane, I'm playin Rick James
I'm talkin' bass head, nigga, let the shit bang
Moving keys, looka-here, watch us flip game
Ever since a minor the accord has been this strange
I'm in the dark with the black notes
I take humanity and capture it in rap quotes
From the cellars and alleys with the crack smoke
Through the middle to the top where the fat floats
Let's roll, nigga
"I can't stop" (Never)
"I can't stop" (I've tried)
"I can't stop" (Can't stop)

I can't stop feelin' high
I'll never come down

Too much pot in the brownie pan
Got me baked faster than the brownies, man
Have you ever been high from the inside out?
On the lawn in my boxers like the insides out
Carjack a Care Bear and just ride out
In one of them cloud whips with the OnStar chip
I'm so high, I hope you understand this shit
Jane was plain til' I ate her then she came too quick
Drink water while I'm rhyming but I still can't spit
My mouth is pure cotton like a t-shirt coughin'
If baked means potato then my brain is au gratin
Talkin to myself with my neighbors all watchin'
But going in the house proves way too hard
When I fall in the front door and land in the back yard
Physics don't apply, midgets in the sky
Skippin' round my head saying" "Negro you so high!"
Damn

I can't stop feelin' high
I'll never come down

Said I'm eye to eye with sky gods beside Horus
Feeling like that white man singing in the chorus
How'd I grow to be the tallest tree in the forest
Without putting green in a shell like a tortoise, huh?
Rigor mortised, higher than a lions chin
If this was symphonies I'm way up there with violins
If its a choir then, soprano octaves
In an opera, where God lives
Look, I know I'm soundin' like a liar but
These brownies was angel sex
Got a nigga high as fuck
I smoke trees ins through all four seasons
But I'm like gas prices, high for no reason
Call a nurse your boy's higher than Google Earth
And if I fell the impact would put me through the dirt
So let me zoom in, and get my zoom on
This weed is Neil Armstrong I'm on the moon blown

I can't stop feelin' high
I'll never come down
I just wanted me, some regular weed
With regular stems and regular seeds
Cause this shit here...
I just wanted me, some regular weed
With regular stems and regular seeds
Cause this shit here...
I’m a monster that don’t reside up under your bed
I’mma march to the beat that I put into your head
Send shots to your liver I deliver you death
You can barter your tomorrow but a martyr you’re left
Get you hot under the collar when my name’s on your breath
Click the starter on your Impala I’ll be there when you wreck
Fucking with me you better keep your feelings in check
Be the life of the party or a lifeless body
Get with me thinking you hard, you’ll be hardly standing
I’m the hardest of them all, you’re the hardest landing
Face first in the asphalt, your ass talked
Too reckless, now you helpless from the rounds you caught
I’ll teach your ass a lesson, outlined in chalk
Have you hostage in the hospice, high and trying to walk
I am bravery in a bottle, I am courage in a glass
I got the government’s approval, prohibition couldn’t last
I go hard

C’mon lets ride out
The whole family over for Christmas dinner
Let’s go through the purses and sell the gifts from your mom's house
They know you out here doing dirt for cash
Plus you the one unemployed, a couple dollars ain’t gon hurt they ass
I’m the only friend you got
You tried to sell me but you took a hit and eventually you just couldn’t stop
A couple of sniffs would get you lit but couldn’t get you to the top
Oh what an event when you got hip to cooking me into them rocks
I had you locked, you know it costs to come and see me
So fuck yo groceries, fuck yo bills, go on and pawn that TV
And fuck yo life, just catch this beam and take it straight to the dome
And fuck yo kids, the state’ll separate em’ and place em’ in homes
It’s gonna be cool, I know I got you crazy subdued
Ever since the 80’s played your whole community for a fool
And the ones that sold me smoke each other over new tennis shoes
They field niggas, I’m the definition of death, the real killa

I’m with the fiends on the block playing shoot em’ up
When I erupt makes it hard to know who to trust
People scared to test me since the 80’s
Anybody can get it, man woman or baby
Shots do not discriminate, impossible to eliminate
I disseminate, you disintegrate
I can come off as a prick, you might get stuck with me
I’ll prolly steal your girl if you try and fuck with me
Cause next to me you’re looking quite frail
And if you snitch you’ll be counting your days in white cells
Just needlessly in CB4, ask the CDC, no CD4’s
Cause the truth is I’m on America’s dick
Uncle Sam fucks the poor and it’s making em’ sick
Now their life’s in a tube, a downward spiral
Give a new meaning to going viral
I’m hard as they come

While we ranting and raving bout gats
Nigga, they made them gats
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs
We flavor the music, chop this screw that
Take you through church in a verse til you view fact
Holy ghost, from the lowly coast, spit humility
Facin critics cold fronts, blockin our humidity
(We own rap) fo sho as Cognac’ll twist yo dome back
Our tracks? See, they be nappy (but you can’t comb that)
Call it el natural sound of soul
You ain’t seen these darts or how fast they’ve flown
(From, ‘tween these parts and the ones ‘nere known
My slang bang with a twang and hang on earlobes
You hear Natti, hot as Caddies with no steering column on ‘em)
With enough lines to dry all the clothes that you own
(Since when did the south) get pinned in a drought?
(Not never been clever since big pens been about
Reachin whateva levels that’ll suspend any doubt
That we as bad as yo kids when this mics to our mouth)

I hear 'em talkin 'bout Southern folks can't rhyme
Some of y'all must be out your God damned mind
Yeah, it's about that time, we got that shine
Cause niggas been about them lines
Since when? E'ry since a "Pocket Full of Stones"
Ridin dirty in a Chevy sittin heavy on chrome
Ever since Goodie Mo' had Food for Soul
And them dirty red dawgs done hit the do'

(The Mason-Dixon Line, been across ya mind like night-sticks
Rain down on the game and fuck it up like white kicks
I might switch, south-paw), knuckle to jaw
(If another broke nigga spit about spendin it all
I spit the gems that you splurge to put around neck
So save that to pay back all your loans and debts)
A Maybach and a plaque, is that all you get? Shhhit
(We struggle to juggle talent with a helluva sales pitch)
Standin on southern dirt that helped America get rich
Ye’ ain’t gotta struggle with a shovel to dig this
Cold as no power, after hours in the winter months
Hot though (crock-pot flow)
So here dinner comes
Walk them shell toes down underground railroads
(Niggas fresh outta jail clothes, spittin like hell’s close)
And these words at slurred, maybe how you listen’s blurred
You ain’t feelin sickness served?? muhfucka kiss a curb

I hear 'em talkin 'bout Southern folks can't rhyme
Some of y'all must be out your God damned mind
Yeah, it's about that time, we got that shine
Cause niggas been about them lines
Since when? E'ry since a "Pocket Full of Stones"
Ridin dirty in a Chevy sittin heavy on chrome
Ever since Goodie Mo' had Food for Soul
And them dirty red dawgs done hit the do'
"These days they want to be criminals more than they want to commit crime"
"That’s--that’s not just crime, that’s the way of the world"

There's something about a vandal's lust
The lifestyles of the scandalous
Ain't nothing like it - america loves gangsters (ha ha ha ha)
Look at all the angel dust, the cocaine and the cannabis
Ain't nothing like it - america loves gangsters (he he he he)
Hate stones, but the man you trust
Cause its fun to watch cannon's bust
Ain't nothing like it - america loves gangsters (we we we we)
Gone off that gangsta gangsta (2X) (for so long)
Gone off that gangsta gangsta (2X) (and so on)

America loves Gottis, America loves bodies
Pacino counting C-Notes for shooting up club lobbies
While Eddie Nash controls bankrolls in Wonderland
Tony Soprano hits channels and holds down On-Demand
We wanna see it and some motherfuckers gon' wanna be it
Others are doing numbers that breed it, bleed it, can't defeat it
Bush, the political gangster, man you gotta be high
Gave plenty of orders for slaughters ain't swatted a fly
Modern day cowboys with shiny alloys for side arms
Hiding behind bombs, advanced cowards
In Jesse James ways we handled the Towers
Guns blazing for freeze framing the King of New York
In the moments we face opponents give thanks to "gangsta"
Maybe place Babyface Nelson in ranks to bank ya
Got enough angst to handle the handle and squeeze the trigger
But pop that in the city its "Freeze Nigga!!"


A-scare-ica lusts danger, danger, danger
War, load the tanks up
In the name of the Lord give thanks for anger
More major paper in "Gangsta" Gangster
Heats nerves and veins hearing words from pranksters
Anger anchors us, cinematic screens spew
Wrangler language, systematic schemes too
Change the brain up, divide and conquer
Mob on em, ride till their lives are contra'd
Monsters, driven by capital as a stimuli
Can never be too powerful, it makes us all admire you
We'll follow until we fall like fallen star from sky, I
Can't say it's impact hasn't hollowed walls inside my
Heart, my art, ummmm insane
Is it that smart to react dark when facing pain?
You ain't that hard, that scarred or that real
To go that far, for that kill, for that feel, now that's ill

It's 6pm again
And I'm tuning into CNN watching marines mow down
Crowds with machine guns
16 weeks training, Atilla the Huns philosophies
And now they're thinking we won't bring peace to these
Streets with the same techniques that shit's hypocrisy
This ain't Democracy it's a Survival of the Fittest
A country built behind closed doors with gods as their witness
Picture this
People can become so blind that their ears can't listen
Trying to save their souls with penitentiareligion superstition
Never done unto others but claiming that they're Christian
While God's children are sittin home praying and wishing
For answers to their questions
Herd of the Armageddon wondering what side that we're destined
Life be a war ain't no time for restin
That's why you give up your seven to five, just to stay alive
Trying to fuel the fire inside before the God in me has died
Eyes, wide, trying to look out through this labyrinth
Hoping to leave this earth with the same presence that we came with
Trying to steer my path in opposite on opposite directions
That man came went
My soul came, spent, I tried to get it back
Thinking that if my heart stopped that my body could relax
But there's no time to be laxed
Because there's a war all through creation
God's Warriors are dying and gangsters are their replacements
I swing in from the south
(Venturin' through parts of the South so dirty
You'll want to be given a bath)
I swing in from the south
(Venturin' through parts of the South so dirty
You'll want to be given a bath)
I swing in from the south
(Yeah, that's how we do it in the south)

Aw yeah, welcome to the South everybody
Creepin up outta the dirty south unexpectedly hittin' ya head
Like a stick of lead whippin' you, flippin' you outta bed
Cause on my block the sidewalk can sizzle an egg
And we as hip hop as a cripple with dreads missin a leg
Visitors get addicted and don't wanna leave
Blowin on trees from Kentucky to the Florida keys
Humidity floats in the breeze
And this is the only place where shorties can go to the beach and grow double D's
Like GOOD JESUS. Let me rub some lotion on your cleavage
Cause where we live summertime lasts about four seasons
Parties are real loud. Car systems got clear sounds
Birds fly here in winter. Chickens are here year round
And they ass is meaner, the grass is greener and tap is cleaner
Follow me and any questions just ask the leaders
And the blunted genius of CunninLynguists spittin it clear
Sippin beer on a postcard like, "I wish you were here."

So come on down, show and tell with some southern belles
Tricks with treats you don't keep in a pumpkin pail
Hospitality? we treat our company well
From Kentucky bales of hay way down to Florida shales
Gals with chunky tails, lookin' like something swell
Niggas and negrelles smoked out on country trails
You try and visit actin' ignant and startin' hell
Your trip'll last about as long as the XFL
Here, the weather's hot
Streets? we keep em blocked
Mardi gras in every spot like we live in a land without some clocks
From them Virginia docks, to Mississippi crops
Swing through Atlanta where them switches be liftin' shocks
So please leave all trash in the Herbie-Curby
Welcome to the dirty dirty, home of them purdy-girlies
Birdies ready for flight, dawgs ready to bite
The southern south-paw, but everything is all-right


But in the dirty south everything ain't all peaceful
We still got racist people with inflated egos
Got foul cops shootin at niggas like we some free throws
Rough nights, bug bites from Jumanji mosquitoes
Fiends that hug pipes, drug life, pills and needles
Streets with much hype and some like to kill people
And if you don't want cops cuffin you up after your freak show
Remember jail baits are developed so check IDs, yo
But still the home of black eyed peas, collard greens, that soul food
The home of southernplayalistic pimps lettin they hoes loose
The home of that bluegrass, red clay, zephyrhills
Cadillac grills, battle rap skills
The home of Miami Bass, 808's, and spring breaks
Girls with tank asses from VA to the Lando Lakes
The home of gold fronts, home grown skunk, the home of sippin shine
The home of everything under the Mason-Dixon Line
Been, down. Been down
Late at night, what's gone wrong?
Been down. Been, down
Late at night the bad don't seem so wrong

When night falls and all light's off
You'll get robbed where I live
Crooks and robbers, villains and mobsters
The nights got nothing to give
Whats gone wrong, when? Late at night
Niggas be stealing, when? Late at night
Niggas be killing, why?
Because late at night, the bad don't seem so wrong

Nightfall is curtain call for underhanded theatrics
Slugs travel through gun barrels
From hands that had practice
While rapist take the darkness
And make alleys they mattress
Jonesin' junkies twitchin among hookers with coochies itchin
Spreadin disease, spreadin they knees in different positions
In the abyss is children that get lost in the mix
Gunned down for fresh kicks or oppostie colored fits
Its demons brewed lewd manners behind tints
"Whats gone wrong?"
People sitting in position to help with distorted views
Only experience doses of night that's on the news
Or BET showing the glamour without the blues
Or MTV helping you pick out Jessica's shoes
Just construes how you're living, confusing your vision
Nights a politician because only the truth is what's missing
Dirty cops fight crime with dirtier ammunition
The night's salivating waiting for me to finish spittin


When them lights low and ain't no night glow from the moon
Scoundrels run towns, no hounds to hunt them down
Keep your sight low and get your life stole by some goons
Swindlers injure you, a criminal's heart's miniature
Men in the dark paint sinister art in the park
Son of the morning star? Stringing hearts like a harp
Playing melodies of jealousy, felonies strummed by
Hell and it's philharmonic, bewitching our young guys
"Whats Gone Wrong?"
We no longer seek light to give us power
That voice gets hushed by the rush of the Witching Hour
The touch of the wicked cowards that lurk in the dusk
In even-tide, heathens rise, searching for bucks
Anonymous and corrupt, assure obscurity
In a spell under it's viel, an impure security
We love it in our spirits cause we're suckers for lust
Most even fuck in it, we're too ashamed to be just
 (x2)

*A darkness carried in the heart cannot be cured by moving the body from one place to another*
Ridin' down the road...lookin' out the window
At times it can feel like home is when I'm gone
On only roads we roam, Cali to Rome
Me and everybody I love livin' through phone
Never been one for hugs, but I long
Across time zones for strength from fam
Who are only with me through video and digital camera
Lookin' for answers, seekin' the chance ta
Make up for time that got lost in these stanzas
The click of my heels ain't takin' me to Kansas
Thinkin' bout Tuck got me stuck in these transits
My heart speaks Sanskrit with no translator
My soul seeks a hand-stiched love and a prayer
Shit, I'm everywhere, but home, I'm never there
And some I care for say I'm February air
Don't even know the mayor's name in my own town
Been makin' noise but forgot how my home sound
"...but please don't leave me standing here, when the winter comes"

Listen up, I've been meaning to say this
I'm not the greatest, I'll never make that list
But everytime I come home, you're still there waitin'
In case I never said it, thanks for your patience
Never got rich and famous, don't get me wrong
There's a lot of different faces that listen to the songs
But there's no big time, never wrote the hit rhyme
Had to roll the highway just to go and get mine
And when I got it, I brought it back to you
Wasn't even sweatin' you was reppin' with a new crew
I don't expect you to hold your breath
Just know you're blessed, and let me get that open chest
Look, you've cried with me, you've tried to forget me
You feel neglected cause sometimes I'm busy
You still hold me down on the Southside, dig me
You always forgive me, cause you're my city
"...but please don't leave me standing here..."

To make it happen with this rappin' is a part of my goal
But leavin' you little man, takes a part of my soul
Believe me, daddy know it ain't gon' be easy
Better this then have you waitin' for the state to release me
Seein' me through glass, missin' moments to squeeze me
I'll be damned, I want for you all that I never had
No growin' up with hate for an invisible dad
Wanna hold you when you cry, tickle you 'til you laugh
I'm tryin' to walk a path, right now you don't understand
You two and barely talkin' and yet you my greatest fan
I love you more then life, you with me every flight
I leave in dead of night to keep from hearin' you cry
My luggage outta sight to fight off the say goodbye
If you could form the words, I know you'd say "Daddy, why?"
And I would have to tell you how this is for you and I
I'll be back 'fore November, but daddy has gotta fly
"...but please don't leave me standing here, when the winter comes
When the winter comes, oh when the winter comes"
"Gonna keep on walkin' forward, keep on walkin' forward
Gonna keep on walkin' forward, never turning back
Gonna keep on walkin' forward"
 x2
I'll be doin' alright. I'll be doin' ok
And as long as I can live to see another day
(Repeat)

Back in the sixteenth century ... way way back in the day
Nostradamus predicted the end of the world would be on May
5th... 1999 and I don't know how
But as I'm writing this that's only one day from right now
What the fuck
I pull up to Shell in my truck
Look up, "nah... Earth ain't about to erupt"
Open my door, get up, slam it shut, "Marv, what up
Lemme get a bag of ice and a stack of plastic cups"
For a minute we chat 'bout life and all o that
Then we dap. "Check you out tomorrow night, I'll be back"
Grab a bidi and light it, turn the key and start driving
Back off into the night and then I start to get frightened
Thinking "Damn! My whole life I was just a dreamer
I never got to put on a show in a packed arena
I wanted to go on Rap City and act witty
But all I ever did was put up with hoes who act shitty
What a wack pity
Was I choosin a road
That didn't get me there in time and now we're losing our globe?
Hold up, I'm losin control
Think realistically on it
What could fuck up a planet in one day without warning?
And even if the world does end, I can't be mad at God
Cause life coulda been much worse. At least I'm satisfied
At least my dad's alive married to my mother
I have a sister and friends that I could call my brothers
At least I have life. Some people, their life was stolen
Set up for a crime and behind bars is where they hold em
We got kids killing kids cause Earth is cold
Women using abortions as a form of birth control
It hurts the soul and leaves a scar on your conscience
But it's a blessing that I made it through this nonsense
So even if this will be my last night
At least when it's over I'll be doin alright...

Back in the 16th century, way way back in the day
Nostradamous predicted the world would be on may
5th, 99, three years later and change
The World Trades frame got struck by planes
Looking like God unleashed his fury and rained flames
Exchanged pain for how America came to fame
Cluthing my brain, my sense of security changed
Usually confidence was pure in me, now fear in my veins
Said "any of this shit could brang nuclear weapons
...any of this shit could end at any second"
If the Commander in Chief couldn't insure our protection
That's no more additions to my memory's collection
Missing me and my girls matrimonial connection
No child and videotapin' her first steppings
Or growing old and teaching grandchildren lifes lessons
But thankfully I got saved during them church sessions
So I thank God for earth's blessings... health
Not alot of wealth, but alot of peace within my self
Not a whole lot of forgotten pieces upon the shelf
Disclipline from loving parents, though they raised me
By the belt
When I was young, I was wild
(life) took it for granted
(nights) living outlandish
(christ) hope he could stand it
Now I do right.. wherever I can manage
The devil was eating me alive but I climbed out of that sandwich
Now possibly on the verge of having everything vanish
Feeling as if I didn't do anything as I planned it
Like I was trying to live my life right, but somebody panned it
But I still had love, when down helping hands lifted
Me up, outta the mud, outta the muck
And outta the dark and attitude when I didn't give a fuck
From them days in the park, alone, drinking gin by the cup
Through an exitless maze, wandering and constantly stuck
The blessings were always there, I just chose to ignore them
Shit started getting sweeter when I learned to explore them
Wasn't selfish with them, trying to stretch and contort them
And didn't let the world get to them first and distort them
So as I.. kick back and ponder on armeggedon
And I... spit raps about where my life could've been headin'
I.. admit that.. I do have a wonderful life
So if this night was my last, i'll be doin' alright
Searching' for answers is like searching' for Atlantis
I'm working poor and I'm just hurting for some chances
This school of a livings like prison on a campus
Show me the Monet, and the pixels in that canvas
Advance through my imagery, I view my evil deeds
When I went to Jack in Tennessee to erase memory
When I called on Mary J be my serenity
So I don't see that all my enemies resembled me
I'm feeling faceless heading for a bitter state
I'm trying to place but my heart ain't even in the race
I've came far enough that turning' back is time wasted
Imprisoned by fear, I don't need no iron bracelets
What's my fate, how can I escape my heart
Running blind, an open mind could break this dark
A major spark might just make a star in this....

Way under in slumber is my true self shown
A glass house cracked from a few stones thrown
Pane in the windows of a once happy home
I’m a Cheshire Cat laughin’ at the caged birds' song
A caterpillar shroomin usin’ fumes from my bong
To cloud a land wondering what fuels what is wrong
Lust in my loins, vengeance in my heart
Thrust from my groin that could populate an Ark
Thoughts in my mind only popular in dark
I can’t let come to light so I might suffocate the spark
That might just spark the fuse that blows my views of self apart
Opinions of my health, my self, and wealth go off the chart
My struggle to keep balance ain’t a challenge it’s an art
Outside my sleep is silent ‘cause inside the war is fought
Every night, as I fade to the...

Don’t give me that bullshit
Don’t give me that bullshit
Don’t let it take over you
Don’t let it take over you
Don’t give me that bullshit
Don’t give me that bullshit
Don’t let it take over you
Don’t let it take over you
I am the god of hellfire and I bring you (x2)

"Fire!" Hellfire can't scorch me (x4)
I'll see you burn

"Fire!" Not obtained by propane or lighter
Not a man gone' contain these flames they burn higher yell
"Fire!" and it's not on the roof, it's in the booth
Then spreads from the stage to the youth
Who all root for more
"Fire!" You can smell it in your clothes and your nose
See a hater closin his nose we closin the doors
They gotta bounce, cause I learned
Where there's smoke there's fire
Similar to the streets, where there's spokes there's tires
Keep rollin like X poppers, see them flames
They gone need dental records to retrieve them names
Of course the sheer force'll scorch upon contact
Zippo flow, here we go, let's all cock back and "Fire!"


"Fire!" Melt Antarctica down
Evict polar bears, help bring art to the sound spit
"Fire!" Like lit cigarette in dry leaves
Goodbye, leave, or die whenever your eyes see
"Fire!" That burns like a wound with a pool of liquor
Running through it like a molten river
Imagine hell like it's a motion picture
Hopeless folks roasting like it's a joke but sicker
Try living with "Fire!"
Not like water in mixed dranks
Forget rank, when enemies challenging this tank
"Fire!" Murder, death, kill with the grill
You've heard the best, don't sit still as you feel this
"Fire!" Folks catch chills off the skill it's
The Vill, ill will, liquefy shields with
"Fire!" Too late to secure the perimeter
It'll enter ya soul you can't control the limits of
"Fire!"
"Yo whats all that?" "I'm fukinwitchu"
"You disrespecting me?" "I'm fukinwitchu"
"Yo what's all that?" "I'm fukinwitchu"
"You disrespecting me?" "I'm fukinwitchu"
"These motherfuckers are thinking I'm playing
Thinking I'm saying this shit cos I'm thinking it just to be saying it"

Driving at Macy's, pissing in cologne bottles
Getting on a runway, drop-kicking supermodels
Smacking up vegetarians with hamburger patties
Tell an animal activist that I killed Lassie
Pimp through a Hindu temple with a leather suit on
Stomp through a Japanese crib with muddy shoes on
Deacon the Villian, always misbehaving
In hospitals playing concentration with Alzheimer's patients

Yo I walk through the oscars and smack the best actress
I don't give a fuck I'll rip the tags off a mattress
Do a back flip straight off a church steeple
Masturbating to naked pictures of Janet Reno
Slam people into doors, beyond retarded
In a double wide smoking crack with Tonya Harding
Roll into Def Jam drunk smelling like Hog's Breath
Ask DMX why he hasn't found his dogs yet


Send David Duke a video of his daughter inhaling black cock
Tell fiends Marion Berry's crib is the new crack spot
Give a legless man the prize for Foot Locker jackpot
Tell foreigners it's customary to smack cops
I don't give a fuck, WATCH, I pinch boobies tight!
Show Ron Jeremy's best at monastery movie night
Crowds boo me like "Ghost," I'm still flippin wind
The street team's outside slicin their Michelins

I force feed Richard Simmons a big ass bag of snickers
Challenge Christopher Reeves to a game of twister
Dip in your sister's crib with a Darth Vader mask
Violate her and later toss her ass in an elevator shaft
Hate to be crass and I know it ain't right
Unplug an old lady's life support screaming "follow the light"
Follow what's right? Hell naw, follow what's wrong!
Send Bill Clinton a gift, a new gravity bong


Go on Fanatic and tell the artist he's wack
Find us an anorexic and tell her she's fat
Be at the mall sucking on mannequin titties
Kidnap an Amish family and lock em inside a Circuit city
Tell a priest his nun secretly praise Satan
Switch a hypochondriac’s chart with an AIDS patient
Send Hillary the Bill and Lewinski scene in claymation
Send a retarded kid an Atari kit and say it's a PlayStation

Break into buildings crawl around in heater ducts
Roll through Ethiopia in the Oscar Mayer weiner trucks
Slow enough kids can almost catch up, mouths watering
Then I hit the gas and the clutch, passing em up
Sick, like I overdosed on pills
Ask Darryl Strawberry to autograph tightly rolled dollar bills
I oughta chill but you still might see me nightly
At klan meetings, screaming out "kill whitey"


Deacon - Yo I give a limbless man a wrist watch
Kno - Word up, man, I dont give a damn
Deacon - I fuckin' go back in time
And ask Marie Antoinette to give me sum head
Kno - I'll fuckin buy every Will Smith CD ever put out... with my own money
"Learn to adapt to the change
Or get washed away like tears in the rain, in the rain y'all"

The saddest thing I ever learned is relationships don't last
Or maybe I just feel that way cause of my past
Bad memories get to me when I drink mad Hennessey
Feeling cold and alone even when I got mad friends with me
I'll still see something that reminds me of her
I got so used to her that without her my mind is a blur
She found somebody quick. I won't find another for a while
She was about to be my wife and mother of my child
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
And the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
Like everything's changed and suddenly you don't trust her just the same
Then you find out some other man's been fuckin out her brains
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain
So much that you can feel it in your veins and you can't forget her name
That's when you literally go insane
And you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says

Wise Men say, "It looks like rain today"
Crackled on the speakers
Trickle down the sleepy subway train

I'll never understand how a girl can say she loves a man
And turn around and have sex with another man
I would have much rather been robbed for a hundred grand
Than to get interrupted and get a call that she's touching hands
With another man. Oh God! Another man!
I can't even cry. My tears been dry. That's why it's thundering
Hard out tonight and it's dark and it's cold
Cause the angels can hear my cry, and it's all in my soul
And all of them know I've never felt this pain in my past
And it's ironic the first place we made love's the same as the last
In the shower ... that's why I put the rain with her name
And my power to trust someone again has faded away
Other girls want me? Tell em it looks like rain today
I wallow in my sorrow, smoke, and watch tapes that we made
And one of them tapes is the day I got played like games in arcades
The day I almost gave up everything that I gained
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
And the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
Like everything's changed and suddenly it's on tape and you crumble
Cause you notice on the tape she doesn't kiss you, she just fucks you
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain
So much that you can feel it in your veins and you can't forget her name
That's when you literally go insane
And you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today to celebrate an electric life
Under violet sky
I pray you hear our cry
Please help us protect what’s right (Amen)

"There ain't nothin' in this world that could take your place"

Gather your thoughts, gather around
Painted arrangements mixed from a pallet of sound
A casket froze in indigo, royal and profound
Many stems like hymns once blossomed from ground
But while the reaper is king, we carry the crown
We weigh it out, dreaming, screaming or close to even
In this sense nobody's perfect, nobody is worthless
The system's imperfect, maybe we should measure in purpose
What is yours? What is mine? When do we serve it?
Being hood ain't the absence of good
Being square don't make you equal or fair, it's not an equal affair
Weak voices can't speak for a share
Speak choices with no when or a where, are you aware? I don't think so
Unless your cup runneth over and you still sip slow
Or guzzle til' nothing, complaining when you don't get mo'
See another's glass empty and you don't think poor/pour

The upper room is calling
What are we supposed to do?
There ain't nothing in this world that can take your place
The upper room is calling
It appears it's just for you
There ain't nothing in this world that can take your place

Faith, we treat it like a four letter word
While fear, we shout it through the ghettos and burbs
Hear me my Lord, come settle my nerves
I pray these words bring honor as the heavens observe
And to the sky where the birds will testify
Freedom’s a state of mind be free any day or time
Reality will make you doubt your actuality
The truest fallacy is man can’t change how he sees
So it’s death to reason, it’s left the legions
Wondering where to pledge allegiance
This is my letter to Ephesians, the rest, we need them
Through death, the best are leavin’

The upper room is calling
What are we suppose to do?
The upper room is calling
It appears it's just for you

Some people play the victim, some people play the fool
Some people pay the dealer while others pay the dues
I don't know what's realer, the struggle and the strain
Or the guilt that can be built within when making gains
Ain't no cheatin' death, you can't lie to life
Plus everything about you’s hiding in these satellites
Outside of the one day that Adam had it right
Humans are parasites, insatiable appetites
"So where do we go from there?" You ask
I think we all trying to figure that out?
One nation under a God kickin' us out
‘Cause America took and takes the infamous route
As we state from state to state let’s be great again
Let’s forget the salient struggle of each alien
Parade after you honor the graves
Of natives, slaves, women, gays
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera
Before R. Kelly had his teens
Wu-Tang had their C.R.E.A.M. 
Slick Rick had his rings
Crack rock had its fiends
Martin Luther had his dreams, Stevie Wonder could sing
Or Elvis was king—hip-hop was on the scene

Nah meeeeen
Go back like Hitchcocks' hairline
Taught Fred Estaire how to pop lock in my spare time
I caught a ride on Noah's ark, cus I had a pair of Puma's
And two chickens on my arm

That's true...... and when I came through
Noticed Noah was first to "check 1, check 2"

Guess who rescued Repunzel
Climbing up her gold weave, then made her braid her hair like Alicia Keys

Before EPMD met golddiggers fuckin for VISAs
I was the first to pimp Jezebel and Mona Lisa
And made em famous way before Eminem could flow
Even ran trizz with JFK on Marilyn Monroe...Oh

I'm so old school I was at the first supper serving soulfood
And Arroz con Pollo', but I bet you had no clue
That pilgrims were the first to name women after produce
And that was the first Road Rules without toll booths
Even when Adam and Eve sat by the weed tree
I told Eve, "Please don't tell him touch my weed leaves."
But after I showed him Cypress Hill, he loved fire
Then Eve left and became the first lady of Ruff Riders

Had a horse carriage, sitting on dubs, coasting
Smacked the thoroughbred in the ass and hit the 3-wheel motion
Since a Frank and Jesse James shoot-out in the streets
Had a scoundrel c-walkin', shootin' bullets at his feet

I had Michalangelo put down the horsehair brushes
Started doing end to end burners on buses
Trust this, put King Midas' touch to use
He grabbed my bead necklace now I'm rockin truck jewels

When lightin' struck Ben Frank's kite and sent currents through
He was the first to electric boogaloo
The wop, robot and helicopter on the pavement
And in amazement, he was even Harlem-Shakin'
 - scratching
"Blow the spot with some old school shit" - Rah Digga on Talib Kweli's "Down For The Count"
"I'm so old school"- Jay-Z off of "Jigga That Nigga"
"I'm old school like my dad is"- J-Ro on De La Soul's "My Writes"
"True, that's old school"- Mos Def on BlackStarr's "Very Well"
"I'll bust that old school boom bap all over this map"- Declaime on Lootpacks's "Episodes" (x2)
"From the old school I consider loyally true"- Big Pun off of "You Came Up"

Transylvania was flossed out... but the facts have changed
Like, me selling Dracula some platinum caps for his fangs
Throwing daisy dukes upon that Mary Magdeline dame
And she ran game, tricked me up out my platinum chain

I had American Indians sending smoke signals with hydro
Giving villages contact matching blunts with Tonto
Spellin S.O.S. with my eyes closed
Even battled Henry the Eighth with my rhyme flow
And made his wives my hoes

I told Jesus that GZA said sandles were feminine
So he copped some shelltoes and suede Timberlands
Remember when KRS ripped Shan? Do ya homework
That was Amadeus playing the Bridge Is Over

Moses parted two tables with a mixer and played great
With his DJ crates. Before him, we played tapes
I sipped fine wine with Einstein back in the days
M. C. Square was his stage name and he rocked gray braids

That was before we could sit and play, Kid N Play
Or Nefertiti rocked the first flat-top fade
But anyway... flip through ya history books
You'll see about a million pictures of these infamous crooks
Cunninlynguists!!

"Old School"
"Word"
*Gospel Harmonizing*

I arrive to blue skies and green rivers
Traveled the globe amazed how every scene differs
My esteem's on K2, I dream bigger
To Mother Earth I bow, like when a Queen enters
Life's so beautiful, it's musical I sing along
But it's inhabitants so quickly say I'm singing wrong (what?)
Well let's rehearse, I'll sing the hook you take the verse
Let's build a bridge, if you ain't feeling it then let's reverse
We'll make it work over time, with open mind
Hope is dying let's fix the broken so folk can shine
I want to help secure fortress, pass torches
Be boisterous about more than fast Porsches
And staying perched on porches, taking self portrait
After self portrait, you treat it like horse shit
Got all the beauty in this world and you ignore it
For you don't see the trees or the forest, you forfeit

We came from beyond the sun 

I arrived at the third rock from the star that you call a sun
And was greeted by the son of man, standing with the gun in hand
I come in peace, but I cracked up and laughed so hard
I almost fell to pieces, you seem to have a thesis
That you been onward and upward and evolving
Just as sure as your axis is revolving
As evidenced by your new technology
I think you owe your ancestors an apology
You've come so far only to forget
So much more than you know now, and I know how
You've been hitting reset on your history
Dividing and conquering yourself into mystery
It's no wonder why there's so much misery
And suffering, even as the gem of your system
The pretty little sapphire, refracting blue light
Digesting sunlight, sustaining true life
Used to be my favourite little tourist spot
I love the pyramids, now you wonder if I built 'em
A galactic pilgrim, soaking in the atmosphere
Nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to live here

We came from beyond the sun 
I am Phallaxor The Matter Lord
Master of war with plasma swords
Massive in form with acid pores
Mad for the taste of your planet’s core
Gnashed in my teeth, and I plan to hoard galaxies worth
I’m a savage
Bored, naturally, because the lack of sport saddens me
I’m a galactic force!
Who dares to battle when standing before me renders you halved?
When I warp through parallel paths to distort your atom’s order
The Galaxian Matador, dash at me
Within a flash you’ll see packs of me
That’ll be swarming within an asteroid storm
Here is your last chance warning, then I won’t ask no more
Did you get that?
Then I’ll hit you with that celestial bitch slap

Perpetual impact that your mind can’t shield
Weighing in at a gillion parsons it’s Zarcon Steele
Tentacles tatter your tissue, till torn, tender to the gristle
The pitiful pray for the victim, I evict the veins of the victor
No matter the matter you’re made of it contains the brains that I make haze of
Thoughts you’re thinking you thought are those brought to those that I make slaves of
The pecs your appendage’s pump is the hunk of flesh that I make caves of
Imprint the pattern of Saturn across your face like its make-up

You better wake up!
You speaking of Saturn - you late much?
If you’re reading the data it’s eight months till you see where the flash and the rings of my championships came from
Now you want light-speed?
Say what?
There is no one like me, Likely, so it doesn't take much
If you’re taking up space and you’re in need of a weight cut
I’ll sever your tentacles, then I’ll make ‘em a paintbrush
Staining a blood moon
Creative within one swoop - parted in four
The Cosmic artist of war, you could say that I was Sun Tzu
Plotting the gore
One-Two!
You can hold my weapons, I’ll punch through your core defenses
Then I'm shattering your orbital bone
While knocking the solar wind out of your solar plexus

You're outta your mind, this marble is mine
To break into dust and do as a line
Or roll it with space and lace it with time
Right after I separate you from your spine
I'm here to perpetuate your demise
I savor the hint of hope in your eyes
When I'm done I'm sticking my dick in a black hole and creating the sun
To shine down on your grave from
Wherever the fuck I came from
Pimping this planet from day one
Your earth chose me
Zarcon's so far gone in your galaxy balls deep
Weight of the world, fate has been hurled
Too close within arm's reach
Yeah.. Listen
Once upon a time fell in love with an aura but the horror
Said she couldn't love me till tomorrow
Oh the disdain when tomorrow never came
I was a moth to her flame named martyr
Met her on the Marta King station oh the irony
So many wrinkles in my mind, in no time, she would iron me out
Help me find what I was about
Give me water that could last in a drought, you see - me
I was lost, in the shadow of death
She had the valleys and peaks and with the shallowest breaths
She told me bout light, took me right to the crest
Showed me darkness, heartlessness parked in its depths
I was kept 'tween them legs where she refereed me
Was confused but her clues brought the best I could be
To the top, when she left
Thought I'd drop
But instead
Tilted head back and watched
You see 

She'll guide you through shadows... And to a star 

Yeah
When you took me by the hand
Friends who disguised they plans
Went from allies or fam
To enemies well I’ll be damned
Oh man, light’s so blinding dog
Amazing if you’re seeing I without a guide at all
Ninjas will hide in fog, predators close on prey
Sun will come out tomorrow, today he throwing shade
I couldn’t see it
Before I wasn’t hip but then our trip made me believe it
Guided me through darkness where the route ain’t known as scenic I’m seeing
These so called angels cast the shadow of a demon, the reason?
Envy, they want what you’re eating
Like they’re inclined to dine on spoils you been receiving
They ain’t help you grow or give you land to plant the seed in, it’s seeming
They only pick you when they see you are in season
Eden


1, 2, 1, 2
Let the goddesses guide us, goddesses guide us
Yo I’m solely dependent
On the benefits of the soul and those energies in it
Fuel the soul and power the motor
We been the descendants
Ever since she sent us the motive
Witches apprentice
Hold us Aluna by the shoulder to show you the road is
Full of so much you’d never notice
Legend after focus adjust though, and step closer
We kept going so y’all could see what’s floating in the waters
I go with the torch to the farthest corner for its over
We provide guidance, through this form of applied science
Writers alliance, we tryna shine a light behind us
For seekers to follow, beacon keep blinking eternally
This journey is hell that’s why I felt compelled when Deacon hollered
My people need reminding there’s some life lessons
How we the finer specimens of the divine essence
How to find direction whenever dead of night has set in
Challenge your fears
Shadows only appear when light is present
We guide you 
Through the darkest parts of life to spark a light or to
Help you to see a few emcees who’s here to fight for ya
Signs of victory reliance on the highest order
Shine
And to a star... 
You're sure to lose your mind 
"Dance for me," someone said
Emily shakes her head
Knowingly, gracefully
Emily would begin

She was a late bloomer, from Penny to Janet in a blink
Dreamt 'bout being Josephine Baker in the mink
Gold make-up like the Sphinx
Skin made to view
Body ornament, performances sensational
From rhythm relation to titillation through
Demonstrations of what she's made to do
She always told me that she wanted to dance
The only time she felt worthy of romance, damn
I tried to told her she was worthy a chance
But it's hard to talk to somebody in a trance
I just gave her a glance, enough to sang her blues
Be Pablo to paint her moves, be Langston to name her hues
"Emily dance for me," someone said, she curtsied and turned her head
She posed, with knowledge and grace she gave us a taste
With a look on her face that could be taken for dead

"Dance for me," someone said
Emily shakes her head
Knowingly, gracefully
Emily would begin

Are we crazy, deranged, to stand up for some change?
Dreams turn to schemes, which marionette pulls your strings?
Emily's enemy was Emily, feelin' me?
She only lusted the heel-toe kick to the symphony
And now she justified, cryin' rivers for sympathy
Which in end she finds out is simply misery
No mystery, her OnStar on destiny's roads
Ballerina wardrobe glowin' under the strobe
Twirlin' amongst dollars waitin' under the pole
For a slightly possible goal sometimes we sell out our soul
Can't help that, errrbody done felt that
Just ask your favorite artist whose heart has turned to pitch black
Ask some of these stars where they lost they sense of self at
Strictly being puppets in public is a setback
Yeah fam, that's Emily's energy
Errrbody's a dancer, I don't view you no differently, so dance

"Dance for me," someone said
Emily shakes her head
Knowingly, gracefully
Emily, she begins

She makes it rain with her tears
The evil, the good, legal, illegal, what's hood?
We see through people, but we don't look in ourselves like we should
We try to grow in the cold, so busy shoveling snow
That we tend to forget about the light that's warming our soul (x2)
If you wanna be healed then you got to reveal the truth (x4)

Set your eyes on the sun
What has brought you this far? (x2)

Is it clearer in the mirror when you look at your exterior
In fear of your interior voice
Some who the one with good game that cook caine proper
And offer it up to junkies as a choice
Seems to whisper to sistas to switch they mista
Simply to get that financial support
Then turn and make that same supporter beat em and
Mistreat em and leave em after breaking em for the sport
Got a married man licking his lips at ladies of leisure
Loins feelin the fever, rather cheat her than leave her
Love his money too much so it's cheaper to keep her
Cause she's a Teenage Love like beepers and reefer
Ain't nobody on this earth been perfect since birth
Sinning and doin the erk and jerk in Church
Then the next minute be back to puttin in work
Jumpin into them holes not lookin in first

If you wanna be healed
Then you got to reveal the truth (x4)
Reveal
Reveal the truth
Reveal, reveal, reveal the truth
You gotta reveal the truth, reveal the truth
Reveal the truth
You, you, you got to reveal the truth
How could she look at me and say "I'm going"?
How could she break my heart without even knowing?
She said she was going home to South California

She had a Cali beach body bearin skin I love
Even though Natti country as a bear-skin rug
Southern charm got her arm interlocked with mine
Kentucky-fied chicks talking greasy all the time
"She think she too good, she think she dope"
Bitch if she thought them things she’d be right bout both
She came to UK screaming "CATS!" all day
Bled blue since she used to watch Tayshaun play
Loved the color in the trees when the leaves would fall
In the south getting high like cholesterol
My kinfolk would tease her best of all
About her west coast shakes made of vegetables
Talking hella proper like reading a teleprompter
Long ass legs looking fly as a helicopter
But on final descent bad news was sent
Not a Hollywood divorce but a bluegrass split and she went

She said she was going home to South California
That's where she came from

Ayo I met her on the corner of Abbot Kinney and Venice
She said her life was a movie and finding me was the premise
Taught about love, she was willingly my apprentice
Sex like a drug, she played the role of a chemist
Supplying me with a feeling I never thought I could fathom
Cupid shot me right in the chest with his golden handgun point blank
Joint full of dank in my left palm
Riding in my ladyfriend's car coming down Crenshaw
Cruisin' through the city bumping Biggie doing 60 in a residential
You got me feeling like heaven sent you
So forget the rumors and what all your jealous friends do
Always put my lady first I'm so presidential
She's picture perfect with a small frame
But she had to fly back south when the fall came
I got the feeling that she might'a had another
She'll be gone till June, but she's mine for the summer because...

She said she was going home to South California
She said she was going home to South California
That's where she came from
Imagine the burning embers
They glow below and above
Your sins you won’t remember
And all you’ll find there is love

I’m cloaked in smoke but feel no flames
Folks float around me but I see no wings
No halos or hounds, pitchforks or gates
Or omnipotent voice that picks course or fate
To the life of indecision build a dreamscape prison
Where light isn’t manufactured but captured inside a prism
In a state between asleep and awake
Feels closest to hypnosis where the infinite wait
Then the fog dissipates revealing crimson fields
Crept on by a fawn with flaming heels
Eyes red as stop signs and a mane of quills
As it gaze past hills of diamond trees
I see a silhouette rest upon golden knees
For the body of a goddess and a face of dreams
A half-naked Meagan Good in a pagan hood
Kiss me on the cheek, we didn’t speak but I understood
It wasn’t Heaven that I was seeking but a haven I sought
A canvas of the mind painted with my thoughts


Everything ain’t what it seems
I wake up to find I’m inside of a dream inside of a dream
See buried deep beside the seams of my screams
Of beings and otherworldly things rarely seen
Might be psychosis or maybe I chose this
The night approaches every time the eye closes
I see a burning bush, feel like I’m Moses
Burn so much kush I feel like amosis
All my images are morgues and wounds
And every fork in the road moves through Freud and Jung
In the darkness no orchard blooms
A state so dark, sparks from the torch is consumed
It’s like I live in a fortress of doom
In the forest where the blood pores were forced from my wounds
My body aches from this lobotomy, a part of me shakes
Open my eyes, I’m awake, awake

Ashes are burning brightly
The smoke can be seen from afar
So now you’re seeing how far
Ashes are burning the way
You was manifested in an egg, developed in a womb
Born out of a moon belly, first day of doom
Crying out like you wanna be put back in there
Maybe later in an incubator for more care
Alone, get to your home and your cribs set
Put behind bars and you ain't even lived yet
On through the playpens, when will this fate end?
Parents can't make rent, money from the safe spent
Got building blocks out, making a house
Mama with her cheese blocks setting traps for a mouse
You watching her same loving hands that absorb pain, kill
You're learning that life's more than a board game
Still better line up the cubes in your Rubik's tight
Piece the puzzle together, there's holes in your views of life
Only for sure thing is years, but you gotta fight
Keep the wind to your right or hit the pen flying kites

Living in a world no different from a cell (4X)

Walk up the rectangle steps, take a seat on the bus
Backpack, pack that sack meal for your lunch
Four cornered blackboard makes you act bored
No use paying attention, now you facing suspension
So it's back on the block and the calling you square
Try to get the label off but you're glued to the cable box
Closed Caption clothes and fashion, so attractive
As you lay on a box spring and old mattress
Choices blocked off, childhood gone
Just future cubicles and retirement homes
But you can't see it happening, live savagely
Only thing you put passion in is Zig-Zag packaging
Swallow Oxycontins to find solace
You need a fix so you hit some blockhead for his wallet
But your gun jams and the cops come to take ya
And now that bullet ain't the only thing thats caught up in a chamber (chamber)

Living in a world no different from a cell (4X)

From a cellular phone to a cell on a phone
Or trapped in confession seeking blessing trying to atone
With no more casual pounds with the hand on the clock
Now locked in city block working Lucifers Lot
Down to box for success, is that truth or is it not?
In your room coping with stress
Smoking Kools from out that box
Shit ain't cool, in detention no flinchin, that shit ain't school
Coke sale for a quick sale, but April Fool!
Now your case is on the docket to face a box of your peers
And them bars they trying to take you to
Won't be nothing like Cheers
Just years upon years, till your last box is near
Without your participation incarceration ain't clear
If the plots you got are flagrant
It's best that you leave em vacant
Cause there's cells in your mind, that'll free you everytime
Even the tales thrown in these bars can't be confined
Just be patient, nothing in life is by design

Living in a world no different from a cell (4X)

*I recognise that sadness I'm seeing in your eyes*
*You wonder if it's love you feel or just a comfortable compromise*
What if I told you that the battle was on?
Would that rattle ya bones? or would you be down to kill in the name of the throne
Drop bombs on innocent people or innocent homes
With automatic weapons or military drones
While me and my friends play croquet
And make bets on which country liable to fold next
Under the pressure of my fingertips
Any day or any time
They just cattle
We don’t need they kind any how
Talking population control
Gotta make room for the young, so it’s out with the old
I got tanks that need usin’, I’m lettin’ em go
For the low and some c-4 charges that’s ready to blow
I got the ticket on sativa ‘cause my patnah the supplier
And all my homeys down to invest in my empire
Sink the economy with no natural evidence
They complain, but that’s a part of being president
If I could get away with murder
I’d take my gun and I’d commit it X 2

I could use worship as a warship, bible and sword
Turn men and women to minions over Heaven’s rewards
Promise Islamic bombers Heavens harem of whores
For taking out a couple of floors
The holiest wars bring profits/prophets and I don’t mean Moses
Unless he’s on the screen when the NASDAQ opens
Horatio Caine won’t be able to blame me
For the third party bodies that his followers slain
Ashes and burnt remains all left in the name
Of
Whoever you praise, I just made it a game
Called winners and sinners, but they one and the same
You can play along with us at home
We livin’ in Rome, destined to fall
Didn’t you hear? I ain’t worried about the views of the public and peers
Shit, Hitler was once Time mags' Man of the Year
I’ma get it with hope while I’m peddlin’ fear
I’m a wolf in a wool cap with robes to match
Leadin’ the flock right down the hatch
I’m the fox in the hen house, the Devil You Know
In a black Cadillac, wrist glistenin gold
On my way to eat steaks with TD Jakes
So if you wanna dine with Christ you gon’ need these tapes
And if you still don’t know how cold I am
Please turn to page three in ya church program
We the last of a dying breed
Steady searching for my kind's like a dire need
Everyday I'm watching liars eat and leech
While I starve, sleep and listen to the friar teach
Peace, everyday I pray for it
Every blessing I receive I try and pay forward
But sometimes, the sun shines
More like a gun line, boss, better call one time
Running blind on this strange journey
I hope I'm still alive when they bring gurneys
In this world where friends are more attorney then Bert or Ernie
It hurts me deep, peep, I'm steady learning
That when it's money, bet it's all good
Most Robin Hoods ain't got a merry man in Sherwood
Find a good heart, no Google search could
Brothers was killing brothers in Eden where we first stood

Last of a dying breed, I'm curious
All my people on lock down, Lord, mysterious
Say
Last of a dying breed, everybody here better stop now
Nothing's gonna slow that clock down, no, I'm furious

Should the good stroll off the Atlas, forsaking the hapless
Let the soldiers of the soulless prevail in the madness
Shit's real in the field when it's minimal rations
And all feel the hunger from the sum of the actions
Running thick as thieves, robbing through blurred lines
Levels of good and evil, graded on curved lines
The pinnacle's a pentacle, bewitching the cynical
Left stranded on the planet where the wicked survive
Say no to truth, while addicted to lies
Gentrifying, remove the hood like it was just a disguise
Throw the blank on, a blanket party, like it's just a surprise
The menace of what lives in a secular thrive
Penance on what gives and is eaten alive
Apocalypse approaches in the form of divide
Too many bees in the trap, bear hands in the hive
Reacting to what's sweet with the sting out of mind
I can't hold on, I can't hold on
But I just hold on, I just hold on

Lord why's everybody's puzzle missing pieces
Struggling, grinding, greaseless
No rhyme or reason in sight
I'm seeing the pain off in their eyes
I'm seeing that often we lie, lost in our cries
I'm seeing impatient parents
Blaming unsuspecting children
I'm seeing inpatients critical
Streets are dead from the killings
I'm like damn, blocks hot, not from the ozone
Through camera's cops watch these lil boys hold chrome
Stuck, teenagers, foxes and pups
On blocks rocks in they chucks, choppers watching above
They need love, not snug cuffs, federally fucked
Tis all an orchestration Hans Zimmer couldn't conduct
But whattawedo, most problems dun been discussed
But we talk about actions on the backend, and hush
I guess most of y'all must listen to Rush
Long as you all good, then everybody under you flushed

Everytime I try and help myself
Reaching out and finding no one else
I can't hold on " "Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in"
So anytime you feel your soul's in need
Realize you can depend on me
And let's just hold on "screamin' Jesus save me"

We slipping far under the ghoul yard
In grim tombs we some dim stars, batteries full barred
At birth, but it's hard to stay charged on earth
Cause world wide like girth, the wise are in dirt
Grandmama's used to bus us to church
Humming Hymns
Stretch out a fat meal on the table from something slim
Now we starving, faith on the back of a carton
To find it, follow tracks down arms
And boulevards in the south, park
Watch as mouth art paints audio visuals
Call it rythmical miracles
And parts what your eyes red see
Throwing change ups in your medley through headpiece
Still Judge, but dont Dredd each day, instead feast
Life's an unfed beast that eats bread and meat
That's either your cash or your corpse
So I just pray that the Lord helps me last through these wars
Ya know?
I am floating happy not knowing nautical course
Tie a wristwatch in slipknots and dock at my porch
Time is of no essence, the presence becomes presents
Peasants become pheasants and soar past acceptance
Current currencies worthless, fodder for feeding purses
With iron clad words I solder together verses
I’m trippin like I’m eatin’ the fungi
Leaving me cornered like the puss that crusts in ones eye

Listen
There's no light, just never ending night
And the weather's like a hurricane when land is in its sight
The sand within my hourglass could vanish any moment
And I'm trying to read the signs within the symbols and the omens
From the motions of the sea, to the color of the dark
This ocean of my dreams was more than cover for the sharks
Recovering these parts is like discovering my art
I wonder as I wander through my heart

Cus it starts a dream defferred
A clipped wing on a white dove
Seems absurd, a smudge on a white glove
Not seen nor heard like screams from the night's lungs
Cling to words so much that you won't budge
Fiends in herds who yearn for the white crumbs
Getting high like the city sky when it lights up
Thats what the night does
It hits your mind with the right stuff
To keep you blind with a slight buzz

The mind is like a puzzle that could never be completed
We scuffle through it's pieces, strugglin for peace it's
Hard for us to sleep and even harder to awake
The image in my mirror’s gettin harder to relate
I see me harbouring my hate and bartering with grace
But I couldn't be farther from my faith, or my face
Through this waste of my mind, may I find direction
I'm a waste of my time if I don't find it's lessons

So all welcome to this generous helping of self reflection
Night thoughts brought to life with incandescence
As the world twirls on the tip of our index
Staring into space one’s vision is endless

But glaring at the ground you can see where the end is

So just close pupils and be pupils and listen

The headset’s your desk the test is what’s missin

Disect these notes of quotes of keys written
Don't worry about this dirty south til its mud floods ya front stoop
Aces and acres of haters growing out the same root
That hit you quicker than poverty in two major arteries
Havin you movin and softshoe-in like who made you property

Black face and sambos, tied for last place
Let facts state, we like Wildcats in a rat race
At that rate, the state stay ahead of tomorrow
Standing out like mount Kilimanjaro

So through this Bluegrass follow sorrow
Blacker then the ghetto you fear
You disappear like the future of the ghetto you near
Where index fingers bring the heavy metal you hear
Block stars loading guns as fiends battle for crumbs

Come travel through slums, try politickin with pushas
Made block decisions, while mothafuckas overlooked us
Under the radar like helicopters on the sly
Crept in with hoods on, KKKY

KKKY, more then what you thank it is
Ain't just tobacco, some bourbon and where horse racin live
This is for my Mark Makers, I keep my flask tipped
Live where the grass crip, steppin in my blood

Don't try to play Mike Vick and stick a dog in this fight
Ya art of loud bark don't veto your mosquitoish bite
The mc's too dark, the producer too white
Fam the lyrics too loose, the beats is to tight

We parry blows, we bury foes through stereos
Keep an aerial view over scenarios
Some niggas, that move spirts like a liquor store
AA, after 12 steps you back to get some more

Makers of Woodford Reserve that curve ya nerves
We country, coming with fists while you armed with words
Field nigga brand hands that'll slap you to sleep
From the land of hard liquor and tobacco that's cheap
 We rose like Lazarus, a miraculous feat
Put soul in it gave what's left back to the streets

But we all artist regardless of the art is in speech
Close Kyn, make notes bent tryna find a release from this
I don't have you
And like true friends
And say, "I'm sorry you're blue"
I don't have you
And like true friends
They still come around

I'm waiting for growth to show up and for hope to manifest
3 A.M.? I'm awaiting awake to hand me rest
Fate to send caress and a face that I can feel
With weight from heavy breasts
An embrace that helps me chill
Grace that human males can't feel
Unless he builds with a female until time stands still
When we take off our shells and chill
All before fingers learn bodies like we got blindman skill
She speaks no evil but says whatever
After Shaking up bed-feathers still prays together
On a parlay flip, permenant private party trip
The next Ruby and Ossie Davis, I'm talking great shit
Up walking late, lit. 4:25, high
Her mighty fine thighs silhoutted by sky-rise
Place the know how, behind my eyes
To take something unfortunate
And show them they're a fortune in my life
Look KY side, lend me a hand, send me a plan
A Remy Shand message of love, tell Cupid we fam'
And to clock something that'll learn who I am
As I learn with, chillin out, watching our hourglass sands


Spent Pubescent years, blessed with peers I could trust
Spinning records to a game of checkers after dusk
Laughter rushes out of mouth, clutchin my stomach, abs burning
From fast learning, not cash earning
Cause we wasn't really on 'at yet, just yes' y'alling
At this point, our lil' brainchild was hardly crawling
But had fallen enough times to keep a nigga's head strong
Fucked with enough spiders to charm a mama leglong
We's dead wrong, many days and nights
Trying strange thangs
From jane to cane and variants of the same change
Get trapped, you off map, no Peter Pan scenes
Where everythings tight and lily whiter than Klan dreams
Tryna get something ripe, a nice woman queen
Stay strong and fight life, like Sudan kings
Pray to make cents for giving
And make sense out of living
Lord give me patience to gain wisdom, please
I remember as youngin'
Slummin' with my crusaders
Garcia Vegas, burglarizing neighbors for Segas
Lil schemers, countin' Beemers, Benzes & Acuras
It's tough to count blessings when battlin' Count Dracula
Life's fangs'll drain yo blood in floods
Can't wade in that water because of rogue scuds
Role models taught us you oughta just roll up
In life there's no love whatever yo role was
Find wealth
No need to find self
Stand in line until you find your spot on a shelf
(Sold!)
Don’t mean to sound cold, got my soul singing baritone
Feelin' down low
To think
Of those in this winter with no mink, or folk
Weathering this desert with no drink to cope
Some chain smoke with no link or hope
Just dope, tree and a rope

You are the living truth of life ooh ooh
The fastest can’t run from who they are
I’d run from self but no man can run that far

Turn the page, eventually I hit a certain age
Learn that all the freedom was worthless when you’re afraid
Success can often be a perfect cage
Searching for a way to stay the same while the world will change
A prisoner, trapped in the regret
Cuz the ego can’t keep up if they happen to reject it
Sometimes you want so bad to be respected
Goin’ after it ‘til you’ve left your happiness neglected
I’ve seen the weakness in grown men
Playing games with their pain, they cheat but they don’t win
Seen ‘em feed the needle deep into their own skin
Tryna find a fleeting bit of peace in that moment
More success to fix what’s left
Take an even bigger risk like after this I’ll rest
Til he painted with the razor on his wrist a red
The color of lips, pucker up it’s the kiss of death

I’m Bustin’ Loose, no Wilder, just a Pryor (prior)
And that debt was paid in spades and barbed wire
Later use eyes to weigh and move fire
Then moved crowds in wades with hellfire
Meet a fan, kick it witcha, take a picture
Sign both titties and give a pound to your mister
It’s been real
Realer than steel I’da grabbed before I picked up a pen and a pad
Shit, it’s been chill
Chiller than the look in the eye of a junkie when he’s looking to buy looking to fly
Pyrex on the good eye of a broke stove
Pyramid of cans, tin foil with poke holes
Soft white girl break your nose and gets harder
Revenge of the Caine , the original Get Carter
Take your favorite star, make him into a martyr
Life ain’t Trending, it’s ending
See farther
What'll you do if there comes a day when I lose my way?
What will you do?
Oh I would stand by you (Word?)
Pray for you (Oh yeah?)
If it would help I’d even die for you

I spent too many nights drowned in seclusion
Over against my own will, surrounded by illusions
Fighting to stay positive, however losing
Cause my personality was founded on the conclusion that
The human heart does more than just pump blood
It pumps love, at least I know that mine did once
But a large piece of it was undone
And washed away by painful rains but when the sun comes
Scars heal and we learn from our mistakes
Some people sometimes their purpose is to hate
But be certain of your faith and you’ll acquire the ability
To expose witches and burn them at the stake
I’m looking for love, I’m done searching for a date
I've been alone for years, but it’s worth it if you wait
Personally, late’s better than never at all
So when I brush myself off, whenever I fall, tell me
What'll you do..

Oh yeah? That’s what the last one said
Unfortunately I was mad misled
I ran on E til no more gas was left
The most I got from her was ass and bread
But trust was lost like Kanye’s fashion sense
Accidents happen when you live with the weak
But it’s not an accident when you make a conscious decision to cheat
That’s enough reason to get into beef
Throw all your spouse’s shit on the street, quit & retreat
But these are the breaks as told by Kurtis Blow
So please for my sake, stay by me, this earth is cold
And I’m freezing like I’ve been lying in dirt and snow
I’ve searched the globe for a person who knows
The true meaning of love, you could be the one
If you mean what you say we could link up
And use what we learned from our exes in the past
But wait cause I got another question to ask and that’s…


Sounds good and if you mean it, I’ll hook up with you this evening
Hug your body squeezing your love while I feed it
The touch of a king when you’re my queen
And trust is the the key in every relationship
But other human beings who see in may try to rush up for no reason
But looks can be deceiving
Like books you never read and only judge by the cover art
So don’t let it crush your heart when they try to use jealousy to pull our love apart
That’s when the thunder starts followed by the rain
But the first line of this song already explained
That my arteries were drained, now all of me is tame
So stay beside me cause I don’t wanna be estranged
Two warm bodies on a page
As soon as time found them they were saved
And still lay there to this day
But if this should ever change
And if I ever lose my way
Just stay and I’mma do the same
The darkness of the night has gone
Gone
Gone
Crystal drops of morning dew are gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Crystal drops of morning dew are gone

They trying to kick us out the hood, niggas want us (gone)
So stressed, smoking good 'til the marijuana's (gone)
Crack a Corona, just zone while I'm sipping on it
And start to count the last days 'cause the shit's upon us
They trying to get us out the hood, them people want us (gone)
So stressed, smoking good 'til the marijuana's (gone)
Crack a Corona, just zone while I'm sipping on it
And start to count the last days 'cause the end's upon us

Victims on the pavement
Folks who can change it all (gone)
Leaving new jacks with nooses to swing with
The Carter got a dog park, smoothies and sandals
Thanks to the pimps, pushers, hustlers, and vandals
And heroes they slander hit them with scandals
Or literally kill them let the world light candles they (gone)
And they ain't coming back black
Unless it's on a street sign, shirt, or a snapback
Underfunded school headstone or a back tat
Located in a trap that snap when the rat snack is (gone)
And the beast is full
No brown on the streets where baristas rule
And two fingers is the only hard peace to pull
Which is cool
For the tenants that's in it
But for hostages of the hard knocks commuted the sentence
To a brand new prison they can sit 'til the bars are all (gone)

They trying to get us out the hood, them people want us (gone)
So stressed, smoking good til the marijuana's (gone)
Crack a Corona, just zone while I'm sipping on it
And start to count the last days 'cause the shit's upon us
They trying to get us out the hood, them people want us (gone)
So stressed, smoking good til the marijuana's (gone)
Crack a Corona, just zone while I'm sipping on it
And start to count the last days 'cause the end's upon us

They been killing off the elders
Now the village full of hellions
And the people want rebellion
What do we tell them?
Children are resilient
But their Innocence is (gone)
And what are we to teach them?
When all the grannies are beneath them
And the families are divided
Sanity is declining
Searching, but I’ve been told the silver lining is (gone)
This is when fear talks ears off
Many corporations calculate what a tear cost
Morals break down like they biodegradable
Too keep the faith or give it up
It’s highly debatable
We've lost our mind
Crossed all lines (Gone)
Are the lights that shine in the darkest times (Gone)
Revolution
We in the midst
I’m hoping this as bad as it gets
Before everyone’s (Gone)

They trying to kick us out the hood, niggas want us (gone)
So stressed, smoking good til the marijuana's (gone)
Crack a Corona, just zone while I'm sipping on it
And start to count the last days 'cause the shit's upon us
They trying to get us out the hood, them people want us (gone)
So stressed, smoking good til the marijuana's (gone)
Crack a Corona, just zone while I'm sipping on it
And start to count the last days 'cause the end's upon us
"But I went nearly crazy
And I went clearly crazy"

On I-85 North, going nowhere
Would hit the 400, but I ain't got money for the toll there
Traffic backed up ahead of me, I see the road flares
School bus on my right, kids laughin' with brown and gold hair
Replaying conversations in my head by my ex-wife
From the house work that I did, to the kids, even our sex life
She said I was crazy so I threatened to prove her dead-right
So she got court orders, restraining me, put on the red lights
Frustrated, thinking how the fuck could I clean it up
Traffic stopped, about 1000 degrees in my truck
Loosened my tie, wiped the sweat out of my eyes, mixed with tears
Mind thick with fears, I've lost everything that I done built for years
Bright yellow school bus fucking up my limbo
Kids bitchin', cussin', flickin' boogers upon my window
Start rolling it down for some air and the handle breaks
Kick my door open, dive out, feeling some escape
"We said vows and shit, that shits' for life right?!
Yeah, that shit's until death, death...
That shit can be mended
But that bitch don't be listening to me!
She'll prolly throw a fucking fit and shit!
I'mma go there that bitch is gonna listen to me
She'll see I'mma fix this shit, FUCK THAT!"
: "Move your fucking car, maaaaan!!"
Motherfucker is my one car really haulting movement
I got some powerful shit in my trunk want me to use it?
I grabbed that shit, cocked it now talk like you're silly!
If you needed some release would I fuck with you, Billy?
"Look away lady, before I swiss cheese your Mazda"
Am I crazy for wanting my babies to have a father?
Gonna show my bitch of a wife she better work a little harder
Stop them kids from screaming, it's pushing me even farther!
It's my daughter's birthday, Billy, you like this gift?
Your name's not Billy? Really? Then why do you react to it?
If you're an actor, am I your fuckin' audience?
Kids, look how many different directions his body went
It's okay, I'm not crazy, I got kids your age
Don't be afraid, I said don't be afraid! Behave!
Now y'all be cool now, I'm leaving now, it's beyond hot
'Bout to visit my wife after hitting the pawn shop for more Glocks
I got some shit to fix (sinister chuckle) I got some shit to fix

Today's about to be one of the biggest days of my life
Cause I'm about to ask the women I love if she'll be my wife
I just know that she will, for this women, I'll KILL
I used to clean dishes at Micky D's, now I'm on grill
So I've been able to save up enough money for this necklace
Along with this ring for when I pop the big question
But my manager's been stressin' the way I been dressin'
Tellin' me I need new shoes but I can't afford to get them!
He's all about perfection and does shit that I hate!
Today he wrote me up and I was only five minutes late!
And then he threatened to take me off grill and make me scrub plates
And the toilet where people shit out all the food they just ate!
AW FUCK! I'm starting to hear my screws bust
Screw it, I'll do it, He gives me Windex and a toothbrush
Now I'm scrubbin the toilet like, FUCK MY BOSS and HE STINKS!
I'm asking my girl to marry me, fuck what everyone thinks
Let me look at the ring now to calm me down like my shrink
NOOOOOO! I JUST DROP IT AND NOW IT'S LOST IN THE SINK
And today on my lunchbreak my girl's supposed to come through
I wanna ask her but without the ring what'll I do?
Dialogue:
: Wassup baby. Listen I wanna tell you something
: "Yeah?"
: Well, we've been together for a long time and...
: "Uh huh..."
: ...I love you more than anything in this world... Will you marry me?
: "So where's the ring?"
: I... I had one but... I dropped it in the sink...
My... my manager... he... he made me get off the grill and clean the toilets
And...(sob)
: Yeah... WHATEVER! I'm seeing somebody else anyway, loser!"
: Grrrrrrrrrrr......
FUCK YOU FOR REAL! SNUFF TO YA GRILL! SMACK TO YA FACE!
FOOT TO YOUR CROTCH! Look at the cops...
THANKS FOR THE GAT! RAT-A-TAT-TAT! CRIME IN THE ACT!
BITCH, DO YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT???
SICK cause my mind just snapped pretty hard!
Fatality... RIP YOUR TITTY OFF!
Pull out the gun that I got from the cop
And make her face look like Barbecue sauce
Bite off her nipple like it's on the menu
And spit it out the drive through window inside a Pinto and leave the driver
Crippled
When I fire my pistol like it's a missile. (BLAOW!)
Start to hear sirens whistle I've lost my mind, it's official!
Grab my manager's pencil and stick it in his eye tissue
For having a time issue, go to the bathroom and try to kick through
The sink. I made a mess and shot cops. Let off a couple of pop pops
ON THE CLOCK let me go before the alarm stops
I'mma take this damn ring to the pawn shop
To get my FUCKIN money back... (cries) fuckin bitch!

Ignition contact in my little compact
Nissan piece of shit and I need to quit
Funneling Night Train pummels my right brain
Feel the pain of a hangover, I smell the faint odor of piss
I need to lower my risk
Hittin my liver with this liquid deliverance
I'm fuckin laughin and stuck in traffic
As my 8-track tape deck pumps some wack shit
It's drastic
I walked in on my friend with his hand caught in my wife's panty elastic
While she was wearin em!
Started tearin em a new asshole verbally
I don't think I hurt em
Twisted off the MD and Bourbon
Got the straight vodka in my coffee thermos
Put on my game face and walk in the door
Of my job at the strip mall discount department store
Dialogue:
: Dan-O! Happy Birthday
: Thanks!
: Oh, before I forget uh, we're gonna have to let you go Dan-O
: What?!
: Yeahh, we've been monitoring incoming packages for a while now, we noticed you have a fetish for naked pictures of Janet Reno and Will Smith CD's. Yeahh
: (crying)
: Hey, uh...what's the machine gun in the paper bag for?
No, Mr. Johnson! YOUR ASS IS FIRED!
Heres your pink slip get hit with six clips
Salespeople out front, I ain't forget y'all
Split y'all, and everybody in this strip mall
Walk in the Dollar Store and just let off
Now even the managers body is 50% off!
Hit up Toys R Us and bust my shit
(ratttatat) TRICK LUH DA KIDS!!
Music store massacre, cus theyre trying to tell me
21.99 for a Nelly CD?!
Verizon fucked up my service so they ain't out of the woods
Can you hear me now? BIATCH!(gunshot) GOOD!!!
Shop owners, cashiers, even the patrons
This is punishment for gettin caught in my matrix
The chance for survival is miniscule
I see two dudes walking towards the pawn shop they bout to get it too
Uh-oh! Here comes trouble

I'm so sick, of all these rappers, MC's talkin' 'bout they thugs
Yo we been thugged out since Cub Scouts, you know what that means?
When y'all were breakin in line, we were breakin spines
We didn't have no slip knots, we had nooses
We have Girl Scout cookies, reach in here if it breaks you'll feel 'em!

THUGGED OUT SINCE CUB SCOUTS - best believe
We are guaranteed to make you bleed
Jumpin out of swings, kickin in teeth
THUGGED OUT SINCE CUB SCOUTS - yes indeed

Yo; bailing on my Big Wheel, dressed to kill
Jeans with the knee pads, slanted Raccoon hat
Wiffleball bat in my holster, rollin
Supersoaker filled with piss, patrollin
Thugged out, get drugged out of your own treehouse
Hangin hives on jungle gyms, lettin the bees out
Girls want beef like Arby's, melt they Barbies
My Cub Scouts were a miniature sinister army
In the cafeteria didn't let shit slide
Hit guys up for they milk and shepherd's pie
You want extra pizza? Here's yo' slice {*blade sound*}
I'm the line leader BITCH, run yo' Nikes (give me your shoes!)
Hit y'all, thought you knew I'm the shit dog
That's what you get for rollin all hard in kickball (fucker!)
Fartknocker, you better hope class lasts
Cause at recess your ass is grass

No doubt, I been thugged out since I was a Cub Scout
Hoppin off my BMX, punchin niggas in the mouth {*BAM*} (ooh!)
A little bad-ass nigga, fuck hide'n'seek
I was gettin a whippin from momma like every week
Splittin' niggas wigs and takin' their G.I. Joes
Lunch money, you name it, baby, I got to have it, yo
Talk shit and feel my hands grip ya fuckin throat
Girls hated me cause I would always steal they jump rope (bitch!)
Now let a bigga nigga say somethin stupid
Smack him with the bat, lay his ass out flat
Why must the nappy head boy, be like that
Where's the home trainin? He's like an animal with no tamin
Who you blamin when your son gets snatched up
Smacked up, Derrick Green again, he's bout to act up
And while you playin dodgeball I'll be tappin jaws
Here comes that boy again! Yo he's worse than a Chuckie doll


Jugga Bully wasn't at all popular
Until that day I beat down the hall monitor
I used to use small binoculars
To look at girls through this hole in the wall
That led directly to the stalls where the broads lockers were
And they were usually all topless or leanin over to tie their shoes
That's when I bust through, and make my move to grab at least 5 boobs
And this ain't high school, this is kindergarten
Juggs was into arson, burned the media center into carbons
I guess I had mental problems, but then again
I think my problems started when the school nurse put me on Ritalin
(Blame her!) Y'all put sugar in gas tanks
I put boogers on the substitute's glass and he drank
I had pics of a hooker with the principal, gettin his ass spanked
I guess I had a passion for pranks
I wasn't scared of the teachers (nah)
Juggs was gettin head under the bleachers
Durin the Pledge of Allegiance, that's what I'm bout

Hey! Cuttin in the lunch line, what you thinkin dawg?
I'll stab you dead in yo' eye with a Lincoln Log
Oh you think I'm soft because I rock Izod?
Pull out the sawed off ' "Oh my God!" {*chkchk-BOOM*}
Even though I never been hauled off to juvenile detention
I done things too vile to mention
I was too demented; remember when Baby Jessica fell in the well?
I threw her in it!!
I always been a sick kid
Took hella Valiums and all type of doctor's prescriptions
And when the Den Leader gave me stress
I smacked him in the grill with my Merit Badge vest
Nevertheless, classmates learned never to test
Unless they want a spitball stuck to they neck
Oh you think it's funny? I'll beat you down
Screamin out my buddy, my buddy, my buddy!
{*singing*} My buddy and meeeee!
"That boy's one mean motherfucker!"
It feels alright
So just lay back into the night
But don't lose sight
Make sure you watch those Yellow Lines

I'm DUI in her eyes, but fuck tapping the brakes
Let's shorten up the time fantasy take
Stroke her ego slow til' her vanity quake
Satin hair, silk skin, wet panties and lace, the
Fabric of love, the thrill of the chase
Blunted, lovin the highway, spinnin in place
My hands are Sex Pistols, strapped to her waist
Strange fruitin lip gloss, try and savor the taste
We can both play games, exchange fake names
Paint pictures of lust using both our frames
Remain unaware of the spell you under
Prisoner of love when given my cell number
High off love, lust in your joints
Kiss and tellin the tale of our sex exploits
Yo relationship sank out to sea
Now you floating on driftwood behind fucking with me


I put a spell on them hoes
I have 'em in the corner on Patron at the shows
I can tell when they ain't from around here
The spell start working when my finger say 'come here'
I'm not a pimp, I'm not a trick
But please believe me I can have any bitch
They call me short, dark and handsome
Kidnap your girl, send your man a little ransom
(Hey) Hey! I'm making major moves, won't you holla back
Hoes twisting my hair with some o' that beeswax
At the club she say she don't dance
But she bouncing on that hot thang in my pants
Ya got money, take her out tonight to eat
She coming over after you finish with the Applebee's
Bobby said slow down, I say go slow
I'm the reason she don't fuck witchu no more
I'm the reason for her being on the pill
I'm the reason Sir Charles had to chill
To get her freaky don't need a bottle of gin
And we be fucking like the world 'bout to end
Ey, I put a spell on them hoes
Forgive me Lord, but I'm hell on them hoes
Yeah, I put a spell on them hoes
Forgive me Lord, but I'm hell on them hoes
Hey, I put a spell on them hoes
Forgive me Lord, but I'm hell on them hoes
I just, I put a spell on them hoes
Forgive me Lord, but I'm hell on them hoes, hell on them hoes

She used to call me late at night
Didn't take long to see that we were a-alikes
On the same page, just couldn't get it right
Macintosh of my eye, let me take a mega bite
I cordially invite you to come take a ride in my thoughts
Switch memory lanes while we dreamin, wanderin
And in return I'll strip my inhibitions
And go skinny dipping in your stream of consciousness
She said it sounds tempting
And I don't want to catch feelings
But this urge is calling me bad
I said well sugar, if you're worried 'bout catching feelings
Chances are you already have
And there's no need to deny ourselves
I mean, lie to each other and deprive ourselves
Denial's not a game I'm prepared to play
So I express things most niggas scared to say
Put a spell on 'em, Forgive me Lord but I'm hell on 'em
Baby we grown folk, So let me longstroke
And send em back to they man with my smell on 'em
Let me be quiet before I tell on 'em
I had a dream and it was so strange, so strange 

Ah, deep perspiration, heartless and impatient
My angel's just a devil from shoulder to shoulder pacin'
Fillin' my gaze with hate, eyes cold as Alaskan basements
Aimed at records for targets while labels look like the Masons
I hang around outside of they buildin' amongst the vagrants
Dangerous, loaded stainless, maturity plus minority
Cool as cues, but cocked back is the priority
One in the flesh, lights, cops just stop where they stand
As I proceed to beat the publishing up outta this man
Tellin' him "Get the fuck up!" They yellin "How could he stand?"
I don't expect him to, bitch, I counted close to the land
Louisville slugger cover every inch of his noggin'
Bobbin' with every strike, askin' "What heaven like?"
The reverend might win a visit, that is if his spirit is near it
But if you yield towards hell you'd hear it more vivid
But I'm under slumber, ya get it?
To see it I'd have to let you all...

See the things I dream 

Yeah, once upon a time I seen it clearer than the bluest day
Got off in some crime seen that line turn blueish-grey
Humorin' themselves about murder, pussy and politics
Word around the world is money and I want all of it
World crooked like St. Ide's eyes acknowledge this
Just ask them Virginia Tech college kids
While you wait for apologies, I'm low like a fox
Get between me and your rocks, I'll put your ass in the box
I feel the odds favor robbin' a world without God
Money's the language, in humanity you need Visa cards
I need your cash and your car before I smash your facade
Or watch this classic toy make you collapse to the side, under the yard boy
Since a child these thoughts lurkin' in my shadows
Heard 'em placin' wages on how will I face my battles
Accelerate to add dope feel but never faulted
I'm standin' upon rock that'll make powder out Gibraltar


Fumblin' with sweat on my fingers, somethin' impetuous lingers
Become infected with feelings so I'm electing this evil
To end my life without reason cause I'm indicted for treason
Closin' my eyes and I'm leakin', draggin' the knife till I'm bleedin'
Cause it's the life that I'm seekin', feels only right that I'm meetin'
With Jesus seeking redemption but he don't want my repentance
For he who feels my intention sees that my deepest impression
Is feeding me to these demons that lurk and feed on my essence
The pain is deep in my chest and I keep repeatin' my blessings
Ever since a meek adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
Parents repeatedly sentenced, heroin needles on dressers
They use to feed their infection, I can't repeat indescretions
So I pause for reflection, long for honest affection
And getting lost in the music is only soothing for stretches
If you knew where my head is when I'm doing these records
You'd never listen to my music again, I can't let you.....

See the things I dream 

I will know how things can be....
"I want to live a real life..... I don't want to dream any longer"
The Format
If we gonna start from scratch, you start with wax
If there's no dish, then there's no rap
Records, albums, vinyl, the facts
Give us a stack of records and we'll give you 12 tracks
The agreement turned cement
40 years ago
Hip Hop, the vinyl frontier
The embryo
Two turntables a mic and a cold stereo, DJ, one MC, the imperial
Many many put their muse to it
Sent bop, sent rock, sent blues through it
From classical to jazz we can who’s who it
Or blow the dust off and groove to it
Lets ride
B-side on direct drive
You know that crackle give the best high
Give me a needle, a cartridge, a partridge, some tree, 45s and a 33, let it be

A new format hit the scene like way back
It was smaller and more convenient than 8-track
You could pop it in your car on a long drive
Play the album or fast-forward to song five
If you passed the song you had to rewind it back
It was kind of frustrating trying to find a track
Memorex, Ampex down to TDK
Where the Biz was on the radio with BDK
When they was on the air, I was on the pause-button
I had the best taste but I ain't trying to cause nothing
Cause everybody thought their paws was the raws
Cats used to battle, this shit used to cause wars
We would trade tapes, that was the best it could be
Busy Bee had the fever for Treacherous Three
Having the best tapes, was like a status symbol
The yellow tape, purple tape to the baddest demo
Battles travel from the Bronx to Baltimore
They would stand by the speaker to record them all
Them same tapes that was labeled with a thick marker
Made the neighbourhood rappers want to spit sharper
If my tape pop trust, I was ready man
A razor blade, scotch tape and a steady hand
I call it surgery
My cassette went under the knife and brought back to life
Man that worth it to me

If you want it, I got it
That which makes you move
"It's... the format baby"
If you want it, I got it
That which makes you cool
"It's... the format baby"

My relationship with bass and kicks had come full circle
Plastic and cheap but I clapped to the beat
Stab the repeat button and keep running
And that's something you can't get from tape dubbing
Skip the skips with a flick of the wrist
More time to check what's sick on the list
The fickle dismissed this little digital disk
But try and play vinyl in the whip, it'll skip
And it's '96, I'm trying to get laid now
Chose the format with binary laid down
1s and 0s, and 0s and 1s, flood the BOSE with flows and drums
Blunts get blown in my homie's truck
We sitting on chrome, little bone thugs
We got wheels, we ain't trying to walk man
CD's nuts, there's dust on my walkman

Follow me entering this digital odyssey
Holy matrimony but harder to see
Everywhere but non-existant, what a conundrum
Upgraded but they say we forgot where we come from
The past feels even further with every second
Off the record, the coming and going of Kbps
In the day of the instant message
The message is misdirected and the receiver seems to be disconnected
But don't complain, love game
Even after the flood came and left our neighbors over-saturated
With no computer love, just computer bugs
Hate the virus and not the hacker, that's what a loser does
Meanwhile, the kids are playing shoot em' ups
Trying to be the 2.0 version of Super Thug
Press reset, any era you wish to visit is next
Hold on as we eject
What is the Question?

Now when I see the man in the mirror
I see an animal clearer
The teeth look sharp, and and ain’t a man that’s much realer
I do somersaults and flips with nunchucks like a ninja turtle
I’m very bold, I’ll sell crack on an infomercial
I tell you what, if I don’t get the props I deserve
Imma leave you bleeding by the curb, and that’s my momma’s word
Bank account, commas absurd
Cause I sell specialty rap music, and sell out concerts
My favorite spot in the sporting goods, is the hunting section
They got slingshots and crossbows, and other types of weapons
Camouflage vests, and fully stocked with the lead
Next aisle over I can go fishing instead
And to the fake ones, your salaries low
Flow cornier than VH1 romance reality shows
Y’all know, I used the body wash to clean my shotty off
Cause its been catching back splatter from hacking through body parts

A southern rebel that’ll leave your vital levels flat
You won’t be hot until you die and give the devil dap
You about as stupid as that pot that called the kettle black
I be conscious rapping but now even Gepetto’s strapped
Here to take the ghetto back, hush the whack stanzas
Taking it back to when rapping was talk ‘tween Black panthers
I’m Huey, Newton or Freeman, all of the above
You ain’t even Huey Lewis, ain’t got no power or love
And what’s sadder, you won’t touch rungs on Jake’s ladder
Universally unworthy of time, space, or matter
You hot as in anger, not as in magma
Deac is Death Valley, You are A-laska
I mastered the range, you mastered the lame
And the day that you’re the flame, I’m the rain
Strange

Big booty Twitter vixen, this is something tight 
Even make your main chick say she quite 
Some dumb reason say her prison be 
Fell her gaze blazing at you – laser beam 
Face is the bomb: body’s detonator 
We talkin’ black folk filled elevator 
Think its cool now? Fool later see us 
Every time you leave think you out being 
Stick to her, forgettin’ she’s gonna tell you hell is 
And she hope you go in summer when its even more 
Eyes even glowing terminator red 
Shit would be a past red dot beam 
Shoulder so cold make an igloo seem 
Pushing all the buttons make the topic seem 
This gold made cup make us sip so 

All these girls man they just want to sweat some starve
But I don’t get gassed up like an electric car
And I don’t need a ski mask to rob these bitches of they innocence
I'm at the strip club, seducing seven Russian immigrants
Single moms is so DTF
I hit it, quit it, then report the bitch to DCF
I’m so Bobby Brown, not the new edition days
Never stop my ignorant ways
Not as long as pimpin’ pays Ap's 

In the strip club, all the dancers look 
Damn all the money stickin to ‘em, cause she 
Back sweat make em look 
*Laugh*
What’ll you do when the people go home
What’ll you do when the show is all done

I can’t
I won’t
I, no

I’m 25 now, yeah I told my pops I’d toss the towel in
Making music no longer easily makes my smile bend
Though, "WOW’s" from the crowd’s ain’t end yet
Them smiles and back pats still ain’t helping the rent checks
Ain’t far from crack packs if I hursh these verses
Flippin words shit for an empty purse feels worthless
Listen, word of mouth done been a blessin and a curse
We reach heads but the only bread we see’s off shirt sales
Tours and shows spread all over the earth, well
Recoup gas and hotels, back to this dirt, Hell’s
Far away though, believe I ain’t complaining
Rather explaining, that unless this southern rain end
We’ll show proof we’s as real as you
Needing a roof, some shoes, dolla bills and food
Two from The Dirty met with mismatched skin
Acknowledged first that one day this track may end
When there’s no more steam in that engine
Yet hopefully clean streams be an astringent
But needs outweigh cheese tryna stay in contention
“For the love” is a hard reason to keep my life in suspension
“For the love” is a hard reason to keep my life in suspension

“For the love” is a hard reason to keep our lives in suspension, yeah

What do you do when the people go home
And what do you do when the show is all done
I know what I’ll do in the alone of my time
But what will I do with the leftover wine

What’ll you do, lay it down
What’ll you do, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down again
Poor me, pour me a shot of patron
Cigarillo or bordello I just gotta be blown
In a silicone zone where titties are grown
And sessions in the recession where fifties are thrown
Rose petals, pedaled within cities of stone
Reefer and liquor dance, my chemical romance
My pitiful cold hands
That ache to be warm
Like a tux with gold cuffs that waits to be worn
Nowadays
Loves in the haze of a flashback
Those that invest deeply need be gettin’ they cash back
Being in lust with love, feels so dreamy
Till it’s shattered in beautiful pieces scattered beneath me
I still chase it, you gotta believe me
I just don’t think it’s as instant as an instance on tv
We try to close the distance but persistence ain’t easy
There’s a ribbon in the sky if you listen to Stevie
Problem is, my arms can’t reach that far
Or stretch that high, is it best I fly
With the wings of a goose, mixed with red bull
And a night cap slapped on to keep my head cool
Awaken in a state of confusion
Dressing quickly to get back to my city
Fuckin’ delusion
Where I live
Where I stay
Where I sleep
Where I lay

I’ve seen all the things that pass me by
Oh why can’t it be real?
I cling to my dreams as I grab the sky
Oh why can’t it be real?
Here I am standing naked
Your search for answers will end in agony
Here I am standing naked
(Me too)
One thing is certain that is my destiny

I give you everything, yo
Standing in front of you naked crying again and I feel like a tyrant
I told you once that I loved you more than music, I was lying
But I swear you’re the closest second
And I am the most depressive
But you really make me better
And I really tried to let ya
This angry love a lecture
Vulnerability measured
You calm me with your presence
When you leave me I get reckless so I’m retchin'
And hopefully I throw up all these Catch 22’s
How could you win when I’m losing me fool?
Sucks to be truth that we through but we not
Catch us in bed it’s so oooh! we three hot
Maximum pressure for you to see right through my heart
You so smart you can pick me apart
Playing the cards I was dealt as an only child with a single mom
I got Abandonment issues for days and if you make me mad I’m gone
So I’m wrong
Now come and make me right while my eyes are dancing
You see just how I’m standing
Plus, I’m a cancer


Naked as in ass out, dusted without a cent
Sex was twerkin for us and love spray was the scent
Made it rain while we singles, so emotionally spent
While building our house of love she came short on the rent
Fell head over heels, but couldn't feel the decent
The quicker the lights flicker the quicker the liquor hits
I was feral, out to get lucky
Her ass was heaven above me
And I was dying to go there
As soon the spirits touched me
Club lights can turn Misses Fugly to Misses Fucks Me
Cus I ain't talkin slick trick, don't confuse it with rusty
We left our love in that condom under your sister's truck seat
My bucket wasn't fly enough for you after our first meet
No need to be thirsty, no need to rehearse the
One night standing between you and your next me
Send me a nice picture, you still thick as a swap meet
But stop callin, breathing hard and whispering to me softly


Yo, you prolly thinking that you know me, huh?
Know me so well that you can’t show me none
Well I showed you once, I know that
I told you only once, and what you do?
Take the full nine yards and scored a touch
But your hand went right through me you, thought you know me huh? Thought that you could see me when you woke up
But you woke up and you know what?
You prolly realize that you ain’t know much
The Cold Crush, the so what you told your homies for four months like
"We was so drunk"
Even though you learn to roll blunts
Now how you think I feel about that?
You used to feel my tracks, feel my raps
Tell me who you finna' know as real as that
It's true, you could see right through me but see me truly
Don’t think that you could screw me and tell your homegirls you used me
Like you didn’t know this nigga?
Know such and such and know so and so
But honestly?
I know how you really feel when you close the door
And I’m right there
Mr. Invisible in your right ear
It’s funny how one night can make you feel like it’s a year
But yea, for real
(Scratched) Knowledge be the key
To unlock your brain and set your mindstate free

What? All eyes. Pay attention

Non-familiarity makes you scared to see
The beauty in front of your eyes
You're thinkin' merrily
Everything isn't a predictable occurrence
If you've experienced everything except a purpose
Then you've missed everything that was meant to be caught
Life sessions aren't lessons that can be simply taught
You gotta feel the matter
Build the data
You gotta strengthen self or your shield will shatter
In the field, we choose to scatter like lice
Instead of coming together and keeping it tight
It's hard to be alone, deep in the night
I try to avoid the dark life and be seeking the light
But so many times I fall in between the lines
Of what is a devilish sign and what is divine
If you base your life on wasted nights with no faith in sight
You might as well freebase on pipes
I've fallen down but I got up friend
Fell twice
Three times
Got up again and again
And again, it's nobodies but my fault it didn't end
You only don't win when you give in
The days we live in
Send shit that'll break the strongest
I put on my body armor and remain the calmest
Being peaceful at heart helps me see through the dark
Like dogs barkin' it's hard for evil people to start bullshit
With a literally cool kid whose only form of battlin' is through music
If you hold yourself tight you can't lose it
Life or death, it's up to you who you cruise with
Exercise knowledge to increase your wealth
If you know yourself you'll be shown your wealth (x3)

Sometimes I ask myself a question
Is my lack of inner reflection
Some type of indication of what state my life is in?
They keep piping in elevator music
Sappy and happy as hell with foo foo shit
When I reflect back and recollect that
I was born into the state of walking slumber
Taught numbers, realize I'm dirt poor
It hurts more now that I'm older
Showered in water much colder than this
Holdin' my lips and close thee abyss
With the speech and the phoniest kiss
Rendered lifeless
Talk about an identity crisis
My third eye remains sightless
When the night hits
Can't help but lie awake
Contemplate fights with vice grips
Depressions and lessons in starvation
It's hard to be patient
Sittin' perfectly still, listen to your own heart racin'
Assume the description of my life and it's reality
Is on the warm side of fatality
It's not fair the way you challenge me
Or the silent way my talents be
Hidden inside these translations
Emancipation as I try to dab the slate clean
Futile attempts to make my fate glean
Hate seems all inclusive
It makes me want to fall reclusive
And rip the tallest loose-leaf
With a makeshift facelift
For my mental state
Huh check it out
