Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (igh!)

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

La la la la
Uh, yeah, uh, opportunity be knockin', let a motherfucker in

Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby

All my life I was a fuck-up, now I pull the truck up
Same bitch stuck up, now she wanna suck us
See me hangin' out the window, screamin', "What, what?!"
No more tough luck, a different cloth is what I'm cut from
Baby, oh, my lord
The cops chasin' Bronson in an all-white Ford
Shit, I'm on that all-night tour
Bitch, I'm alright, but I'm off that raw
I'm in a robe dancin' salsa on the top floor
You would swear I'm Puerto Rican, but I'm not, lord
Hot hoes every city that we go, singin'
"Heads high, kill 'em with it now!"
Uh, all I do is eat oysters
And speak six languages in three voices
It's Adriatic Summers on a sail boat
Don't even try to call, I'm not available for nothin'
Unless it's stupid paper, hop out the Studebaker
With Anita Baker, uh

Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby

Uh, I feel so alive, I think I shit myself
I should kiss myself
I'm starin' at the man inside the mirror
The reflection shows a wolf though (AOOOH!)
Goddamn, I'm still cute, ho (Yeah)
All my women play the flute
Saw me plate some melon and prosciutt'
Left handed, make the Fender cry
Count money with a reverend's smile, the Devil's eye
Half-Cherokee and Gemini, uh
Motherfuckers'll dump heat, from Jump Street
And turn your chest plate to lunch meat
I'm in a Humvee, lookin' like a young me
Now these motherfuckers all wanna be chubby
I switch the season, now the hair's curled
Tan skin, I need a bad girl
Cause James Brown said, "It's A Man's World"
In a Transam' Twirl, the burner handle made of pearl
That's just "Daddy's Little Girl"

Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby
Praise the lord, I was born to drive boat
Feeling like Slash in front of the chapel
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul
Shit I smoke is like cholesterol
Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival
The best of all, had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call
Best believe that there was neck involved
Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab
Uh, we took acid for ten days straight up in the mountains
Started running with the stallions
Playing frisbee in the West Indies, did the tango with my kidneys
Eyes open, now I know just who my kids need
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Buried a million in the sand, by the clock tower
Before I die, take a hot shower

Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset

By chance I seen her in the lobby of the Ritz
With her man, the one that swings a hockey stick
I was wearing all white, and my hair was looking precious
Shit, I might cop a chest and a dresser
A little machine to make espresso
I heard your bitch still wears Ecko
Hide drugs behind the box of De Cecco
Live from the Expo, it's me
I wear the wolf in the winter, steer the coupe from the center
Who gives a fuck, I'm a sinner
I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans
Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin
Bite the eel by the dozen (Got to take it for the team)
Bite the eel by the dozen

Pump the bass in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby hand
Except this toy cost 80 grand
And I'm crazy tan, from all the places that I've been
Just from writing words with a pen
Tell the pilot "Land the plane," on Roosevelt and Main
Put a jacuzzi on the seven train
And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face
I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste
The brass band was seven pieces, my bitch's name is Peaches
We got twin Mac elevens with the features
Shit you barely got sneaker money
So much dick in their mouths, that's why these motherfuckers speaking funny
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya
(I can't hear ya)
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya

The Magic Johnson of the game
These lames don't want to play with me
Smile on your face, but I really know you hatin' me
I know you mad, cause I'm sick, and it's plain to see
It's me

Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
La musica de Harry Fraud
Smoke something, biatch!

Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

Leave the party with your daughter (little Debra)
In the morning do karate in the water
Hear sounds of samurais
Rockin shorts in the winter don’t fuck with splinters (rats)
Roll with sinners — A bunch of winners, catered lunch and dinners
Why my drug jar look so empty?
Drop a hook and then I’ll probably cop an M3
Long knife ('chete), that’s in the event
Somebody try to get me then to Heaven they’ll be sent
Oh, off the strength, caviar and Porsche taste
All the beans are gettin' Boston baked
On thin ice, I skate across the lake
With the CCM tacks, my feet are like Cassius
Smoke premium cabbage

Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

Yo we 80,000 shopping malls but we ain't browsin'
Poppin' hood in Transco Towers
Prowler prowling Gucci towels and bathroom vials
Nouns, owls, Aston Martins
Sparkin' one in valet parkin', loan sharkin'
Hopin' that my days-don’t-get-darkened
Cheetah skin outside the parka
Propaganda propels us – ostrich feathers
Security guards with 9 berettas, pullin' up Volkswagen jettas
Causin' storms in sunny weather, in sunny whether, in sunny weather
Hopin' that my days get, hopin', hopin' days get, days get better
*coughing*
Smoking fucking thanksgiving turkey bags man
Surgical procedures
Ben Johnson
You already know

Sign my name with the feather, tap dance under the full moon
Smoke and drinking liquor for the fam that left us too soon
Just keep it truckin', searching all the nooks and crannies
No english muffin, streets are filled with crooks and trannies
Bam bam got a shooter like Lagassee
Emerald green paper that I split up with my posse
One hand driving, 3 gram smoking
2 fiend sucking, tea bag soaking
Strength of a retard the drugs are even stronger
Shorty loved the longitude, dealer bring a quarter through
Over fishing make the snapper less affordable
I hate when stupid bitches ask me questions that's rhetorical
Like "do you want to have sex?", well bitch, it's obvious
Her name was Jeta from the former Yugoslavia
She grew a bush like a baby plant
Still I ate it, just think of it as bucatin' and razor clams
Smuggle cheeses in a baby bag
And then I serve at a private tasting
I got no time for wasting
Just dick is placed in the slit no type of conversation
And prime rib from LaFrieda carved at the blablablabla
Fuck, fucked my last word up cause I don't give a shit man
I meant to say prime rib carved at the fucking carving station but yo

Yo my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
Plus she wearing a wedding dress a special day
She said she finally met a… Fuck
Yo, my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
And she wearing a wedding dress, a special day
She said she finally met a man to take her breath away
Well naturally I'm jealous, because I'm lonely
At times my only friends in life are drugs and the cannoli
My dad was right I shoulda listened when he told me
A walking contradiction wounds inflicted on me solely
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean-Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh yo
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean avenue, the family straight from Kosovo
That was years ago mum look how your son has bloomed
I hum a tune and then I'm hotter than the sun in June
And I'm just living my life but feel I'm drifting
Demons on the doorstep, lungs that feel constricted
Or maybe I should see a shrink and get prescripted
Or take the hand of God but shit I think i'll keep my distance
I think I'm frightened and I didn't even know it
But yo, that was a thought and I'm subconsciously a poet
It's perfect timing and I hope that I don't blow it
I pop the bottle of the moet, yo here's to me


Late nights I'm trying to stay up out of the orange skips
Great white sharks, the .38 with tarnished tip
27 years I never met an honest bitch
Slice their faces like Kitana and shit
Through my nasal blow the smoke
Basil on the boat
Hookers on the half shell, hundred dollar pants
Wind breaker jacket flapping like a falcon from a westward wind
Play the kitchen like a mexican, next of kin
Patrick Swayze… We out!
Better slow down baby
I’m out here wildin'
Better slow down baby
Shit is crazy

You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my home town, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby

Shit on my chest, shoot colors like a care bear
All year see me tan, hopping out the van
You wasn’t there, now you tryna show face
Fuck around, be a cold case
Chrome skates on an old day
Remote control chains, promote dough for the veins
Poke chicks, hoes with vogue legs
Eat steaks off a gold plate, stoned, listening to Coldplay


Long knife by the spinal, built like a rhino
Push the 635 to the finals
Pearl white like what you sniffin’ in your sinus
The finest vaginas demolished by my dick
One year from Queens to the top
Cream of the crop, serve a fiend out my sock
Five minutes till they lean like the drop
Now they spinning through the furnace like the scene from The Rock
Hide spinach like a doomsday prepper
Every Sunday in my Tuesday leather
Now my beard look like Uday and Qusay
Play the pool on a cool day


A lot of people with their hands out now
Got these motherfuckers mad ‘cause I’mma stand out now
You never let the hammer off, you got the soft hands
I hear you singing for the boss man, dog
I’m from a lost land, spill coke on the heater
Drop a little sauce on the beater
Zero to 60 in a Porsche like a cheetah
New York, I'm like Jeter, light Caesar
No hypebeaster, rock a nice sneaker
You get drugs for a good price
My price cheaper, guaranteed
My trunk snapping like a tambourine
Bodying these pussies with a camera team
Uh! You better slow down, baby
Uh! You better slow down, baby
Uh! You better slow down, baby
You better slow down, baby


You need to slow down baby
I'm a hero in my home town, baby
Bam Bam
La musica de Harry Fraud

White leather to the knee, we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from Flushing man, we known for using chopsticks
Problems getting dealt with, never pop shit
Hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with that dropkick, Marty Jannetty

Rock this Shawn Kemp, kamikaze
Burning cheese, Saganaki (opa)
Greek shit, whole team sick
Hoe bitches from Cleveland on my dick because I rap
Fuck it, make it clap
Throw the money in the air then pick it up
I'll take that back, bitch
Homie hold me down
Homie throw me phony pounds
The scent of dollars like some crispy garlic golden brown
Addicted but ain't nothing prescripted
Baby clams from Montauk, mix it up with the linguistics
Bitch I'm high

White leather to the knee, we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from Flushing man, we known for using chopsticks
Problems getting dealt with, never pop shit

Uh, know I hit you with that hot shit
Straight up off the block, roll up pot shit
Niggas just don't wanna go to school
Act like they are, but they not sick
Money all up in my pocket, putting diamonds in everything
See me out I look rich as fuck, clothes smelling like Mary Jane
Ride coastal been on every plane
Say these guys close, but these guys loco
When they see me they non-vocal
High as fuck I need bifocals
Kush got me moving slo-mo
Steak and eggs in my dojo
It's some Gs in there
Need some weed? I'm there
All these cars I own, ain't no keys in there
Tapping young niggas out, rolling weed out an ounce
Now I got a bigger crib
Repping what I live about
My hair long, my weed strong, so they staring
My weed strong, my money long, I ain't caring

White leather to the knee, we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from Flushing man, we known for using chopsticks

Don't hurt me again

Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again, baby
Nah

What up, love? I need a hug cause drugs be takin' over
Shorty couldn't take it no more, she went loca
No stranger to a rum and soda
I met the ho while she was slumped over
Shit, I've been good, though, I can't complain
I could probably cop a half a plane
Drinking juice just like Jack LaLanne now
I'mma strike it rich any day now
Uh, you know I gotta get a plate now
Virtuoso on a keyboard
I rep the eastern seaboard, jeez Lord
Please leave the Z3 keys before you leave
Don't sneeze on my shit, cause for shiz I'mma flip ya
Pedicured foot slide in the slipper
Tryna do the remix with Pitbull
Tell the pilot land at Schiphol
Play the violin with dimples
Life's ironic and it's simple
Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink
Drive nice car, wear all green mink
First time I whacked off was a Penthouse
Roses in the bath at the penthouse
Billy Joel at the garden
Should I get a skybox or an '89 IROC?
It's always poppin' at the IHOP
Choke a pussy with his tie knot, it's my block
Chuck Knoblauch, spicy coconut curry from the Thai spot
I'm in a hurry, dumb jewelry
The verdict read from a hung jury
The doctor said that I was hung early
Skull curly, Larry, and Moe, I'll marry a ho
Only if the bitch look like Mari' Monroe
Twisted off the Jenkem, watching Iron Chef
The secret ingredient was lion's neck
Royal Blue-Cyber Tech
I ride solo like a fighter jet
Hurt me again

No, don't hurt me again
Please, don't hurt me again
No, don't hurt me again
There's no hit records on a demo
There's no hit records on a demo
No, don't hurt me again

What you think
Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna-
I ain't like that one
Yo, line for line
Straight up lambs on the arm, Giambi lenses
Ken Caminiti, Bosworth

Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna, Lo designer
Bending these young Lola Fellanas over. Ace the test
Baste the breast with the juices
Under the influence of fly shit, I glide like Ovechkin
Disqus hoody, puff hibiscus, balance be the crispest
Baby girl, you're wylin if you sniff this
You gotta take a piss test, piss right through your fishnets
Robert Moses State Park, lamb in the sand
Blam blam a piggie try to put my fam in the can
Strictly cop and go's, until we laid in the Galapagos
Eating tacos, higher than a opera note
We never ride Civics, the Mont Blanc scripted lyrics
It's like avant garde to the critics
I throw you in that armbar with the quickness
Either you with me or bitch you on the shit list

Bitch, please, picture me in Sicily
The hard bottoms gators is slippery
I just had an epiphany
And now I'm shittin' on your whole steez ridiculously
45. fire at ya attire, to break your armor up like fine china
Fly designer hoes diggin for gold like a 49er
I hit the diner, the Carolina
Pass the lighter to the passenger in the spyder
Vagina splash like apple cider
So fuck your little 2 cents blue benz bitches jump like Harold Miner
I'm in the recliner, we traced like eye liner
And I escape like MacGyver
Bank robbers, bang 38's to taste cobbler
And lay up with a case of vodka
Get cake and prosper
Ate steak and lobster to Frank Sinatra
Air you out, leave your face for pasta
Get laced and dip the jakes in the grey Boxster
Beige fox, 88 Clarks
Ladies identify gangsters' posture
I'm feeling like J Hoffa
Fuck yall, eat a fat dick with the monster
Uh
Waxy
Smoking that Barbara Walters wax
Same fucking outfit twenty days in a row I don’t give a shit

You only came around ‘cause you thought I had some money for you
You got it fucked up
That’s for the kids
And If there’s anything left I’ll cop a crib
And If there’s anything left after that I’ll cop a six
How you think I got the art displayed on the dinner plates?
First course was from the Finger Lakes
Last course cinnamon ginger cake
She gave me head during the Laker game
I got her tatted, trying to erase her name
No, I caught her cheating, her pussy didn’t feel the same
She was probably with one of the Broncos
Or LeBron so I blew her car up
Soon as she try to start it up, nah
I can’t talk about that though…
Your chance is thin like the moustache of Puerto Ricans
Shooting guns with my daughter on the weekend
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker *laughs
Fuck
Fuck man
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Uh

Told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Hit him with stacks
Showed him the gat like ‘you gonna miss the finger roll right’
Fuck
I Told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat

Then I cartwheeled into a aqua car

*trails into laughter
Shit!

Yo

I told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Showed him some stacks
Then showed him the gat like ‘you're gonna miss the finger roll right?’
Yes, Mr. Baklava
Then I cartwheeled into and aqua car
Now I’m, sliding
Ma, your boy has made it, no more
Crying
The facial reminiscent of a lion
Fuck around I’ll send you back to zion
And I ain't even trying
Swing the wood wheel like lumberjacks
I remember back when they wouldn’t spend a stack on my rap
Now they want to wipe my ass in the crack after I shat
And I just had corn beef hash
Ew…

Yeah
It’s me
Motherfucking Big Body

Eagles up
We've been the best since I stepped in
Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack, break her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin
Tree to make the head spin
Every season play the corner like I'm Revis
Light Caesar, heavy bearded like I'm Jesus
New York City, Queens borough be the backdrop
I bring it back to all the benches, need a blacktop
Big things, see me moving like a Sasquatch
Money, I'm in pursuit, cuchillo inside the boot
Bitches are on display, give brain inside the coupe
Shift gears, that's with the left
Which means I'm on the right, get paid
By any means, you hold it, say goodnight kid
Two fingers hold the potion when I'm smoking
Slow motion, snatch a snapper out the ocean
In my lungs go the drugs like the red chief
Red leaf lettuce blood money on the bench seat
12 courses laid up on the long table
Aged wine got me spinning like a dreidel
For fly women use a condom cause it's fatal
Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil
The red razor cut the features in your facial
Creep in Corona, bumping Fernando Villalona
Puffing cheeba in the street by the chimi corner
Tu ne tappa me, muthafuckas are sloppy
Captain of the rap, you talking to papi
Up in Niagara Falls, make your wifey suck a
Bag of balls, it's sick, just like a Magic cough
Same person on camera or when the muthafuckin' camera off
Hash straight from the desert, can knock
A camel off, Sheep straight out of school
Let the hammers off. Off the boat shit
Whole cliques roll thick, no shit
Piss drunk and they smoke sticks
Not a word of English but
They hold the four-fifths
FILA jumpsuit, sandals, the whole shit
Young kids walking around, got the Desi in hand
Going "Boom Shakalaka!" like it's NBA Jam
Never speak to fuzz
Tap out the reefer, show him how
To use his sneakers, cuz
Roasted peppers, sweet tomatoes, heirloom
We on the beach, fresh Ceviche
We in Cancun, fly girly curly
Hair is getting read through
We in the shower give me head: shampoo
Swimming trunk, shoe accentuate the ankle
Eyes blue, put the children's money in the Banco
Giuseppe Franco, take the cash and tango
I'm straight stoned -sly, thank you
Bye, peace, one, fuck you
Yeah, fucking throw up on the floor, shit
Get the cleaning lady
My bad! Hey yo!

In only one year, considered as a veteran
Top of the line, the whip look like tropical lime
Off the boat, cousin, Glock by the spine
Do a murder seven thirty, then they flying at nine
Shit!
Handspring half twist into the Buick
You say you’re doing shit but never do it
I say I’m doing shit and then I do it
Never going back to work in labor
Fuck that your little chain, you better tuck that
Uh, vultures flying over the carcass
Bitches blowing on my dick like a cartridge
Throw some grass up, aim a little east of the target
My brain was sculpted at Harvard
Never mention all the crime I been a part of
Serve like Ivan Lendl up in the rental
The cheese been assembled
They receiving health benefits and dental
The lamb was laced with fennel
Left hand then shift the right foot touched the pedal!

From now on I'm just the symbol
Hundred dollar drugs smoke out the window
Paper plates, I never had a license
Could always catch me smoking spices
Triple lindy out the Jeep, land into a split
Get up in the spin, doggie, I’m the shit!
You’re staying broke, like Maury with the hip
Huh, catch me on Maury with my bitch
Fuck with me!

The whip gymnast
Jump out the car into the river
Don't splash on the dive
Straightforward money, cash on the side
If you catch him I want that bastard alive
My bitch's ass is like an apple
You bitches see me look astonished
Your boy is ill with the phonics
Since Gary Payton had the pill for the Sonics
You’re still a novice
And to be brutally honest, your shit is garbage!
Dog, I've been a scholar
My shoes are still alive from Lake Victoria
Fuck the order up, leave you stretched in the corridor
I got my aura up, hoes that drive me in foreign truck (dykes)
One is riding me, the other one is rolling up (weed)
Pray to science they don’t pull me over
If they do, then the fun is over
Whether young or older, motherfucker's been a musket holder
Just sprinkle cheese on top of me, and let it get crusted over!

Fuck with me! (repeated throughout)
Fucking drug shit
Do the drugs
Yeah
Yo

Straight from the depths of Queens.
Leave you sleeping on the mezzanine
Like you Lincoln, then switch into a desert scene
Often heard, but this motherfucker seldom seen
I'm throwing blows while you waiting for the bell to ring
Drug smoking
Raisins make the pasta sweet
Slumped over when the barrel and your posture meet
Stay lean like some motherfucking ostrich meat
You full of shit it's time to get a colonoscopy
Scissor kicks, dick suck from Miss Elizabeth
Lex Luger arms
4 in the morning in the dark with the computer on
Wasting my time, my thoughts are paced, untastable grace replaced in my mind
Born to shine like the eyes on a cat
Same cat fuck around, put the knife in your back
This is nothing, we live & let die and roam the land
And you bluffing
You lifted the cards and showed your hand pussy

Tailor-made rubber, Rubbermaid reliable
Never spill the soup
Rock a linen suit
Play the streets like the ball court
Spin & shoot
Strong as Popeye dipping in the spinach too

Take my nuts out your mouth
Let me breathe for a minute please
Your life is cheap like a hooker in the Philippines
About to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens
You're on the shelf like a figurine
Drugs infested my mind
But I'm destined to shine
Spit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind
Thousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine
Live divine, free the mind, lead the blind, read the signs
Hands up like you stepping in the party
No you getting robbed, motherfucker, with the shotty
Said you pottyd
Make your body do an ollie
Then dig your shorty out cuz I geeked her up on molly
Have her eating dick, no need for seasoning
If seven dudes are in the room then she's pleasing them
Like a trooper. Hit her in the pooper. Throw her in the shower
Then I take her out to Lupa
I'm kinky, I'll hit it even if it's stinky
Put em in the shower, make the pussy brand new
Ran through. Give 'em money what I can't do
Stuff her lunchbox & burn her with the candle

UH!
Consensual Rape
Vinegar solutions
Animal abusing
Barrel revolutions
Don't get me pissed off, fuck around rip your tits off
Still getting head, even if my dick's soft
Rising quick, no Fleischman's
I'm in the endzone with one leg up, posing like Heisman
Throwing like Theismann, sway foot
With the Village Leader smoking a pipe with seven wise-men
I eat the biggest piece of chicken at the table
Let 'em know I'm hungry
Polo on the rugby
The forty-four long surely got a trusty home
Trying to live American Dreams...Dusty Rhodes
Yeah
Fucking Pussy
Get it together Justin, got to get it together fam
Let's go

Yeah, fuck the back talk
Save all that pussy shit for the cat walk
Now write your name 100 times on the blackboard
Just a white man excelling in a Black sport, like I'm Pistol Pete
You already know you a goner when I kiss your cheek
Lift your feet, like when your sister sweeps
Fine dining, drink water out the crystal creek
Straight from Queens rocking leathers like I'm Mr. Cheeks
(Uhhhh, fly shit
Grown man shit
Do it one more time, fuck it
I'm good to go)

Yo, I'm a wild freak, hit shorty where the child sleep
While her mother make soup with the cow feet
Shoulder pads and a leather, Beau Brummell
Hopping out the limo at the old Tunnel
Fuck sex on the beach, I want head in the streets
Spread bed on the feet
Lead on your cheek, the cadillac from 73
Aqua marine with a popular fiend, uhh
Big Bird, Farrington alumnus
Mouth like a pussy, she gum dick

You see me in the green velour, facial conquistador
Then I order up a feast for four
If you see me in a leather, know it's reaching the floor
Linen flapping in the wind cause of the breezy shore, yeah
Spinal tap, you spitting gynecology rap
Eat your pussy with a plastic bag, covering that
Brothers will clap leave you hovered or jacked
If there's chicken in the building, know I'm smothering that
This tool I got will loosen up your stool a lot
Near the pee pee will make you poo-poo a lot
In the Z3 bumping U2
(Yo this Big Motherfucking Body, bitch)

Ginger ale laying in a Knicks cup
Pay thirty dollars for a dick suck
Pay a hundred dollars for the joints I rolled
Oyster bowls chilling in the cloisters
I love Black girls boisterous
Shorty's on the arm like a koi fish
On a herby white dude with the yellow fever
Yellow sneakers, see through yellow beeper
(Feel the beat...)

Banging seven gram rocks and finishing them
Because that’s how I roll, I have one speed, I have one gear

When our eyes first met was like the fourth day in July
When you kissed my lips, I knew one day you'd be mine

Watch my shorty take a shower, I want the good loving
Six ducks in a wood burning oven
Georgia Southern, her alma mater
She raised out in Queens, but moved out to Colorado
Looney Tunes, Taz on the shirt
Fuck swag, got pizzazz
Two jags, Cincinnati Zubaz
Du rag, Bay Terrace pool pass
Talked to Skip, schooled me on the ponies
Next year catch me posing at the Tonys
Folding paper wilding at the OTB
Grow the money like a Cocha tree

American flags hang on walls that hide money
Put my arm through the Picasso
Kept a fortress, crib got the Tex-Mex motif, wolves howling
Two stallions pull the buggy, Clydesdale
Crack the Bud, guzzle, humidors
Uncle Moozy with the Mitsubishi
Uncle Jimmy with the funny money flossing out in AC
Randy Quaid with the turtleneck
Erma with the jungle juice, man feet
Beamer, tan seats
Smack the taco out your mouth, green couch
Sittin' first class, feelin' like shit though
Starin' out the window with the mind of a schizo
Thinkin' if I jump, will I feel it when I hit the ground?
Fuck that, I want the crown off anybody head
I wouldn't care if everybody's dead
It's why I keep the pump shotty layin' in the bed
Have a fuckin' sleepover with my weapons
My Rambo knife is eatin' nuggets with my Smith & Wesson
Shit, I made this out of nothin'
Damn, these ladies love me out in London
Laurenivici served the granulated onion
My mind is locked in a contaminated dungeon
Dog, what the fuck is with your mother?
She got one leg longer than the other
One eye through the shutter
Made the transition from weed to butter, like spring to summer

I nearly lost my mind
All a motherfucker got is time, time, time
Time, time
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so glad
I nearly lost my mind
All a motherfucker got is time, time, time
Time, time
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so glad
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so glad
Aw man
Smoking in that rocking chair
Ah

My past life I was a Rabbi
Now I live the fast life
Drugs on standby in the circle by the campfire
Telling stories of yesteryear
Pull out the pocket mirror just to check my hair
Hit it with the comb again
The rap Dennis the Menace with Dennis Rodman's in Venice, inventive
She took a bump and started dancing like Elaine Benes
The big chain sway like I’m playing tennis
One man team, about to win the pennant
Now you can tell by my pendant that I’m protected
Direct descendent in the blue and orange Lexus watching ‘Se7en'
Land in Dublin
Pull me in the room and ask if its resin
I said no they sent me on my way with blessings

I trained a dolphin to let the slammer off like Dolph Lundgren
That’s if your mouth running
You’ll get your cow something
I’m rare like a fucking Asian playing hockey
My ocean view is due to Papi
Bitches call me Rodney
Bought my bitch a present hope I don’t spoil it
‘What is it baby?’
Face to face toilets
Toyota with the spoiler Ace of Base boiling
I play ball like Billy Hoyle
Now I need a Sidney Dean to help me start this brothel in the Philippines
I stay in Flushing like I’m Dillon Gee
You ain't gotta open up the comic book to figure who the villain be
It’s me doing perfect dives in the Sicilian sea
You know I like my bitch with a Brazilian V
Bumping Bobby Brown
Cry when I’m not around
She always hold it down pound under the seat
In that all white Jeep
Sleep, that’s if you wanna
I be schwitzing in the sauna
Its better than the piggys blitzing on the corner
Come in the crib every night, and I kiss my daughter
Same lips spit on the lawyer
*spitting noise

We out
Its me
Always
Forever
Baby my ride so clean, I ride so dirty
I'm about to buy an alligator for my birthday
My girl asking me, "Where you been?", don't worry
She said, "Baby I crashed the Benz", don't worry
I ride so clean, my ride so dirty
I'm about to buy a fucking Lion for my birthday
My girl asking me, "Where I been?" don't worry
She said, "Baby, I crashed the Benz", don't worry

Dropkicks out the drop-top 6
Don't make your fucking kid become a hostage, I got this
Stay in the water like the Loch Ness
Shirtless rocking a locket
Drugs in my pocket
It's all for a profit
Aim it and pop it, drive in a range in my boxers
Lay in the tropics, my girl pussy red like a lobster
Orgies at Hofstra
My bank account is like a Polish doctor
My heart is cold, I sing a soldiers opera
My drugs as strong as Arnold
They found her dead in the gold Impala
Hanging backwards out the chopper
The room smell like Nag Champa
Most my crew a bunch of armed robbers


Yeah, I rhyme sick like I play with shit
I've driven every flavored whip there is to get
Feel like I dip that cigarette in wet stuff
I should be on that Sped Ed bus, layin' on the bed with a red head slut
These mother fuckers praying that I don't make it
I'm on the balcony stoned and naked playing Sega
Prince of Albania
No money, nothing to say to ya
I push the limo to the stadium
Game 7, Knicks-Heat
Me and Spike had to switch seats
Cause he kept spilling Henny all on my bitch feet
Expensive bracelets where my forearms and my fists meet
Down in Mexico eating chilis


No emotions, lotions on the bed sheets
I saw her walking cause I'm stalking on the dead streets
Trying to purchase where the shoulders and the head meet
She had a tight pink dress, her pussy was a weapon
Said she was a daughter of a Reverend
Well, thank god I don't believe in heaven
Butt cheeks sculpted like a horse's hind
Shit man, I think that I just crossed the line
Annual abortion time
Yeah, she got the tat straight from West 4th
Hereditary cancer almost took her breast off
And over 6 months she said she had a chest cough
Well I'm not a doctor, but I know that's not a good sign
Matter of time 'til she placed and laced in a wood pine
For years she was the hood slime
Now no longer having a good time
Under earth, she burst into a sudden birth
Oh shit, the facial of my cousin Murph
Strange occurrences, alignment with the sun and earth, yeah
As baby turtles break the sand just to figure out the meaning
Instinctively they heading towards the water cause they need it
Forever cycles stay the same, they feel it like a fiend's wrist
Mustard straight from Russia that they brought in on a steam ship
My mustache like a Colonel
Take a haters facial and I treat it like a urinal
A bit disturbed, confessions in a journal
I'm sickened by my thoughts so it's tossed in the inferno
Statik Selektah
Playing through the broken ankles, man
Never sit down, cause I'mma stand up

Book a ticket to the tropics cause I’m through with all the shit
That I'm living every day, in the mirror saying why me?
Hide my eyes cause I'm sickened with the image
Of using marijuana, sipping vintage for the time being
My skills set is very serious, in fact
Spit a wild rap, carve a steak right off the cow's back
Throw it on the grill, I'm cooking in a suit
Same shit that's on the grill gave me leather for the boot
If they make me take the stand then I'm lying through my teeth though
Ask to swear to God but in that I don't believe though
My man Stevie Mo playing safety for Toledo
Hustle 'til my fingers staying cheesy like a cheeto
Shorty on the bed pleasuring my pee pee
Smart crew TCN, lyrical graffiti
Drug roll precise, like a hooker with the dice
Butcher with the knife, you get tooken for your life
So much to say it's so little time and shitty
Killer Queens the borough, New York be the city
Coming crazy out your mouth will get your split up like a philly
Running through the maze like I'm Willie, you gotta feel me

I’m moving forward cause nothing's gonna be the same
Eyes blurry from the smoke, I can't see the lane
Swerving heavy, bottle in my lap
I'm looking for a problem so I'm modeling the gat
Somebody save me, cause I don't wanna go to jail
I'd rather be up in the mansion for the polo sale
But I'm here, stuck inside my thoughts
I'm tryna have a bag of money stuffed inside my shorts

My life is like a movie, Blizzard with the shottie
Hookah house on Roosie chilling in the lobby
Yes I'm living gnarly, the 40 ounce of Barley
Open up cigars and fill 'em with a bunch of Marley
Double cut porterhouse straight from Luger's
Ruger for intruders hand to hand made by the duelers
Ginger ale in Knicks glasses, your style is piss mothafucka
Time to flip the mattress, kick it swift as Cassius
My mind is stronger than Mariusz Pudzianows
Obvious to see I'm a star straight off the couch
You rapping with a blouse, you get slapped up side the mouth
By the Zangief look-a-like, Bronson always cooking right
Spray the vinegar to tighten up a yummy
Smoking got me squinting like the sky is high and sunny
Attachment on the nozzle make the iron fire funny
Never stop until my body diving in a pile of money


I'm always smoking like a gunshot
You know the fuzzy light green, call it Dunlop, flow nun's twat
Many hours, one man standing, one spot
From the morning to the mothafuckin' sun drop
Cause I'm one with the Earth, eyes red
Mothafucka I've been blunted since birth, age 9
Mom dukes kept the gun in the purse, next to the hair spray
Fuck tomorrow, money coming in the fast way
I think I got 15...bullshit, this is nothing. Look, my feet hurt, I need DOPE. What are we gonna do Sebastian, cause I got, I need piles of money. Forget this shit...but a hit of crack will do for now

Yeah...through the eyes of a G
Through the eyes of a G, see me in the all white Eclipse
A husband pay me 10 stacks to fuck his bitch
Hand up her ass like a Muppet baby, it's crazy
While she do a buck-eighty in a mustard Mercedes
I move the mustard from Russia to Haiti
Forty-fives will kiss your neck like the touch from a lady
Fuck with my lunch and then the pump leaves you under the daisies
You know your bitch is just another cocksucker with rabies
I'm signing autographs in Spanish, I live with Michael Jackson's anguish
Hop in the Vanquish and vanish off the manor in a strange manner
Aim the hammer at your dame's bladder, like it ain't matter
I smoke 'til I got down syndrome
Tan gators, brown linen
Multi-color money, seven different kinds of cheeses
My silhouette resembles Jesus in all seasons
Take a ginger shot, doing concentration curls with the cinderblocks
Doing squats, hope the ox don't drop out
Don't make me have to slap the fire out your pop's mouth
It's me...uh
Through the eyes of a G

Yo
Through the eyes of a G
A-B, utilize what you and I use to see
To move forward
Cause I get bored with niggas talking 'bout
Who they used to be, what they used to do
My homie headed to court, not for a 2-on-2
Ironically, I'll have you know we do it for the sport
Or at least to keep a little gold in this uniform
I'm abnormal like a unicorn that you could get on
Cows jump over moons when my nouns and verbs move
Etiquette of a veteran, still getting checks
You get a F for your efforts, we never trade techs
I tried to keep the peace but now I gotta keep the piece
I speak in synchronistic frequency with triggers squeezing
And one day I'll drop to my knee and repent to Jesus
'Til then I'm humping my lust demons for no reason
Soul-o ho, from Del Amo to SoHo, ho
Yo, yo, check, "you do not know me, no, no, no
You do not know me but I know you-"
I had to, I had to do it
{Know you broke my heart woman}
{When you said goodbye to me}
You say goodbye to me bitch, you better break North
Before you six South and I'll be sitting in that big house

Just let me sharpen my knives, thrown on the apron
X's mark the steak and the salad crumbled with bacon
And bleu cheese, caramel complexion's on two knees
Or two skis, carving up the Alps is what this dude needs
I'm Rick the Model, Martel to cartel
Live fast and eat the big tuna like Billy Parcells
No more child's play kid you with the big boys
Fuck an economy size, we want that big Royce
My family's sayin' that I rhyme with fury
Only focus on them hundred bill faces and suitcases
That'll bribe a jury, grind the curry never shine the jewelry
Pussy like an eighty-six style, you know it's fine and furry
Spark the bark in the park, you know, lumberyard
You ain't never in the limelight, undercard
Bronsolini in the sky, thunder rod
Commandante of this rap shit, your Mossad, killer


The second stanza even deadly than the first
From the birth, I've been enlisted to plant seeds in the earth
That's soon road to a valley that feeds, civilization
I'm walking the torrid land though I'm seeking my vindication from
My bad, I'll keep it fifth grade, keep the switchblade
Hilfiger sailin' apparel and plus a crisp fade
First day class, the Agassis are black and white
My older cousin puffing pot bitch, pass the pipe
Now I'm a certified user, more like abuser
Slice and dice the music I'm fluid like the yakuza
I'm Sanders whether Deion or Barry, find candy
Though I smoke until my eyes are the shape of Tia Carrere
My team we work as a unit, nobody hide the ball up
Great intuition and vision, no time to hit the mall up
Just a taste of the life like a September call up
Johnnie Walker in our tall cup, getting torn up
Listen - I'm steel fisted with the iron lung
Heavy metal ballads out the guitar with lion's run
Praise the son that can stand on his own two
Smoke on the big blunt, take a sip of this home-brew
[Hook}
She had the sweetest scent I ever smelt a woman have
Skin would glisten like reflections off the blueish Jag
She had a Jewish dad, and a Jamaican maid
Started hanging with strippers and dropping the zippers
And selling the pussy for paper to play
Crusty feet like she hiking for days and live in the mountains
At the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the Michigan towel
She quick to split up an owl
She loves some dick in her bowels
Dabble in crystal, polish the pistol, powder her sniffles with flour
Straight flieshman
In the private part of her pussy pocket
Randomly pussy farting
Sold at the hookers auction
Left as a crooked orphan
Wrapped in the sports section
Box score, fake black rubber cock in the top drawer, what

Make this fucking bitch sit in vinegar
Apple cider baths
Sit in the vinegar
Bronsolino
PS

Yo, so many unfamiliar faces that have come and gone
You're a constant, fucked you in the school closet
We were young then, experimental periods
Laid a towel cause I fucked you on your period
Stole my mothers car crashed it by the Burger King
Young love, but we thought it was eternity
Raw sex – never thought about paternity
But now this cunt is trying to murder me
Abusing me physically and verbally
Said my dick was too small
I went and got the surgery, just to show it off
This ain't real shit, baby, I'm just going off
Clear the mind, fuck it, so I wrote a song
Night life, I'm destined for the bright lights
Knife fights at the bar with some white dykes
She hold me down, break a bottle on the bitch head
.25 out the pussy and it spits lead
We always end up in a situation
She throwing diapers out the window at me
Called the cops said I beat her face
Beat the case, now I shiver at a sweet embrace

I rap now, bitches sucking like a vacuum
On the bed, stay bent like a smack spoon
Bubble butt thicker than the double dutch
In the van, leave her tied up in bumblefuck

Cold, tired and I mean it
I thought we'd grow to old farts in Phoenix
Well now you see me 'lo scarves and a ski knit
But I've been here since the beginning, like a prefix
But I'mma to do what I gotta do
Trying to make this french dough like a Pâte à Choux
Over your head, after sex shorty hold me in bed
Smoking Ethiopian red
The son goes, a single teardrop fallopians bled
Nowadays you catch the hooker sniffing coke in the shed
It's a damn shame I'm just chilling eating lamb brain
I keep the weiner on display for the campaign

I'm just doing what I had to do
Tryna Drop me in the ground but I'm not going
To the top till I fall just like Owen
Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak
Bronsolino
Fuck that sitting-down rap type shit, man
I stand up, cause I'm a motherfucking man
And I'm motherfucking hot

Peep it
I'm on the third floor, your class was in the basement
You know what that means; you got a hint of retardation
Well, me too, I'm fully-blown just like the flow, though
Spit the silky shit that's ankle-length like a kimono
Uh, sharp instruments to rock like a fossil
Shotty for the haters, that's trimmed off at the nostrils
Well, me and Docker eating dinner at the brothel
Never sniff that blanco, that's word to OJ's Bronco
Cop a Dutch and break it open, overfill it
I'm rollin' in the car, it may be shaky, never spill it, though
Cause when I rhyme, I feel possessed by El Espirito
Encounters of a Third Kind, X-Rays on the visual
Ginger ale and hot sauce, two things I live by
I'm such a chill guy, but fuck around and, yes, you will die
Green DeVille, right, green drugs, but hold the serum
Rub the things together, then you clear 'em, flatline
The prosciutto, olives from Tunisia
Drums are hittin' hard because they chopped up like a cleaver
And yes I'm smokin' all the reefer
The night creeper
I love the pussy really tight, that's with a light Caesar
Can it be that I'm the Golden Child, the chosen one
The piggies saying freeze, but every time they did I chose to run
Takin' that attachment on the nozzle like a soldier's gun
Hide behind the boulder, silver bullet through you shoulder, son
Crack the pepper over thin crust that's handmade
I'm stayin' strapped just like the Air Raid
Yo, take a taste of my nuts
Know they sweet just like the candy
Dick is the same color as Band-Aid, understand me?
I built this building, they came and then I conquered
Two hour flights to Heathrow up in the Concorde
Fermented grapes up in my glass that bear the same name
I'm working hard because that's what I need to maintain
Killer Queens is on the rise, so understand me
Ain't never stoppin' 'til there's a Grammy in a room for my family
Also known as a den
Post and toast with Lauren
Posing for pictures, kicking scriptures that form up a phlegm

Uh, let me take a little break fam
I'm fucking straight out of surgery, man
I need a little break
When I come back in, I'mma come back in hard, though
I promise you that
(Look at my motherfucking shoulders, son)

Yo
I'm diving in like Louganis
I'm aiming right for that anus
Trying to give her a payment to rent the pussy like Avis
Peace to Shaevitz & Shaevitz
My rhymes are seasoned for flavor
Fuck with shorties that's in shape, they got the V like they're Vader
Ah ha, Animal Style, flippin' like a flipjack
You heard the cat rap, like animal's fear from a rat, got
Ankle length, that's suede, the jacket
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
Do the Chatatimmy Shimmy like a crackhead
No one compare to me, lampin' with my tangerine
I'm fiend out, so I'm bangin' on the tambourine
Yo, bring the drugs and call me when you on the corner
And I'mma send the doja down in case they run up on ya
Your style is celibate, I'm elegant, trust
My style is liver and I'm ivory like a elephant tusk
Swirl the wine inside the glass that got the delicate musk
Shoe be pointy at the toe, closin' down the show
Poison be the flow, got the boysenberry blow
Finish on the women
That mean the bitch from Finland
Her tits are bonkers
Chilling in her chanclas
Rollers in her hair, I'm running through it, Larry Csonka

Bronsolino
You don't even know who fucking Larry Csonka is, man
Get the fuck off my wee-wee
Pussy
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
(I needed a little taste to that)

Twisting joints like a contortionist
Laid in the Porsche
My father driving
Days been sunny since I started rhyming
No denying me; I'm known to keep a fresh foot like podiatry
Nobody high as me
Green Timbs, in Vegas I'm like Steve Wynn
At the same time, fellatio from three twins
Those are triplets; I've been wilding since the Rabbi snipped it
Then they laughed, and ate brisket, fuck!
On my behalf, he had a meeting at the Neptune
Had little daddy hide the heater in the restroom
Guns drawn like my bath by my lady friend
Mesothelioma money: drop Mercedes-Benz
And I ain't never left, you know I'm still here
Spit the shit to bring a cripple out the wheelchair
Bite a bitch like George Whipple in the stair case
Long as she got big nipples and a tan face

Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
(Yeah, you're in the concrete right now)
Devil is on the loose, no coop

Foul living like Sandusky and Paterno
I've been husky, motherfuckers couldn't touch me
'Lo rugby with an Asian model so ugly
Celebration 1987, no bubbly
Facially, I'm like a young John Kennedy
More obscenity; EBT in Genovese
Go to Ock, get 70 for 100
I want the 75 from Ocky but he fronted
Take the money, cop 5 dimes, 2 chicken sandwiches, 9 limes
For the Canada Dry; pose for the cameras by the banister, "Hi"
In the summer, rock the vest set – Salmon Kani
Flex the three-quarter cream Fi's
We're summer seam G's; steamed red snapper – Vietnamese
Catch a case, get a Jewish lawyer, beat it with cheese
Fuck the beef cause it don't go together, read em and weep
It's very easy, make you disappear now, kid
Make your paper, but you need to stay grounded
Eyes wide like a chick that got the dick in the butt
We're out here, trying to get the money, baby, live it up

Talk about me if you please, but I must be Hercules
Hercules
I must be Hercules!
Yeah
So give me that reason
I told you I loved you already, bitch, what the fuck?
Yeah
Shawl neck on the drunk lawyer
Coke shits in the toilet
Turkey sandwich in aluminium foil
The game been fixed
I don’t play that shit
I aim that shit
If she looking at another mother fucker than you leave that bitch
I don’t play that shit
Hear me
Left hand is steering
In a Amadu Diablo
Shit I got the urge to get a earring
Image in the rearview mirror like Timothy Leary
Don’t even come near me
I keep it thug with a gun near me
Your boy been eating on the run clearly
Clear the run-way
720’s on a one way
So much drugs, what would a nun say?
And its Sunday
Shit, I don’t really give a fuck
All I really want to do is see my people up
Up to no good again
She threw the condom told me put it in
I did, fuck
I nutted in like three strokes
Shit, now that’s no way to rep the East Coast
Every day I’m walking with my head up
Don’t let up ‘cause it’s a set-up
Like Albanian marriage go from Haiti to Paris
The bath was 90 degrees
Tapping Heinies with ease (shit,)
Bitch please I’m the bee’s knees
Shooting Deca-Durabolin three CC’s
Peep the landscape
You can catch me in the trees like the shit for the pancakes
Yo pass me the ball fool
You better fuckin' pick me, ya
Straight the fuck up, I roof this shit
Fuckin' 360 on this pussy
I don't give a fuck
I'll kick this motherfucking ball over the fence
No shoes on

I know you see me on the TV, lookin' like a hunk of beef
When I smile your baby mama shit her dungarees
Somebody get the kid a deal he sound like me
But nah, dunny don't get down like me
The falcon flies back to the glove when I whistle
Don't try to put me in the box like a tissue
Cause I push you in the box with a pink suit
Fuck around and have some squid ink soup, bitch
(Ah man there's so much fuckin' hash in this joint right now son)
Uh, you ain't a legend like Yanni
I'm so Queens like a Roy Wilkins T-shirt
With one arm shredded, and one arm missing
Dog, I was born with Allah's vision
I learned quick I couldn't follow suit
Cause the Devil put the pork inside the dollar soup
Now I'm sittin' in first class with a hard dick
Listenin' to German guitar riffs, what a life
I was made like the beginning of Jurassic Park
When they took the fucking blood from the mosquito with a dope needle
Then they shot it in a wild lion, 1983
I popped out holdin' an iron with a visor on
Yeah, uh huh
Yo, the videos are like a Jewish summer camp promo
Your ideas lack Adobo

Yo, silk cinder blocks, cinnamon socks
On the low like a whip without shocks
I bag bitches in flocks
Representative for everything official
Ya'll niggas can't live, so it's officially an issue
Waterproof penmanship, padded on a rugby
Hammer in the hamper 'case a nigga try to thug me
I'm a idol, my wave is tidal, forget survival
Treat the last record I broke just like a rival
Uh, I'm New York before it turned into a bike lane
Never had a light fame, split the pipe cane
It was written but I wrote it
Put religion right on my neck and then I froze it
Laurenovitch, yeah

3:36 in the morning
Location: a drug infested area, Brooklyn, New York
What am I doing? Standing on an unidentified corner
With a Latin individual, corn rows, foamposites;
All sorts of a felony in his waist
But who are you? She only loves me when I'm naked
That's right (sniff sniff)
Bam Bam in the mother fucking building
Queens, New York
Straight up
Drop that shit
It's me
I built this shit
Yeah

Let me begin baby, my name is Bronsoliño
All I see is C-notes, silk shirts at the casino
It's time to take those leather pants off, this ain't no dance off
I know your hands soft, you're on the menu like the lamb broth
This is a grown man's sport
And, dog, I leave a motherfucker laid out on the handball court
I never brag and boast, I'm fire out the dragon's nose
My words pronounced just like a camel toe
And every whip in the garage laced
Keep that thing in the guitar case, bait the cops into a car chase
Crash the mother fucking Jeep into the venue
You better pray to God it's straight to Heaven where they send you
Ah, why the fuck would I have a bodyguard
If I look just like the mother fucking bodyguard
Baby hair curls on my forehead, leave your whore dead
Hop out that four times, four door and draw lead
I'm underground and I need more bread
And I need more head from some bitches straight from Morehead
State your business cause I'm busy tanning naked
My joint is shaking while I'm wearing bracelets
Uh, your words are tasteless, your taste is basic
My taste in Asics will lead your fucking spaceship into Matrix
This place I made is quite spacious
And dog I'm not the one to fucking play with
Hear me?
Action

05' pounds in the Laredo, they gotta get there today though
Ain’t no time for tryna lay low, bay bro
If you can’t do it all you gotta do is say no
I’ll take it from there, Ace is on Grand ready to work it
Displayed a smirk like Mr. Perfect
Under the bridge, behind the van, in the cab, I made the drop off
Thank science that nothing popped off, since I was young, had a lust for foreign vehicles and things
My father wore the ring when he pushed me in the swing
Plus he pushed that red thing, I wanted to be like him so bad
Wear the same shoes that he stepped in, of course I need paper
I want to ride the one-seater like speed racer
In the Jetta smoking a one sheet in the green acres
Listening to bullshit music, thinking how I’m gonna do this

Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on

I’m from a place called the jungle where the living is rough
It had me low for a while now I’m picking it up
Holding the spot straight sticking it ripping it up
I dropped 99 problems, switching and not giving a fuck
So what you what you want? Got your bitch nigga gripping her butt
Her and my dick, taking pics nigga flicking it up
My click is wassup get buck if you want?
You end up dumped chump, in the pond lake in a truck in New York
There’s no ducking me, the Bada$$ time, but no fuckery
Won’t find a chick who got a dime or take a single buck from me
These hoes be loving me, I keep it so G
Respecting where I be nigga check your OG
My rap flow, imperial fad flows
Well here it go my, visions is linear when I’m ripping the video
It’s a lyrical miracle when I enter your stereo
The rarest breeds, sick like venereal diseases

Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on

Dying for nothing
Killing to live, fighting for something
Too bad we don’t know what it is
What you think all of this cash for?
Trying to put stamps on my passport
Man I’m just scheming on new hoes
I already forgot about my last broad

Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on
Here we are
Just us
I know you want from the first time you seen me in the movie
Hanging on the shoulder of a villain
She could flatten a village
You know I'm usually chilling out with Bruce Willis
Somehow, you and my man met first
I was still stealing the money outta my gram-gram's purse
But you were
Running the streets, letting the blam-blam work
Back then we smoked nickels of dirt
Nowadays it ain't shit to drop a grip on dessert
And you wanna tell the feds about some shit and it hurts
Fuck it, so be it, you 'bout to know Jesus
Turn this motherfucker back into a fetus
Phone's tapped so speak Swedish when you call the crib
Rich forever motherfucker I was born to live
Die happy, knowing that my family's straight
I hope they didn't see the numbers on that Camry plate
I been a grown man since I had a baby dick
These motherfuckers ain't saying shit
Close my eyes, spray the whip, hit your rib twice
Now your kids gotta deal with this shit cause this is life

Yeah, and I'm fucking here now
It's fucking Body
What the fuck I'm doing?

He don't even know my name
But he gon' stab something for me
He know what time it is
No watch on the wrist
Fuck outta here man
Smack the shit outta you then slap your son five
Your own family loves me more than you
Salute me every time
Every time I come to your fucking crib, it better be a plate wrapped up on the stove motherfucker
Cause you know I'm coming to eat
Fuck that I don't even want firsts, I want my seconds first
That's right, I eat right out the motherfucking pot
Fuck a spoon, I been eating hand to hand my whole life
I motivate myself motherfucker
Anytime I need to think about some shit man
I just go back and close my motherfucking eyes man
And go back to the sorrow
Fuck outta here man
My whole life is a fucking discography b
You stupid? Quadruple platinum
Oops, what's that? Another one
Am I rapping or what?
I can't hear the headphones yeah
Turn me up in the headphones
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Ok, alright

Jump tumble
Front flips off the roof like a stunt double
My shorty doing kegels for her cunt muscle
Keep her shaped up
The M3 all green fly like a strange duck
My dad was right when he said I was a deranged fuck
Now every meal is calamari and boudin blanc
Saddam Hussein guns
Held by nuns who do drugs while beige hard bottoms slide on the new rug
Pinky up
The joint thicker than Pinky's butt
Just as stinky
Nick Van Exel with the handle, Helsinki
Eggs Rothko
The handmade suit cloth hang out the sports coat
Twenty three and a half feet on the sports boat
Brown vest made of suede on my torso
Close my eyes, inhale deep, sail free
Blind fury, hoppin' out the braille jeep
Serve me snails to eat
No ham and cheese
I'm tanning
The 540i, color salmon
Smoke a cannon
Push the seat back
Put your feet up
Roll my weed up

Why's it feel like my life is moving fast, yo?
Get your own, don't worry about my cash flow
I need a chick to hide the hammer in her asshole
I need that first class dough(x2)

It's me Big Body
Who the fuck else?
You gotta pardon my absence man
I just came back off of vacay man
Just spent the whole fucking weekend up in Orchard Beach
Living the fucking life
I was out there Wildin
Had your moms on the motherfucking boogie board
Doing all types of stunts
But now I'm back though
Ain't shit changed
Just came back, check my motherfucking emails
Got more motherfucking deals on the table
Don't even know what the fuck to do now
Shit
Oh my god
You can still see me though
Out there on Fulton street at 3 in the morning
Bench pressin' a fiend
Ain't shit changed still loitering

Ok, Ok
I'm relyin' on Viacom to keep my lights and fire on
Made a deal with Lucifer, said, "give me the universe" (Every Single Planet)
It hurts kind of like losing your first love
I saw the bright lights and started doing the worst drugs
Now, I'm backtracking and hash rappin' with Action
Throwing hand grenades at paddywagons in passing
Old fashioned soul grabber snorting all the coke up
The type of shit to turn a World War into a Polka
Polo'd up, the double RL icon
Steppin' out the limo, tuxedos made of python
Listening to Lionel Richie, fuckin with the lights on
Rice on the table, have us going all night long (Again, and again, and again)
Rooftops, sippin on some red wine
Start to realize I've been trippin, shit its just fine
So, I read a passage out the Bible as I take a bath
Dry off, Hit the Colosseum on Jamaica Ave
Bout to say fuck it and form a union
March up to city hall and protest pollution. (Yes!)
I got a brand new car
I got a jazz guitar

Welcome, everybody

Thank you a lot for coming, it means a lot to me
Steer the yacht with my knee, plenty of botany
Damn, bad chick on top of me, pornography
And I know she only want me for my guap-ery
(Ahem... let me get my voice right
Gary, sorry, 1, 2, 3, 4)
It's the first time ever
Yo fuck this jacket, I turn this shit to 85 napkins
Since Jeter's done I'm now the captain
Trust you me, Gotham's safer now
But there's always a new joker in town
Ready to smoke you with that pound
But when he shoots it, the flag says "BANG!" and everybody laughs
He must be up and off the molly tab
I'm by the bar lookin' Swedish in the trenchcoat stupid
The only one drinkin' mango lassi in the bullpen
My lips are sealed like the singer with bad skin
My need for speed made the Jag spin
Dog, I'll resurrect Freaky Tah to do my ad-libs
Overseas I prolly got mad kids
That I don't even know about, you better slow down, baby
I'm still young, fuck it, gotta use it while it works
Nothin' lasts forever, or does it? Fuck it
Shout out to my cousins, all of 'em

I got a brand new car
I got a jazz guitar

I'll take it back to playin' handball and smokin' on the park benches
Dippin' cabs and hoppin' fences
Laughin' all the way back to the buildin' runnin'
Got to the door, twist the key, elevator waitin' for me
100, got upstairs and fixed eleven bowls of Crispix
Grabbed a Snapple out the bin, no one's an even match for the kid
Legs are made of stone, the back of a bridge
In goal line situations I'll tackle the fridge
Peace to Mike Ditka, 50 on the light fixture
Right side shifter, fight fixer, twist your sister
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hair band, mothafucka
It's Bam Bam doin' ah ah ah ah

Out with the, ah!
I can't even get this fuckin' right, are you kidding me?
I'm ashamed of myself, I'm sorry
Fly Mary in to sing to that cow before we slaughtered it
And then I ordered it

Don't say a word to me
You already committed perjury
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that
You know better, you better save that

Laid by the pool, my legs gettin' massaged by a professional
Strictly business, nothin' sexual
Seasonal vegetables lookin' exceptional
You ain't think I was hot then, now you wanna hum on my testicles
I'm from a dirty borough where that Sun don't come out
But when the moon come and the goons come, the crew runs
Like a big Jamaican, I stand adjacent
To that S600 in amazement
My time gon' come, I'm headed to the top
Like I never wore makeup, and I'm ready for the spotlight
You know I got my hoodie on, and it's such a hot night
Shit I'm straight from Queens, catch me in the limo like it's prom night

Don't say a word to me
You already committed perjury
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that
You know better, you better save that

This that do a hundred in the rental in the rain
With the jammy, a day before I have to go to Spain
Livin' on the edge, different colored women in my bed
Different, different colored linens on my leg
My mother said I better win or else she'll fuck me up
Ma we did it, I love you, you lucky slut
Since I was young I had the husky gut
But I'm gorgeous, got money in the pouch just like a tourist
Swerve in a Skylark, big piece of the pie chart
Bitch this is fine art, I gets my shine on
You lyin', dog, you never even put the iron on
You drive a Scion, you ain't ridin', dog
Me, I'm cell built, grab your chest
Still get hit with right hands from left field
My life is a kaleidoscope
She makes me feel just like I'm high on dope
I never calm down, shoot the gun without puttin' my son down

Don't say a word to me
You already committed perjury
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that
You know better, you better save that

You should have been known who the fuck this was
Just by my fuckin' tongue
Big fuckin' Body Bes
You know I'm all over everything now
You know me, you might see my face stamped on a bag of dope
Out here gettin' filthy cause you know I got that ooh woo woo. You know me, I go home and change up
I get fresh to fight. Just caught a new fuckin' case. But it's alright though, I got this stupid mothafuckin' lawyer
He told me, "Don't even worry about that shit, Body. I'll make that go away
Now what's for lunch?" I told him, don't worry, I got the hookup
Anything you want. Crown Fried on me, 1 through 6 only

The type of mothafucka wear a three piece suit to go to court, shook to death
And you there for smokin' weed
Piece of shit, get the fuck outta here
Look baby don't play me, play lotto okay, you gotta try to cum okay

With the zipper, damn I know her kitty hurt
10 hour shifts she thinking' bout retiring
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I think she lying man
She'll suck a Jewish lawyer, or an African cabby
"It ain't about the money, tryna get back at my daddy

Dos en el morning, rocking sweatpants ya know what up
Slowly approaching animals in motion
Pussy safari, twenty for a lay
Ten for a BJ, but free for some free base
Before I purchase, I wanna peek at the turkey
Make sure that its perky so it won’t turn my dick to jerky
Open the door, soon as she sat down, she took a bump
She caught the rush, then made a hooker grunt
Let’s talk about me, I’m always on the road
Got a little dick, many of the secrets I behold
Name is dano born in the Bronx, half Puerto Rican
Drive a truck hooked on dope cook a soul
Was once a prospect for the twin now im on a mission
Cryin naked shootin dope up in the kitchen
Falling asleep right on the shitter
Word to Roberto Clemente dog I’m still a hitter, yeah!
Fuck the light at the end of the tunnel
Cause I'm living for today, trying not to drown in a bottle
Death all around me, drugs seem to numb me
Mental's getting sicker, the Devil's getting comfy
Acupuncture with the smoke like I'm Mason Storm
Legs crossed like a Buddhist, smoking Buddha
Angry tuna, chilling, getting brain from Uma
Used to lose, now everybody kangaroos
Hop off the schnitzel, see me on Kissena
Smoke the marijueena, always been the same guy
Whether balling on a yacht, or hauling from the cops
I'm flooring on the Fox, 'til I'm swelled up in a box
All you gotta do is see me when you see me
I'm burning bitches from the TV like a CD
I'm trynna live the life in 3D
So you could nibble on my pee-pee
We out in Fiji

From having money on my mind to having money in my pocket
Bone marrow roasted
Spread it on the rosemary bread, lightly toasted
Drizzle with the vinaigrette
Stuffed Duchess and it's pulling like a cigarette

Until I'm tan skinned, bitches saying that I'm handsome
'Bout to be up on the screen like Ted Danson
Suede loincloth, never fall off
Mr. Wonderful, Paul Orndorff
Leather jacket, knee length
Peace to people getting money in the 80's with the freebase
First time, you get a free taste
That's the start of a career chase, I'm eating cheese plate
Skirt steak shaved straight up off the diaphragm
Muay Thai title fights out in Thailand
I spit the fly shit, accompanied by fly bank
Use the flows that have me diving up in thighs tan
Purple rain, no Prince, summer solstice
Dope body, but her pussy's like an old fish
The antipasti is a cold dish
Yo, I'm focused, catch me out in London speaking Polish
When I’m alone
Smoking weed, sitting by the window in my home
Often thinking why the fuck is it I’m not in Rome
If I had a little motivation, money, and a hot body
I see it now, Bronson, the heart-throbby
No more pigging out, binging on the late night
No more sneaking juice in the syringe to get the game tight
No more pack of hot dogs on my neck right by the fade right
40 pounds to go and then you hookers getting laid right
I’m eating salad but I’m leaving off the croutons
'Cause ever since a youth your dog's huskier than UConn
Savings on the cookies, mommy clipping out the coupons
Passing out from over-eating, sleeping on the futon
Lock the refrigerator, there’s no controlling me
Steak and chocolate got they muthafuckin hold on me
Ain’t trying to be laid in a box, roses on me
Bronsolino running 5 miles for the glory

Lets go, 20 more to go baby boy
Yo you want that V by the crotch right?

(AH MARSHMALLOWS, GIVE IT TO ME)
You motherfucker, you, fuck you!

From philly cheesesteaks, lobsters on the barbeque
I’m getting twisted eating chicken with a prostitute
An hour later eat the burger with my drug dealer
Then add the butter to the fudge to make the fudge realer
Every five minutes look in the fridges as if magic happened
Sneak a cookie, rip the bag, and fix the plastic wrapping
I don’t want know one to know that I took it
Cause I'm an over-eater (Ay yo ock, ay yo ock, fry the mayonnaise for me, man)
Life is a smorgasbord to me and I’ma over do it
I wanna wear Italian clothing but it just don’t cut it
Not the type that show the package with the crystal studded
The shit they model in Milan that’s looking crispy custom
5 and 6 bitches, lickin’ my dick twitches
Serve up a facial, Mister Belding, bitches dismiss ‘em
For now I’ll take what I can get till this shit switches
Whatever fuck you stupid bitch
Peace to the Drums of Heaven
Peace to beef ribs
Extended lunch time I eat enough for three kids
Go on a diet, then fall off because I’m weak kid
Since I was young I’m eatin’ candy on the sneak tip
My day is based upon fine drugs, cholesterol
Though at my height and weight im probably still the best at ball
I’m tatted up, I have no shame to show the chest at all
I bet I have your lady humming on my testicles

Yeah, Bronsolino
Bout to be fuckin, summer time in the winter
Shirtless
Ayo, you ready? Yeah, I'm ready right, the fast life
Getting twisted almost every night, my mind is deeper
Than the voice featured on Barry White, I'm not the marry type
I make her sit in vinegar to get the candy tight
I’m flattered at all the chatter and comparisons
To the great, soon to see me right on Madison
Bally sneakers trying to stay up out the vat of sins
I tout the tacky shit I'm like a wild Iraqi
Outdoors with my sport vest, leather on the shoulder
Hold the rifle in place, knife in your face
I’m out the world just like a lightning in space
The ice sculptures on the table going nice with the plates of grapes

This is madness, certified madness
Rapping like a bandit, serving my advantage
Singlehandedly slam you to the canvas
Marijuana leaves are getting wrapped just like a bandage

Fuck the love, I want the money and the pussy
Brazilian bitches, names tatted on their tushie
You're a man dressed as a woman, call him Tootsie
I'm in the corner with a hooker playing footsie
Phone in my hands at all times like I'm a pimp, fuck shrimp
We eat steak, wine and cheese plate
Bronsonline the name is ringing out in each state
Play it cool or taste the weapon, time to meet fate
My feet slide just like a hockey player
Eating yakitori, getting hammered in the sake lair
Sucky sucky, happy ending shower
Wifey making dinner, I’ll be home about an hour
Crush the sour, dutches from the Netherlands
My rolling skills is undefeated yo you’ll never win
I bring the devil in, Bronson known for his benevolence
Polo fitted with a leather grip


I wash my dick in the sink right when I wake up
Twisted from the night before raw inside a frightening whore
Hop in the whip and go for breakfast
Fried eggs and prime steak that's straight from out of Texas
Damn I’m living reckless, smoking all day just like the brisket
My beard is golden brown just like a biscuit
Everyday I’m thinking should I risk it, add another number to statistics
Or use the breast milk to eat my Crispix
I’ll feed her coke for a dick suck
Put a fucking roman candle up in this bitch butt
Now it’s on the computer, got the pussy moister than Bermuda
Pop a hole right through her throat, that’s no joke cause I’mma shoot her

Yeah, damn, yo, fuck
Yo, three verses ain't enough anymore these days man? Fuck

This shit is rawer than a tuna on a plate for eighty dollars
Or the sex that I be having though I hate my baby momma
It’s always drama, she got too much time on her hands
Watching Tyra steady planning a plot on your man
My eyes are open like an owl though
Animosity, trying to get the paper, sour dough
But if I die before the hour go
Just place the Ballys on my feet and smoke my body like a pharaoh ho
Egyptian fixtures, patties by the colliseum
Guns from Russia, I turn 'em to a ballerina
Cop the work then they bagging coke
Transporting interstate, Carolina to Tobacco Road
To the knee or to the ankle where the jacket go
Master flow work now so I got cash to blow
When I’m older, leather on a rugby shoulder
I’m top dogging if I’m lying may they slump me over
I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice. I mean, listen, we talkin' about practice. Not a game, not a game, not a game, we talkin' about practice

Peace to Bloodstain, Beamer custame
On a California king where the thug lay (that's word to me man)
The joint longer than Mutombo finger, my features etch
Shorty sniffin' lines like a sketch
Tell her that I need my slippers fetched
I need a wifey tongue longer than Kakey
Shoot the gun right when I whistle, plus she never will snake me
Do a split on my dick
If I'm sick she'll even clean me if I shit in my pants
So I'm taking her to France with me

No time for struggle cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away

Doing math like an Asian student
I've been a truant, three language fluent
Blueish on the Buick
Reddish on the hue of the cheeks on my booby
Her body smoking like a dooby
The joint rolled like a croissant, mad butter
Golden brown
If I end up in the can then who gon' hold me down?
Probably no one
They like it when you hot, when you not
They tell you eat a cock off the springboard I dive into the drop
Gold watch, like I just retired
No socks in the loafer cause it's tacky
At least I'm not up in Pataki's
You catch me higher than a Shaq knee
See me swerving side to side like Mutombo finger
The bundle bringer, guns are subtle
Hear them clapping like the end of the huddle
I might be big as a bear, but nothing to cuddle
Hop in the shuttle, land in Russia, yo

No time for struggle cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away

It's a proven fact money make the world go round
And a couple sweet words'll make your girl go down
On the whole team cause you weren't taking care of business
See me in a Bimmer, see you in a Civic, uh

No time for struggle cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away

Guy: Oh man, would you tell these motherfuckers what it is please?

Anywhere I go, you know you're goin' with me
Bobby and Whitney without the sniffin'
Dog your bitch look like Eddie Griffin
I'm three wheelin', keep the Chevy tippin'
Big bearded Buddha bangin' bitches in Bermuda
Barry Bonds, barracuda, Chattanooga
Back alley shooter, black Balley booter
Catch me jumpin' out the plane like a black puma
Stoned, pump Depeche Mode

He was goin' for the glory in the end zone
Just another Saaab story cause the pen's cold
Am I gonna sell my soul? That depends, ho

All that seems we're goin' nowhere
Goin' nowhere, nowhere

NYC what the fuck is goin' on?
These mothafuckas won't play my song
They sayin' that we soft, they sayin' that we fell off
They sayin' that these other fuckers better than us, you gotta be kiddin'
A bunch of pussies, when you piss, you gotta be sittin'
You tie your hair in a bun and shirt in a knot
You got the urge to suck the cock of Serge Ibaka
Pictures of naked rappers hangin' in your locker
You and your father never played catch, he taught you how to twerk
Since I've been on the Earth I've been lightin' up
And I've been all around the world twistin' dykes and purp
Shit, light the earth

Only in America
Just can't seem to get you off of my mind
Only in America
All that seems we're goin' nowhere
Only in America

The best things in life are free

Joy, Ajax. Shit… ayo, this is what I be doin' on that…

Orlando Magic warm-up suits and black Shaqs
'95: younger Bronson on the fast track
To blast gat, now I'm looking past that
I want the cash stack higher than the NASDAQ
I put the work in, the downtime I'm cooking lamb
A thousand Dutches in the air like it's a reefer jam
Aretha jam, you better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me
Or risk the forest where the motherfucking rest your team be
Peking duck, and large liver, goose carver
Swiss Bally's, smoke cigar just like a new father
You know the motto, jacket to the knee
I can't help if I'm a fiend, I had to tap into the beat, Lord
Spark a seance, cause everybody lifted
I'm like the strainer with the fucking powder being sifted up
This is Queens Day, alleys where the fiends play
Yo cuff the Guess on the construction, take it easy

This for my people making sales until they back hurt
See the beast on the creep, they let the Mac squirt
Bitch on the backs, that do the dippies on the bikes, and
Loud pipes and rocking leathers like a wild Viking
My man who just came home, and some are going up
Fiends up in the alley, sippin Balley fucking throwing up
Keep your mind straight, focus on the prize
Always diving into thighs, blowing smoke into the skies

Bronsonelli the problem, we got the party reeking
Never see us starving, all my people hardly speaking
When it's time, though, we form into a single file
Spray the fucking ballcourt without hitting a single child
Hop in the Beamer, Pigeon popping the nina
Getting top in a steamer, scoping rock in a Tina
Hooker, that type of looker eat the pussy from the back
Take the children to the school, baking cookies, serving packs all day
Know the verbal, is Oscar-winning
You cop a squat to piss in, only focused on them rocks that glisten
Suppositories in the ass of you, the green Fila with a Horsey how this motherfucking bastard do
Bet the crib that you ain't fucking with this grown man
I'll E. Honda a thousand, slap you with the whole hand
Sex a dime, herbally, a blessed time
Check the rhyme motherfucker, better recognize


The eyes slanted from the origami, I roll a quarter of the water
Near the border, where you oughta find me
The Tamborine Man pumping while the Tyson burning
Air Tech Challenge, clay court, checks balance
Stay endorsing that weak shit, my team spit
That mean shit, like stepping in some fiend's shit
Now you sick to your stomach because you stunted
Word got fronted, another motherfucking jerk confronted
Post pattern, Lonnie threw the loaf at 'em
Flushing, motherfucker, keep a toast up by the gold Saturn
Little doulas on the block we tell 'em "go stab 'em"
Relieve him of his shoes, it's easier to toe tag 'em'
Carhartt sets and Horseys like the Preakness
Bronson love a freak bitch, dining on that Greek dish
That's the a-hole, all my people AWOL
Cash inside the case and now the judges want to play ball
Since the last time I seen you boo I been around the world
Drugs is gettin' twirled, while driving something absurd
Something you never seen, gold and forest green
Leanin', growl like a demon, the tires smoking when I'm leaving
Playing poker on the river boat
Hid the ace long rifle in my bitch's coat
Flip off the balcony, knife to the throat, ice in the coke
Coke on the table, wild n' out in Roanoke
Hall & Oates we at the benefit for wild owls
They had the freshwater bass served five styles
Flix with Ellen DeGeneres rockin' Perry Ellis
Been a degenerate cutting ribbons with senators
Knock on my door with balloons and that big check
I'm not surprised though still dippin the 5-0
It's all about survival, me and Supplies man alive on arrival

I got the drugs rolled perfect
The gold turkish, Flow furnished
I been a earner, just call me earnest
Leave the logistics to attorneys, but if its money it concerns me
Yo wake the fuck up tell my bitch to pull the truck up
Had the marijuana rolled up bitch this shouldn't be a hold up
So much paper it don't fold up, grab the plastic it won't mold up
I'm on the boat smoking gold dust
I marry ya niece, cash me out in Paris for fleece
Shoot the back of ya knees, Gary Sinise
Speaking Arabic in Greece
Grown men turn the keys to cheese, as I water ski Belize

I seen a lot but I ain't seen it all
Dreams to ball but I ain't talking bout Seton Hall
Hot red Lamborghini, special seat and all
Plus the doors open up like a season whore
Now you motherfuckers are sour, wishin' you had the vision
Could've been doing division, stay in the coupe like a pigeon
Apartment is getting close to the roof ya boy is risen
Greek men, jump off the back of the boat for dinner
Barehanded snatch up a octopus I'm a winner
Grill it, hit it with olive oil and lemon
Then kiss my fingers, efharisto that was delicious
Catch me on Venice Beach working on my base, no blonde streak
Swimming trunk, 30K in arm's reach
I'm on the boat, in the water like a swan's feet
To show respect you kiss both sides of the Don's cheek
360 on the Seadoo in a tux
Call my homie, tell him meet me down in Lido Beach for lunch
Plácido Polanco crib, his bitch was black
She started purring, I kissed the cat
Aristocrat, wrist dancing like a disco bass
In the holster, same shit color as Sisqo's hair
635 slammed like a suplex
Cheat off a Chinese kid just like a school test
I'm on the hunt for loot, jump out the chunky coupe
Hold on, wait till it thunder, here's the gun to shoot
Beige leather to the calf, where my math at?
You gonna babysit my joint? Then pussy pass that

I'm getting paper regardless, I'm never facing no charges
I got your honor under the armpit
The gavel slam and I walk
Hammer dances on the porch, downtown gallivanting with a horse
Two different drugs to choose, I need the third thing
Oriental style shirt
Flapping in the wind like a bird's wing
I need that good green, ugh, motherfucker need that good green

I got the face like a grown lion, my people hold iron
Predict the weather by the wind like an old Mayan
Hold my son up, show him to the kingdom
While all his blood brothers became drug runners in England
Made in Queens, Handball courts and 40s
Shorties smoking blunts, spades in the corner
We moving white like David Spade in the sauna
All the money chronological, it look like callaloo
Provide the crew designer suits, exotic food
Erotic nude and polished shoes, impala smooth
Roll up, looking like Sinbad with the earring
Lightskin sucking my penis while I'm steering
I'm pro
Yeah yeah (uh-huh)
It's me, it's me (uh-huh)
I was hatched in '83 (yeah)
Fuckin' standin' like the Notre Dame logo right now
A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Just leave this shit, man

If I choose the right horse (uhh) I'mma buy a white Porsche (uhh)
Never take the night off (uhh) I'm sayin' that my mind's off (uhh)
Ever since I came out (uhh) I been handin' pain out (uhh)
Fold a wire hanger through your nose, take your brain out
Hey now, on the stage, I'm like great balls of fire (uhh)
One more year, I'll be on Lake George retired (just one)
Big steak like a Jeep tire (uhh)
Season up some biceps and throw 'em in the deep fryer

I been high since I was this big, yeah, uhh
I been high since I was this big, stupid

I'm sick like feedin' squirrels the summer in a bubble jacket
If this was '96, I def' had The Tunnel packed in (it's true)
Big beard like I'm lumberjackin' (uhh)
Mash the pedal of the 850, sound like the thunder crackin'
I'm in a club with a condom on (hahaha)
All Under Armour on (yeah)

And when I die
Make sure you spread my blood on a BMW
And when I die
Make sure you spread my blood on a BMW

Microphone attached to my head so I can dance my little heart out
Don't make me bring the white guitar out
Like the one in Wayne's World, that was shinin' in the window
Since 13, I been a nympho, uhh
Fuck, That's Delicious on box set
Me and my mans smokin' on big drugs and feasting on the ox leg
Stand in the store with twenty Ahmed's (a-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!)
Bazookas on shoulders, hundred pounds of C4 in a stroller
Z4s roll up, shit's cold, I think I need a ricola
I just dropped a million kroner, I'm a stoner (uhh)
You lack culture, I'm a psychedelic image of a black vulture
Trapped inside a past soldier, uhh (It's me)

I just blew my motherfuckin' high, man (ho!)
Holy shit
I been high since I was this big, motherfucker

And when I die
Make sure you spread my blood on a BMW
And when I die
Make sure you spread my blood on a BMW

Albanian style, I wanna die by machine gun
(A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!)
I mean man, I made 872 million off molasses yesterday
Straight up
I’m only rhymin cause I’m nice
I don’t even give a shit no more
We on our way

Look at the game say bitch I deserve you
Here forever, that's my word boo
I know my words slurring now but when I sober up
I just called to see how the fuck you've been holding up

I know you heard your boy's been hopping out the Rover truck
Long remove from when I rode the bus
Now I'm diving up in Polish sluts
With the gorgeous butts
And she love it when I throw her in the Cobra clutch
Window half down
Smoke trickle out
Stripper vixen out the blouse
Put the pickle in the pouch
No more sushi, style reserved for the past days
Big joints filled with hash in my ashtrays
We still fam' though we chose different pathways
I heard you're sniffing
Cleaning plates like the Cascade
Death's the only thing that's certain
Once was the cash fades
Fuck it, I'm getting money til my last days


Your number changed and I ain't recognized the ringtone
So pardon for the unannounced
The rain, you know I've been gone
Flip the fucking beat up
I was looped around the planet
In the coupe with the cannon
With the car and the camera
Paparazzi never flashed
The days are way beyond us
Fact, they never flash and I'm below the surface, honest
Never blast my way out
I stroll out, pull by
Under the nose of anybody that knows not
Check-in's out of courtesy cause these are not requirements
Wait until our time is up; iron and the niacin
Boomer Esiason, flying out the Lion's den
This is weird science, inside a siren's blend
I hit the solid ten, water just a little splashing
Loop it up and bring it back man, cause this is Action
Yeah
It’s me
I’m here
Swerve
Light it

Yo
I’m on the PCH, smokin’ THC
With the team, money be the dream
I take it multicolor baby, it ain’t gotta be green
On the other side of earth with the queen, I’m from Queens
Shit, 3 different types of forks for a Monday lunch
Tamarind punch, higher than a javelin jump
Italian sluts, my whole battalion is nuts
We rock medallions and such
Don’t even step within six feet of my presence
Leave you open like the desert, Def Leopard, Fresh pepper
Did I mention, steer the whip with one arm like Jim Abbott
Chocolate sauce over thin rabbit
If these opportunities arose before we would’ve been had it
Shorty sniffing haddock in the attic
I been an addict in these streets, in my pants I’ve even shatted
Then sat in it, sadly
Two things about to cop a few rings
And eat paper thin slices of the Blue Ling
Shoot eagles on a Jack Nicklaus course, Porsche with the triple exhaust
Seats soft like a midget’s cough
*coughs*
Yeah, let’s hear that fly shit
*coughs*
Yeah man
Oh fuck

I never thought that this could be my life
Russian mistress and Parisian wife
Always seasoned rice, the animals you find in the jungle on the table sculpted in ice
Throw the dice
Leg drop after a big boot
1, 2, 3, it’s over, slide in the mint coupe
Dive out the chopper in the water, uh
No splash, Olympic shit
Ayo, the spliff look like a shrimp when it shit
Smoke the shark, Greg Norman shit, me and Robert Horry in a foreign whip
Motherfucka I was born to live
And born to fuck a lot of pussy without spawning kids
It’s me
You said that I was worthless
Sure enough the toxins came up to the surface
I'll take your oxygen I'm perfect
Better bring your iron to the skirmish
Step on heads of serpents, smoke detergent
Robert Downey Jr., rotate image
Old money in the bag look like sauteed spinach bitch
Manicurin' like a China, spin out the beamer at the arena
Bitches spot me like a cheetah
Wild life, wild nights with your wife (twice, dyke)
Now who the one that be turnin' the wheel in the old Deville
Step in the field, suckas know I'm real
Long sword down the leg so I stand still
Red beard so I resemble Jim the Anvil
Neidhart, ride dirty in the five sharp
Hand skills, Jean Claude, fine art
Put my head right through the Monet, ole
All the drugs I smoke, my lungs are probably coal gray
Ice on the Rolly, dykes on the pole play
Gravitatin' towards the money cause it brings me joy
Only thing next to my baby girl and baby boy
Drop Mercedes toy
With your moms butt naked cookin' eggs like Ving Rhames in Baby Boy
You know the outcome, you ain't about none
Smoke 'til my mouth numb
Hold the chopsticks at the top you know I'm upper class
Grab the sizzle beef with my teeth
Hop in the vehicle, lit the keef
Back in the streets, it's me

Yo this is Bam Bam and I'm representin' Flushing
Smokin' blueberry like a muffin
Yo I'm the one your lady lovin'
Just tell that bitch I need a scrubbin'
And don't forget the chicken in the oven
Never burn a dinner, spend cake on cheese
Red mirror lenses in the gray Oakleys
Flip out the plane with a cape on skis
Girl I really love it when you're dancin' on me
Dancin' on me, dancin' dancin' on me
No time flat I'm gonna be on TV
With a big batty gal, skin tropical
I'm doin' all the things you never seen possible
Blow the smoke out, the BBS's poke out
Daddy did the three-piece and mommy brought the cloak out
Nowadays you can catch me out in So Cal
Spendin' five stacks in a week in the grow house
Now I'm highed up, makin' popcorn
Flip the bag this side up
Then sit back on the couch
And let me put my penis in your mouth
Cause girl I really want some head tonight
You can find us in the garden like Spike on any night
Encrusted in some ice that look bluish in the light
Spanish on the mistress, Jewish on the wife
Shootin' like a Piston, aim for proper distance
Live from London, number crunchin'
Drivin' gloves with some Asian bitches rubbin' me with sponges
Expensive lunches, wages off of hunches
I bet the dogs and if I win it then the paper yours
Pack your bag, wash your pussy, then leave
Meet me at the airport, the plane is leaving at 3
She said alright, blew smoke through my nose
It's the talented younger stallion, no Pinocchio nose

Please stop your shit's all hype dude
Meanwhile the wrist all spiteful
Just be real, that shit's not like you
Man you know these things go through a cycle
Straight from Queens rock fatigue all weather
Fila three-quarter cream feet all leather
Never sing the blues, man my team mo' better
We blow cheddar, au four feta
City lights shine bright on my complexion
Self-reflection, red hands flashing at the intersection
Life is green-lit, one star no script
Supporting actors, fresh peaches no pit
I love my people, considered as my brothers
Came from different mothers, came up in the same struggle
Some estranged, some deep up in the game still
Money separate, believe you know the fame will

Ayo macerate the fruit, tap it over angel's food
Yeah we gettin' loot, Timberland the boot
Kush is by prescription, prolific in the kitchen
People on my dick because I'm vicious with the diction
House shoes and some khakis on the west
Hit the beach up, twist the Cheech up, let the beat thump
Never fuckin' with the crab that's pre-lumped
Makin' bitches sign a pre-nup
Chocolate with the mean rump
Serve some cream stuff, shit to make the fiends jump
Crispy greenery, tropical the scenery
Believe you me, this shit ain't always what it seem to be
I'm feastin' dolo down in Eataly
I'm in the street like a hooker's feet
I'm known to sit on leather
I'm smokin' hash and marijuana cause it go together
Old school PAL at the colder center
Three AM we on the corner rockin' Polo sweater

Thank you
It might be the illest track I ever wrote
Who left it? You?
Word yo
I'm sippin' something, I gotta sip before I rap
I gotta ooo ooo ooo
Bing bing bing bing bing
Bing bing bing bing bing
Exactly
Bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing
It's rap
Medication in the plastic bag
I'm a man motherfucker, you're a half a fag
My chest is hairy like the Cubans rocking silk
In the 80s on Miami beach
You're just a rabbit that be captured by the falcons feet
I hunt for the meat see me we can thump in the street
Fuck around leave you slumped in your seat
'Cause we're coming from Queens, every platter is Zagat rated
Caramelized up, bulls are getting castrated
Hold up hold up someone pass the weed to me
Fuck a routine I'm switching up the scenery
Boats with decks strictly using throats for sex
Yoga stretch, open pussy like a sofa bed
Key lime spear fishing off the Yucatan
Grab a barracuda higher than a parachuter
Pair of shooters: Anthony and Harper
Caciocavalli dog, I'm sharper than the archer
I'm an artisan down for bi-partisan
'Cause everyone getting paid, see me with the freshest fade
Charles Oakley, gecko belts and durangos
I fuck good and make big seeds like a mango
NFL ready, sculpted for the clay court
Simple spaghetti shifting in the gray sport
Suck my dick bitch real good
Mother fuck a kid, Action Bronsolino suck my balls

No disrespect ma, I'm tryna eat the pussy
Lift your legs over you head so I can taste the tushy
King Thrust is what they call me at the hooker house
260 pounds of pressure right in a hookers mouth
5'7" with the ass of of a horse
Put it in from behind its the salad I toss
She ride me like a maniac
Best believe the bitch a brainiac
She known to keep a fresh shaven cat
Milk chocolate and her eyes like the sun
Keep a loaded 22 inside her thighs and her buns
Her pussy lips are tight just like the box of a nun
She'll have a fiend itchy and scratchy for rock in the slums
Boosting in the boostiere
I give my favorite Goose away just to get a closer look at how the juices spray
Fucking tired can't go no more
My raps are marinated days ahead
Jalapeno cream cheese on the raisin bread
That's for breakfast
I've got a death wish you never catch Bronsolino in a necklace
I'm on the block like tetris

Since a youngin' grabbed the pistol, skipped the chores
Hit the weed and said "It's on"
Got with my older Loc's they threw your boy a zone
Before my mom could smell the scent that shit was gone
Movin' on to bigger things now, don't call my phone
Carry chrome, I think them boys after me
But I shoot fast like athletes
Number one Magic flipper, I'm Anfernee
Oops, threw a couple at your coupe
Mr. Hard-top, don't fuckin' lose your roof
Smashin' on a 110
Empty most of the clip, shit only got one sin
Where's Waldo at? Put this bitch to his lens
Got the dimes all wrapped, on his block like you're still friends
Still low from the po-po, no L's in the Volvo
Mask on catch a photo when my glove's wrapped around the 4-4

Caught a statuatory rape cause the steak wasn't mature
I'm laid out by the lake, you lay with inflatable mates
I lace my shoes tight and ready for the paper chase
I like my girls with African bodies and Asian face
Only green M&M's placed in my dressing room
Pineapple juice, roast turkey
If I want, I got a bitch to suck a thirty dick circle
Then hop up in a cab, this just to serve a bitch purple
Come back, make rice for the fellas
Every single person rockin' leather
Cheddar attatched, my mental is hatched from the medicine cabinet
Rock a shirt, got the pattern of the wilderness habitat

Your family cancer took her tits off
Don't even look us in the eye
Spit the shit to make a lesbian cry, dyke
Aye yo
Sing with an accent
Portuguese
See me wiggle the Porsche keys
Grapes, crackers, gorgeous cheese
Shifting gears left handed at mighty morphin' speeds
She suck me off while I torch the weed
She throw the drug in her butt
She hasn't shit for days
She chill with dykes from the state right where the Mystic play
"You got a nice white dick"
That's what the sistas say
Hit the switch then I switch the lane
Dipped 66 in grey

So peep game
But they fronted so you know that we can't follow it
It gets deep and you can tell the way
That she swallows dick
My brain is a lethal weapon
Tongue projects them hollow tips
The vision so vivid
Feeling like you might've lived it
But you didn't
You bit it the minute that we delivered it
Just admit it get the Medikit
Break it into two like subject and predicate
Coppa for president

Sniff coke off a crisp hundred
Stay blunted, silk pants, sip France

West coast, laid back feel the breeze
Burnin' trees in diplomas, earn degrees
In the winter, mockneck circle ski
Wanna party, pop that purpley
Oh shit bam bam in the building
Scrape the women, hide the children
Give a bitch rimshot like a Zildjian
Me and Mildred eating like a pilgrim
Huh, yo Tommy Lasorda
Dodge bullets, dive into the water
True lies, diamonds at the porter
Shoot like Terry Porter, pimpin' with your Asian daughter
I'm always ready for a minor bid
Not for long cause I need me some vagina, kid
Tryna catch strange soup in the silk
Well-built with the coupe in the kilt
I need some mouth from a woman
I couldn't get it, so I took it, though I shouldn't
Sick shit like Ferrara with the footage
Stick shift in Ferrari, oh my goodness
Hood bitch, sweatpants, good tits
Fat butt, 97 Acura
Big bitch, make me want to tackle her
Fuck around Urlacher her
Enough of that, I'mma shoot dice, abusin' the wall
'Til I cruise on the shore, barbecues on the four
Mad drugs on the table and I'm doing 'em all
And I'm never gon' fall
 x2
Last time we locked eyes, slapped hands with the kid
Now you rambling kid, you should have handled that shit
When you see me motherfucker better handle your biz
Better handle your biz

Put the flame to his sneakers, I'm a pyro
Barrel revolutions got us spinning like a gyro
The suitcase is filled with filo
Here's a side-note
Fuck around, leave you on the side road
Five stars on the dinner plate
Pardon 'em, see me studded like Cardamom
Play your part cause you don't really want no part of 'em
Take the key out the ignition, shouldn't have started 'em
Joints twisted like a sprained foot
Red beard, big blue eyes, a strange look
It's like I'm chopping down trees
Jump out the chopper on skis, maltese
I'm stunned by the mountains and the sunrise
Stash work in the mattress where your son lies
Enter the casket under dirt and the guns cry
I'm going out blazing, squeezing at the one time

You ain't a boss, you just playin' boss
Pop him in his head, pray on his corpse
Knee on his neck and his sternum
Askin' for forgiveness, when I'm done I'mma burn him
You dancin' with the demons
I know you see the European leanin'
And the chain and watch gleamin'
And you thinkin' this a dreamin'
Welcome to the nightmare
Blunts, the Delorean
This shit'll travel light-years
But you gon' end up right here
My rap style is impeccable
Standing still in the mirror but seein' my reflection move
Phantom no vehicle, ghost no vehicle
A Ouija board, it ain't weed what the fuck I need it for
And what the fuck you got me heated for
Real cool nigga, show you what the heat is for
Ghost and Bronson, shoot like Bronson
Cook you like Swanson, now look at your conscience
All I want to do is buy boots, ride coupe, hide loot
Uh, flick chives in the soup
Stick knives where you poop
Backflips off the ledge, hang-glide off the roof
Land on one leg, see me all up on the front page
Holding a pump gauge, ready to dump, aim
At your nuts, like the mouth of a whore
Somersault Cadillac on the door
I been gorgeous, good friends with the florist
Transportin' work in the Sequoia
Now the chandeliers inside the foyer, feet wrapped in snake
The rug gotta hibernate, jacket tryna find a mate (sex)
Choke a duck, lay it on the plate (roasted)
Snap my fingers for the waiter come and pour the grapes (toasted)
What's the word baby? (slow motion)
Only vision out my home window (all ocean)

Suede kicks, shootin' ball at the park (swish)
Thousand on the free throw, you just a Webelow
I'm a full-grown human, half my leg covered in Ewings
You know a pussy gettin' ruined to the point where it doesn't even work
Taz and Bugs Bunny on the shirt
Hop up in the Jag and skirt
While I show you how the magic work
Take a bastard lay him down in dirt
Aim at your apple with the archery
Chef with the tweezers place the parsley for me
Person in the travel car seat's a G
I'm gettin' V while you home beatin' meat
Can I sense I'm a stud
Drink the blood of the snake
Burn a fake at the stake
Drinkin' grapes with the steak
Make a cake for your wake
Jamaican dancers on your face rockin' 8's
"His opponent from St. Petersburg, Florida"
"Two hundred thirty-one pounds, Barry Horowitz!!"

Yeah, the Chocolatier
Bronsalinio... yeah
To the back with the hat, lean back in the 'llac
Crack the window, hear the soldier styles and that in back
Ain't no "Cat in the Hat," just a cat that can rap
This is Bronson - representing Flushing, Queens on the map
Yeah - heavyweight primate with a Harvard mind
Blunts filled with the citrus mixed with orange lime
Pussy drip when the thought of Action come to mind
Born to ride, winter spring summer shine
Bonafide, eyes wide, run and hide
You don't want the revolution to be televised
Terrorfied from the Arab mountain death camps
With the iron burning hot, give you chest stamps
Phone calls with the cloth over the mouthpiece
With or without leaf, burn about an ounce chief
To the neck like a razor for the stubble
Raised inside the struggle, blazin in the huddle yeah
Dig a hole, throw the lamb in it
Left the slippers in the sand motherfuckers couldn't stand in it
("Someone took the words to my song") {*ding ding ding*}
It's Barry Horowitz rap, I pat myself on the back
Don't fake the funk on a nasty dunk, Shaq I attack
Close the window to your soul, weed inside my lungs burn
These old suckers gettin placed into a young urn
Specialized like the little bus
Use my chubby little finger first to stimulate the clitoris
King Kong ain't got shit on us
I'm out here gettin it for real while you motherfuckers filibust'
Weed in my finger flicker, I'm on a solo mission
Started at pole position, eyes on the long division
As it burn my thumb, I roll another one
Quite persistant, that's why they call me my mother's son
Shoot the cold gift, leave your ho stiff
Make your ho sniff Hootie and the Blowfish
Obey the coke king
Cause every motherfucker in rockin loaded, I'm on that old shit!
("Someone took the words to my song" - 2X)

"Barry Horowitz, always likes to pat himself on the back"
Five minute beats, one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat
Hand-craft the music, rhymes stay acoustic
Pies and Thighs on my mind all the time, roll the lime
Fuck rap I was class with my bus pass
Early nineties Tom Selleck with the moustache
Your eyes are blind to the diamond in the rough
Needle in the hay, charismatic character, far from amateur
Spider senses so I'm scanning the parameter
Straight from scrubs so my uncle is a janitor
Love my Mother, hate a motherfucker, hate a piece o' shit, hate a cocksucker
Stand beside me motherfucker you're my brother
Came from different pussies but we share the same supper

Five minute beats, one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat
Blunts stay fat, blunts stay fat

West Palm Beach betting on a dog race
Bitch with me big titties and a small waist
Pistol noise, shiftin' in a Hitler toy
Kick shit, young Ruud van Nistelrooy
Eating brisket, chilling at the bris
Knuckles like I punch walls metal in the fist
Smoking seven kinds of pepper and shit
Veteran shit, give Melissa Etheridge a dick
Stroke pussy like a cat lover
My kids are mixed that means they got a black Mother
And their Father's a G
Strictly Oolong on the tea, the shirt straight from '93, man with the ski
Peace to lo-lives Brooklyn, smart crew Queens
Sharp tooth fiends in the chartreuse jeans
Old Girbaud shit, pockets in the front
Waist 33, odd sizes out of Marshalls

Five minute beats, one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat
Blunts stay fat, blunts stay fat
Kid, Queens shit, Blue Chips shit
Yeah, here I am again, Big Fuckin' Body, it's me
We done came a long fucking way from stealing out the supermarket man
I'm out here, oh my god
We out here so fuckin' heavy man
Mr. Motherfuckin' Marvelous Himself
But enough about me man, and more about myself
We out here, all types of big situations on the table, man
And I'm just pulling my chair up man
Let me put my motherfucking paper plates up, man
Big Body
The 06 Commissary King
I had the most fuckin' tunas in the house
Rice game, soup game ridiculous man

Soap, deodorant on stack

Two buckets under the bed man

Platinum in the street
You must be out your fuckin' head

Body
Do me a favor, with that, light the candle
Is that the Hawaiian Rayman?
Aight I get the same one every single time, I don't understand this

At the piano with a glass of pino
All red silk like I'm nino
Custom made shit, I weight 140 kilos
Sneeze on 100G's, hoes on their knees blow from Montego
The way my hair look you swear my name was Rodrigo
Lay low, if you can't do it then just say no
If you ain't built to play this game then you get halo'd
I put a lot of fiends in k-holes

Hello
Hi
What's up mama?
I just watched  perform
How do you feel about it?
They ain't you baby hahaha, you're better than all these shit heads

I'm just a bastard with a bad habit
Bad back in a black Volkswagen Rabbit
Shit I gotta have it
Black magic woman put a spell on me
Fuck around and win a spelling bee
I could walk under ladders, still win the lotto
Ten minutes flat, built a boat in a bottle
Roy Rogers bathroom, sniffin' coke with a model
Told her to Google me, shit I might paint the Cougar green
All this lechuga in my jeans
I still see Freddy Kruger in my dreams
Ain't nothin' moving but the cream
Shit, know I do it for team

I just wanna hear em announce your name, that's all I care about
How's your knee?
My knee is... It's not bad these past few days
You been alright?

That's all I care about
Took a meeting up at Paramount
Typecast as a romantic lead
I'm classically trained for drug dealing
But I wasn't good at drug dealing
So I flipped shit, rug, ceiling
Dry water, five daughters all stood 5'4"
Or got 5 quarters for the store

Fuck knows what I'm saying anymore mane, my mind is shot, been working so motherfuckin' hard
So I'm bout to light this motherfuckin' dab up
Til the next time, peace
Yeah, Bronson
(Nina Sky)
This my mothafuckin' game man
I don't give a fuck what nobody says no more
No more playing the sidelines (Yeah)

Albanian style: rock leathers in the sand
I’ll shoot my cousin for nothing: dominant man
Go visit fam with no problems - on some normal shit
Straight from Skopje, Macedonia, the floral lit
Licorice liquor, one cube, a touch of water
Watch it mix, turn white like the Duchess' daughter
I’m in the corner puffing Ganja with the musky odor
Destination back of your throat - cup of soda
Uh. This is Bam Bam Bigelow, Queens to Asbury Park connect: Figaro
My uniform Carhartt sweats and Gore-tex athletic horses on my chest and on my short sets
The Leslie Nielsen of the weed and the words
This is Action Bronsolinni, 33 and the 3rd, kid
Naked gun, the serial is scratched off
Armed like Rocket in his prime, blast off

On and on, push it through, we won
Never stop till the day we there
On and on, push it through, we won
Never stop till the day we there

Push your seat back. The Rickey Henderson of rap
Jets hat, underneath a little blubber lie the 6 pack
Summer time I cop the musket with the kick back
Then sit back, stand up, eyes low, hit that
This happens continuously throughout the night
Now my eyes are like diamonds, that’s looking blue-ish in the light
Like a prism, shooting out hope, honor, and optimism
Never stop it till we're coastal on the aqua mission
Reach my hand in the water and grab a tuna
Silhouette you see reflection of light, right off the Mezzaluna
That’s a half moon, wavy like my man’s fade
The European carry-all. Color: tan, suede
Handmade, hand blades, carve up your features, I’m a creature
Section 39 - I’m in the bleachers
Fiends get washed up like turtles on the beaches
It’s mating season make the verbal for your speakers

On and on, push it through, we won
Never stop till the day we there
On and on, push it through, we won
Never stop till the day we there

Il prosciutto
Legend, Phil Rizzuto
Marijuana like the pussy, I keep it crudo
That’s raw, now I declare war
You in the women’s league
I show you how a man score
Look at my beard and my body like a grizzly
I’m shoulder pressing 3 plates
Obama - EBT. I'm a G. Supermarket sweepstakes
Still drinking vintage out the bottle with the cheese plate
The Derek Harper with the low Caesar, flow fever
More than likely digging in your ho's beaver
Drug smoke to my neck just like a turkey
Dough dirty, make your brother do a curtsy. no mercy, Van Buren cop Hershey
Square Tyson and I’m in the mountains eating rare bison
Clam chowder, you ain't fucking with this man-power
Straight from Queens, where we're known to make your plans sour

On and on, push it through, we won
Never stop till the day we there
On and on, push it through, we won
Never stop till the day we there
I smoke drugs as if it's cigarettes, Popping like a giga pet
See my silhouette, right behind me bitches pirouette
That's a dance move, it's origin is French
I'm chilling in the park with several warrants on the bench
Suspended license, Over four years, that's three cars after
Cause I'm like a mush, everything is a disaster
Put 'em in the bathroom, cause that'll be the answer
Let 'em know I'm sick and every flow is like a cancer
Catch a rooster, cut his fucking nuts off
Serve 'em for a hundred dollars, sesame and plum sauce
Try to dip the bill, the Mexicans'll let the guns off
Or cut you with a pleasure similar to getting nuts off
Your whore told me that your putz soft
Plus she caught you in the basement with a tranny getting sucked off
Wheres your morals? Your genitals are floral
Like it in the back just like a fucking epidural
Me, I'm like a caveman, raised from out the mountains
Oriental bathhouses, laying on the couches
Cop a rub-and-tug until I'm spraying like a fountain
Take a hundred out my pocket, lay it on the counter
Peace, arrivederci, bouncing towards the exit
Asian lady crying because I left her fucking legs split
Dookie blunt of regs 'til I'm pookie in the face
Queens, the kid's a star like a Mookie on the base
The flows water, like rafting on the Congo
Take a hit of drugs and I'm passing like I'm Rondo
Motherfuckers sweeter than when Omar kisses 'Naldo
Get it straight sick, so I simmer up the caldo, de pollo
Look in my eyes you know I'm royal
Hustle up some money like Sidney and Billy Hoyle
Puerto Rican shorty, features like she's Rosie
Titties like a motherfucking pocket full of posies

Uh
Elevator, just take me to the top please
Rocking all white silk, whipping drop V's
Elevator, just take me to the top please
Rocking all white silk, whipping drop V's
Bronson speaking:
Yeah, I wanna be rocking all white silk, on the beach
In the moonlight, with my Nubian queen
Yeah I said it, I love you

Obama copped me the sandwich, I dipped the cops like I'm Sanders
For minor work, get your momma murked, napkin covered designer shirts
Cause we eating like some animals to say the least
Bronsolin' bust a nut right in your favorite niece
Smoke in my lungs when I'm driving on the FDR
Steering with my knees, and I'm rolling, almost wrecked the car
Squatting twelve plates, all I do is set the bar
Call your father, your a doula coulda stacked the bar
Making dough, baking bread just like the French
Hustle until we're living right, sleeping on the benches
Swinging for the fences, helicopter chauffeur
Cyclops catch you with the lasers and the lenses
Arnold Palmer on the graphic in the beverage
Everything I do myself, I'm using that for leverage
About to rape the game 'til this motherfucker hemorrhage
Moat around the crib and garages full of Benzes

Uh
Elevator, just take me to the top please
Rocking all white silk, whipping drop V's
Elevator, just take me to the top please
Rocking all white silk, whipping drop V's
Bronson speaking:
Yo shouts to the Lord man
Get seared up like fucking salmon
Uh
Bronsolino, Statik Selektah
Queens to Boston
Puss
Meanwhile, behind the facade
There lurks the secret of a strange Albanian genius

I'm like a young Bill Kazmaier, swollen from the juice
Primobolan in my hemoglobin, chiefin' on the spruce
Rocking all white silk, shorts just stop at the knee
Stay saucy like a pasta, with the broccoli, who's stopping me?
You gotta be out of your mind, I'm an anomaly
Salt and pepper beard, distinguished look just like I'm Connery
Escape the rocks, see me rollin' through the furnace
If I make it to the top, it's cause this motherfucker earned it
Well since I'm high, straight polenta from the pot
On some bad lieutenant shit, show me how you suck a cock
Hoppin' out the 97 Cadillac d'Elegance
Pocket full of Mozza, catch me fucking with some lesbians

Man fuck that Bronson, don't even say something to these faggots, you already know what time it is, we fuck around and fuck their fathers, up

I love chocolate just like Colagaro, from Flushing out to Kosovo
My family pedigree picnics with Berettas
Filas on the slippers, windbreaker pants and sweaters
Very clever, ancient blood line gettin' cheddar
Cobblestone the streets, shifting manual in Benzes
Neighbor with the hoxha, him and all his shit offends
So we gather up the lamb, he sacrifice it properly
Stuff and twist with cabbage leaves, smoke exotically
Control the whip with one hand, listen to Hendrix
Loaded 45 chrome, tucked by the appendix
Every sentence like the Machu Picchu descendants
When I rhyme, I'm always on time, perfect attendance
I'm living splendid, blowing sticky in a rented
The olive oil virgin, first press, it's never blended, kid
I'm straight raw like Carpaccio
I'm just a heartthrob straight off the screen, just like DiCaprio

Fuck your feedback, respect the moustache
You're like a 40 dolla holla from Guadalajara
Respect the moustache
Motherfuckers ain't promised tomorrow

Roll the drugs just like I'm Morimoto, hold my nuts in my hand
That's when I pose for photo, doggy I'm often dolo
Cause I'm an only child, plus I love the silence
Just me and my thoughts, one hand grip the hooptie wheel
Soon you'll see me in the Coupe Deville
Eating stupid veal, steady aimin', shoot to kill
Walk with a cane, but no I'm not a pimp
P-P-Pinkie in the air, martini glasses full of shrimp, pussy

Yeah, straight fuckin' fly shit, shout out to my men Statik Selektah, Action Bronson, and shout out to your moms man, that made me the fuckin' man I am today. And a real fuckin' shout out to P.O. Garcia man, stop ringing my bell 9:00 at night man, you know I'm not in my crib, Big Body Bes, man
