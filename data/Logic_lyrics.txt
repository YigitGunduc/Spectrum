I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore
Yeah, uh, yeah
Livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause
Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug
Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night it's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Wakin' up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat like that
Guarantee you it’s a wrap
Finna put you on your back like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Gotta leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop
‘Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches
And the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even gotta drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg, where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight

Livin' life like this
Hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it I'ma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about what I pray about
Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the {gunshots} in the dead of night
Sellin' crack to my own pops
Pushin' this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance
'Cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
 — Get down or lay down
Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given
Anybody that’s ridin' with me, I’m ridin' with 'em
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em
And hit 'em with the venom
Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it, already been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang related
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh it’s like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show em how to act
I'ma show em how to act

Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

I been knockin doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh it's like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show em how to act
I'ma show em how to act
Ayy, bitch, I've been goin' and goin' like the Energizer
Yeah, I'm supplyin' the wood like Elijah
In the cut, smokin' on indica
Might fuck around and compartmentalize ya
They say, they say life is a bitch
And if that is the case then I'm finna surprise her
No, I am not an adviser, but I do advise ya
To pay attention, never need to mention
I'm that motherfucker bustin' heads
Finna push it to the ledge
Yeah, I been smokin' my meds
Ain't got no love for the feds
Can't let fame go to yo head
Fuck with me, watch where you tread
I'm finna kill it instead
I'm finna, I'm finna, I'm finna
Do—do—do it like I never done it
And I wanna run it and I wanna keep it goin' and goin'
Like infinity, be the only entity to ever rip it apart
From the start like this, from the heart like this
Finna murder it, a million miles a minute, no nitrous
Doin' righteous
I-I been, I-I-I been down this road before
Everybody think that they do but they don't
Swear to God that they would but they won't
Spittin' riddles in the middle of a past-time
Me in my mind, feelin' divine, like yeah
Finna get it like yeah—yeah
Like yeah, like yeah (woo, woo, woo, woo)
I done made 20 million dollars (preach)
I don't flex to be acknowledged (preach)
At this point it's common knowledge (preach)
All you haters been abolished (preach)
You in the club throwin' dollars, but I'm savin' mine so my kids go to college (preach)
Or maybe whatever they wanna do (preach)
Just as long as they never say (preach)
"Daddy blew 20 million dollars (ayy)
He had to flex to be acknowledged (ayy)
He in the club throwin' dollars
And now cannot afford to send me to college (ayy)
Daddy just wanna be loved
Just like everybody wanna be accepted (ayy)
But somehow he had neglected
Me and my momma for all of this rap shit" (ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that shit (ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that
Who you know dropped an album
Back to back to back to back to back to back again?
I'm back again to snap again
And goddamnit, it ain't no other way around it
Yeah, it's happenin', 'cause I've been livin' in a world on my own
Leave me alone, I'm in the zone
Where I've been prone to destroy shit
You cannot avoid this, whack mothafuckas have annoyed this
Yes, you know I enjoy this
Preach, mothafuckin' preach
Yeah, I'm tryna reach everybody in the streets
Writin' words to the beats
Each one teach one, yeah, I'm tryna reach one
Who the beast one?
That be me, on the top to the East one
Tell me how you really wanna do it right now, time to murder this
Shout out everybody, no fuckin' around, ain't heard of this
Heard of us, we ain't goin' nowhere, it's a herd of us
Hold up, roll up
Levitated like I'm David Blaine
Livin' a dream like I'm David Aames
Talk all you want, we are not the same
Step in the spot, now they know the name
Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry
That ain't a sign of the times
Then I don't know what is, man this shit is scary
'Cause bitch, I've been blowin' up like C-4
And I'm 3 for 3 like a free throw
Anybody hatin' on the boy, take a step back and then deep-throat
Now my phone blowin' up like ring
Like ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!
That Kevin Durant, I'm a champion
Check the numbers, I'm a champion
Can't sleep on the boy anymore
But the haters that love to hate gon' pop an Ambien
Star Lord, champion
Know the name, now they know the alias, that's for sure
Gave 'em 44, now here's 44 more
Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks
Who the bitch riding with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally getting cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothing at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard

Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'mma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be asking us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch I'm still the same
Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasing fame, chasing glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'mma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I been working hard, I been searching for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
Cause lately it feel like I’m just not your sister at all, all
I’m sorry for calling and bawling, I’m all in
And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... he left and he ain’t coming back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting an' selling that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful
Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinking 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of your family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand with me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feeling under pressure

Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga

Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors
I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now
I heard that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati cause then I gotta kill ya. I love you, son, bye
I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I’m just not as strong as I once was
When we’re together lately I don’t even feel a buzz
I’m addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go
Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I’m wondering what I’m paying for
All these other bitches on my dick but I can’t fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black
Tell me where you been Jack
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that’s what I thought at first
Me and you together, swear to God that’s all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn, took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can’t fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it’s outrageous
All I know is I’m living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don’t get me wrong, can’t forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won’t
I look away but my head don’t
I love it when you’re fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you
Nothing can replace you
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go
But you’re everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don’t seem to understand
I’m just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
Man you’re everything I crave
You’re the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I’m a king, you’re my Coretta
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine

Slave for the—
Said, I’m a slave for the nicotine
Been a slave for ya
I’m a muthafuckin' slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine
Nikki, Nikki, slave for ya
I’m a slave for ya Nikki
I’m a muthafuckin' slave for ya

All handwriting on the album's artwork was done by Big Lenbo—
Jesus, Black Jesus
Jesus, Black Jesus

I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don’t belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don’t know what's up
What's up, what's up
Yeah, yeah
Ayy

I ain’t here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
I’m just here to spread the clues
I’m just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I ain’t ashamed to be white
I ain’t ashamed to be Black
I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I’m good
Sometimes I’m misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you don’t wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha
I’m biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead
Glover instead
Like what's up
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more

I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don’t belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don’t know what's up
What's up, what's up

Damn, you're right...
Shit, I'm fuckin' high
Hold up, let me get my mind
Let me get my mind right
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright
You know everything is all

Just ride with a mothafucka
Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucka, hold me down
Chillin', In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, rockin' Adidas
With a señorita when she sippin' liquor by the liter
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino
He know we be in the casino, lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito
Whenever I step on the beat, ho
Like a killer on the creep flow
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with a sawed-off
Blowin' up like a molotov
This is war, everybody, ain’t no reason I'ma call it off
Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright
In the studio everyday
So you know this shit about to be a busy night
Everything is al-, everything is alright

It's Finally Famous over everything
RattPack gang
What up though, Logic?
Yeah, day one shit right there

Hold up, let me get my mind
Let me get my mind right
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright
You know everything is all

Oh my God, they plottin' and schemin'
Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'
They tryna take my blessings away
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday
And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got Champagne problems, and I order more
My wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up
Hype nigga, back-back-back it up
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop
That's the type of shit I boycott
Yellin' fuck the 5-0, state troops
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts
I got these good girls hoin' out
Tell me what the fuck you know about
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know about
Then they throw you in the game
And you mothafuckin' blow it out; now everything is alright

Hold up, let me get my mind
Let me get my mind right
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright
You know everything is all

Whippin' through Gotham
Hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off ‘em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain
But I be killin', 'cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela
Hit you with a Beretta, get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me
Probably wanna fight me
But I just keep the peace, no need to keep a piece
I keep my enemies on a leash, capiche?
And keep it real for the people I reach
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah

All day (all day), everyday (everyday)
We was on that block until we made a way (we made a way)
Day to day, man that's the only way (only way)
They gon' know my name until it fade away

Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Okay, okay)

I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit I run that
Motherfucker this far from a comeback, if one of us fall then we run back
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my kin, gotta get my son back
Cause when they coming through that system don't give a fuck about you (you, you, you)
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday
Driving to work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day
I know, I'ma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce
Never regretted, the second I said it I feel like I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder ya predicate, bitch I'm ahead of it, yeah
Yes I'ma die but I don’t wonder why in the hell I'ma ride in the dead of it yeah
I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable
Okay-kay, hold up let me say yes I fade away

Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Yeah, yeah)

Tell me what I wouldn't wanna give for a life like this, arm and a leg quite like this
Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this
I might just, might just, I don't know
Reinvention, that's my intention
Want so much more than this third-dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture
No metaphor, I’m being real with ya
But it will hit ya like, "goddamn!"
Going HAM, full of all of them
In a spaceship, I’m in another system
So futuristic, on another mission
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my life—no inhibition, life to death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when it's out the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'ma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'ma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away


THOMAS: Get the upgrade?
KAI: Nah, man. It’s the same shit with a different title!
THALIA: That’s not true, Kai
KAI: What the fuck?!
THOMAS: Yeah, man. They didn’t just upgrade features, they enhanced her A.I
KAI: So she can actually hold a conversation?
THOMAS: Yeah. Ask her yourself
KAI: Uh, what am I thinking, Thalia?
THALIA: Kai, I’m a program in the ship’s interface, not a psychic
KAI: Damn, girl!
THOMAS: Yeah, that’s another thing now. She’s unisex
KAI: What?!
THOMAS: Thalia, integrate Y chromosome feature
THALIA: Sure thing, Thomas. Would you like a standard accent or something a little more exotic?
KAI: Holy shit!
THOMAS: Told you, man. The upgrade’s crazy. Thalia, revert last command and run simulation
THALIA: Running simulation
KAI: Man, what the hell is that?
THOMAS: Well, you can pick anyone in history, and based off a collection of data, it allows you to personally speak with them
KAI: Anybody?
THOMAS: Anybody
KAI: Thalia, do Big Sean
THOMAS: All right, let me get this straight. You can speak with anyone in recorded history, like Jesus, Steve Jobs, Einstein, and you pick Big Sean?
KAI: Man, fuck yeah! That’s my dog!
THOMAS: *Laughs* Okay. Thalia, simulate Big Sean
THALIA: What up Kai, you lil' bitch?
KAI: Yeah, I'ma have to upgrade my shit
If you're dealing war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap)

Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare—I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, "'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne

Come some more into my sight...
I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corner selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door while gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn, you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't into fairy tales, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you've got a fucking problem bitch I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill 'em with kindness, yeah we leave ‘em deceased
And tell it like it is so now you got it, capeesh, homie waddup!

Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down

I hope you live a long life hatin'
Now watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
Rattpack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make it, shooting for the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, woah
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it Rattpack till the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mindstate celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they momma's
I rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic

Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down

Mmmn, I'm thinking...
Okay
Yeah
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad

This-this-this-this-this the type of shit they said they really wanted
So I gave them this right here, now go get blunted
Check my last album, all y'all know I run it
Flipped the script just 'cause I could and fucking stunted
This-this-this-this-this the type of shit my life is all about
Check the Forbes list, you know I'm ballin' out
They say, "Logic, you too humble, boy, just let it out"
Fuck 'em all then, I'ma dead it now
Like oh, I think I know, I think I know
This flow, this super flow, out of control
Like whoa, this shit like whoa, I think I know
Like whoa, like, like whoa, like, like, like...

This that flexicution, this is what the people say they wanted
From the young boy, from the—from the—from the god

I'm like...

Hold on, let me bring it back
Everybody know I'm bringing the facts
And they wonder why I got it like that
'Cause I put everything right on the track
And you know I'ma fuck around and let it go
I been living like woah, I been living, you already know
And these motherfuckers wanna take up on every mistake
And I'm showing where I'm going
And I'm knowing what I'm doing, intuition never switching
On a mission, motherfucker, why is you bitching? Why is you bitching?
Like God damn, I'm like (oh God)
Hold up, wait a minute, they ain't ready for the hook
It's another day, another book
I feel like Indiana in Atlanta, hotter than Havana
Coming with the stamina
Bitch, put down your camera, and live in the moment
This shit right here, everybody gon' want it, so what up wit’ it?
Any and everybody talk about the boy changing
Y'all can just shut up wit’ it 'cause I know
Ain't none of y'all getting the flow, boy...

This that flexicution, this is what the people say they wanted
From the young boy, from the—from the—from the god

I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it...

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
It's been a hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)
Hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
That I've been M.I.A, but I was tied up
Till I heard you talking shit, now I'm fired up
5-0 triple 0
Ayo, shout out to Black Diamond. I got them Nikes on my feet as we speak, homie. Shout out to Mac Miller

All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind (Sinatra)
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my grind
And at this moment in time, I’m on a road when I write this rhyme
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while he’s passed out
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out, oh my
Good god, you know we fly
Day dreaming out the window, watch how buildings pass me by
See I ain’t signed but at this point in time
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl
All I do is rhyme and get money, that’s my repertoire
Holla at honeys, "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?"
Baby what’s the deal, have you ever heard of some shit so real?
(Cudi what up?)

It’s going down, feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare

All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

This is the joint that when you hear it you like, "That’s my shit!"
Maybe at a house party while you getting lit
Or while you cruising 'round town riding in a whip
One thing’s for sure, you better get all of your friends here
If a shorty like my music, then she a (Bobbysoxer)
Got a booty, know how to use it, homie yes I rocks her
The second I jump on a stage, I’m rocking it, ain’t nobody stopping it
Whoever goes on after me, I’m sorry, you ain’t topping it

It’s going down, feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare

All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

Ever since I was a youngin I knew I’d break in the game
While you worshipped other rappers that leave you less entertained
I was strategizing before the people knew my name
Fame what I shall attain on the road to success
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain
Yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito
I know we fight, but that’s poquito
Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito

All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Okay, it's RattPack 'til my pulse flat, we keep it real, no false rap
I got four cards and they all black
Got four broads and they all that
We call that "ballin'", doin' this is my callin'
Flow is so appallin', my phone off and she callin'
I'm like, "Yeah, what it do?", penthouse, man, what a view
Fall back, 'cause I'm coming through
With my whole team, they coming too
That's real, too real, motherfucker, tell me how you feel
I'm too good for my own good, I won't leak the album, I'll let it spill
Number one, bitch, I bet it will, due to numbers, I said it will
I played the game and I'm still the same
And I'll never change, just to get a deal

Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin'
I came from nothin' to somethin' like it's nothin'
Yeah, you know I done it, nah, there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they'll never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know

I'ma live life 'til I overdose
While they sleepin' on me, that's comatose
I went mainstream with my main team
You just mad as fuck, you ain't come close
And ya' next girl is my ex-girl, she fine as hell, but she a mess girl
All I do is rhyme, I got no time, so I can't reply to your text, girl
Bitch I'm back again and I'll run it
Always gotta keep it one hundred
All of y'all know y'all want it, turn it up and get blunted
I'm like, "Fuck the money, fuck the fame"
I came here to fuck up the game, gon' get it, I'm feelin' myself
Fresh to death, bitch, I'm killin' myself; I'm gone
We burnin' it up, step in the building, we turnin' it up
Talkin' that shit, but they'll never admit
When I step to the mic I be murderin' it
And we livin' real good, mainstream, but it's still good
I got raw shit, I got real shit
But right now it's time for that feel good
We call that "ballin'", doin' this is my callin'
Flow is so appallin', my phone off and she callin'
I'm like, "Yeah, what it do?", penthouse, man, what a view
Fall back, 'cause I'm coming through
With my whole team, they coming too

That's ballin', ballin'
I came from nothin' to somethin' like it's nothin'
Yeah, you know I done it, nah, there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they'll never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know

Yeah, you know that we ballin', we been goin' all-in
Hold on, let me slow it down, so y'all get the shit
These haters talk, but I don't give a shit
Got models, bottles, and the piff is lit
But we ballin', kinda like Spalding and Rawlings
On the road to riches never stallin'
Got your girl all up all on my nuts
But she do it with joy, no almonds, ugh
Living life to perfection, VIP, that's the section
Presidential watch, presidential suites
You would think we held an election
It go Logic first, then I'm up next
I do not converse, I just cut checks
I do not rehearse, I just drop the verse
I need to cop a hearse, 'cause I'm fresh to death
I bet you never seen so much designer
Never seen a nigga with a bitch that's finer
Boy, I stunt when I ain't even tryna
Swaggin' is nice, but first I'ma rhymer
And I rep Maryland, home of the Terrapins
Say you spit crack, homie, we spit that heroin
Bring it right to your front door like I'm carolin'
Standing next to me would be so embarrassin'
Yeah, we be ballin'

Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin'
I came from nothin' to somethin' like it's nothin'
Yeah, you know I done it, nah, there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they'll never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know
Goddamn, goddamn—conversations with legends
Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus
Money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe than think down and leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack cooking where my sister be frying soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass—I'll kill him, I'll kill him
I'll motherfuckin' kill him
I said, I really want to kill him—but I can't
'Cause if I do po-po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it?
I grip the mic and then kill it—okay, I'm gone
As memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin’, sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little Bobby, just a youngin’, skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Can’t take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day I pay homage to the gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I’m from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon
Catch me rollin’ with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I’m De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like "Thriller"
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We don’t do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does (Logic)

Hip-hop

I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy—I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G—
—that's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number one—I better be
Bitch, I said, "I bet I be."
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me, how is they gon' remember me?
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just 'cause I was different
Just 'cause I was doing what I love?
And the fans they say they love you
But they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want
How they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs
Now they want another hundred
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry
'Bout bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger
And better from when I've begun
So when people that never knew me
They tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?
I just stop, and do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give?
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions
That shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending one must understand the prequel

I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

Spit it like Holy water
Prophetically repent 'em, then we gone
Yeah yeah, what up Bobby
Like goddamn, like goddamn
This that 9-5 shit right here
Take 'em back to the 90s!
Like goddamn, like goddamn
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo yo

Okay now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
Take them back to way back when, like Dennis the Menace
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant
Man, that's the definition of a life sentence
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce
Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs, man that's pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain't a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it
I'm, forever alone in my mind (yeah yeah)
See I'm a self diagnosed hypochondriac
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
Yeah, I know that I'm livin' like I got it okay, yeah
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah

Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

Ayo, fuck all that, it's the fat young Jesus; flow prestigious
Stackin' money and playin' the field man like Regis
Better believe us or leave us
Grabbin' your bitch's cleavage like, "woo-hah"
I went from surveyin' to Super Saiyan slayin' the man
Bitches want an autograph
I sign them titties in crayon, like goddamn!
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
It's me and B-I, B-I, B-I-G L-N-B-O, L-N-B-O
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie
I'm unscannable, young cannibal, eat wack MCs like Hannibal
Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal

Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious
The young Spiegle, interstellar with my retrieval
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval
I spit at it like a Beretta
You know I get better by givin' the people
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden
"The Return of the Jedi"
Bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do
This shit is (overdue, pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through)
The B-I-G L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio
Ay dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo
To hold a brother down like the white man
Fuck them, yo
Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff
Even in a pair of cuffs, know we always keep it real
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man
I'm just (301 reppin', second I step in Maryland)
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this
Throw a Molotov in your crib
And tell them bitches to bill us, we the illest
Finger fuck a critic
Shit is darker than "The Chronicles of Riddick"
Yes I did it, while they bit it, you know we got it
Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on
Living good, I've been living good
Rolling through my hood, understood
Just a youngin in this bitch up to no good
In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me
Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang, no, they know
We've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the fame)
We've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the...)
We've been at it way before the fame, psyche
Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit
No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do
Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue
I'm coming through
If I see your bitch I bet she coming too, what it do
We ain't never switch it up, we keep it true

Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
We've been at it way before the fame
(Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)
(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)

Back again, like I never left
Had to take a breath
Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore
God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam
They know who I am
Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce
Fuck it, make it count
With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa
Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla
It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross
Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl
RattPack, know the deal
What's the motto? Keep it real!
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it
We live in an era where they get deleted
I'm wondering if I'ma make it
Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it
These bitches they love it, but I never covet
I just keep it going that's why I be flowing
I'm already knowing this life that I'm living
Don't know what I'm given
It's so hard not to give in

Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
We've been at it way before the fame
(Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)
(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)

Locations where the album were recorded include: No I.D's studio in Los Angeles, Logic's house in the hills, and various hotels across the country throughout the duration of the tour...
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you’ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it

My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)

Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming, trying to convince me I’m not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but life’s not
And I'd be lying if I said I didn’t care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe it’s in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

(Oh my) Oh my
(Oh my) Like the white woman said oh my
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I don’t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah

Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don’t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I’m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(I said oh)

I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug

Go back in time to when my nigga daddy

Like the white woman said oh my (Oh my)

Oh my, my, my

Sometimes I can’t get you out of my mind
Baby, no I just can’t find, I just can’t find
Such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind, such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind
Sometimes everyday right on time
But right now in my mind
It feels like I'm living on borrowed time

I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me ?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not bout the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one

One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap
When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, accept Him
Tell me how you feel—
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna to be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I've been buried alive

Everything happens for a reason
People only in your life for seasons
Word to Aunt Viv (Real shit)
Death and taxes that’s all we given
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'
You can make it work but that still ain't driven
Give a lot but that still ain't givin
Livin' life like this ain’t real though
Every night like this I feel so dead wrong
Collision is head on, my vision is dead and gone
Perception of right and wrong
I been here so very long right here in this very song, uh
Look around everything changes
Seem like everybody just strangers
Don’t go outside cause it’s dangerous
Why everybody wanna be famous
I’m so OCD if they notice me
I might jump out the grave so they know it’s me
Man everybody want this shit for free
Hand out palm up when they get to me
In my mind no I never let it get to me
Everybody got a time, will it get to me?
V’s up motherfucka, that’s victory
Tell me why what I’m doing ain’t shit to me, damn

Buried alive (Buried alive)
Will I survive? (Buried alive)
I gotta know, I gotta know
It feels like I’ve been buried alive, buried alive

Tell me how you feel—
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna to be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I've been buried alive
(Let it breathe)

I'm feelin' this villainous feelin inside of my mind
Every time that I’m willing I feel like I'm killin' my dreams
When that voice goes nah, nah, nah
Listen up now, love it or hate it
Never debate it, you can never degrade it
While all these other motherfuckers
Probably thinking I made it
My mind jaded, no—I never evade it
I elevate it just to keep it innovative (innovative)
God damn, bring it back now, blowin' up like Iraq now
RattPack put me on the map now
No, we never back down
Just take my time, I just take my time
I know, I'mma get it like this
So everyone know that I did it like this
Yeah, I know—I'mma take my time
Battle the image inside of my mind
I know, I'mma keep going
Tell me I can't but I'm already knowing
I know, I'm gonna rise even though I've been—

Buried alive (Buried alive)
Will I survive? (Buried alive)
I gotta know, I gotta know
It feels like I've been buried alive, buried alive

Tell me how you feel—
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
(Let it breathe)

OutKast, A Tribe Called Quest, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and films by Quentin Tarantino were in rotation constantly throughout the duration of this album's creation...
It's the type of shit that they read about
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with Kid Cudi and B-I-G
Conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant to me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again cause I love this shit
Write it down and they publish it
I went 5 years without a publicist
'Cause the word of mouth, they in love with this
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming
Went away a while but I've been fiending
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal
Been at it way before the deal
Now the  music got mass appeal
My main girl got ass appeal
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing
Little fish, that went mainstream
Now I'm big as fuck
My whole city, they know what's up
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit
I don't give a fuck
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt
If I'm talking business, I might erupt
If you're at the show, put your lighter up
Fuck with me if you're really 'bout it
Outsiders, I could do without it
I crept in, got slept on
Sold out shows, no one knew about it
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it
Your cosign, I could do without it

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na...

Okay, last verse I gotta make it count
Won't speak on my bank account
So many commas I'd have to pause
And I can't afford to just waste the bars
Every day, boy, I thank the Lord
I got a lot of problems but could have more
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less
I been hungry like Budapest
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck
I just know I'm blessed
Love life even though I'm stressed
This business boy, I swear a test
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check
I'll send Chris to go cut they neck
I love the building, no disrespect
But y'all better ride when I'm in effect
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet
If y'all fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist
I'ma intercept. It's my time
Put half a mill of my own money in this album
That's my dime; no rap features, just my rhymes
My story, it's all mine, from the basement to the stadium
From the Roxy to Palladium
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that
With this pretty girl on my floor
Half naked playing Connect Four
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window
Just to connect more
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind
And then unwind with some slow head
All my homies like "go 'head"
Anyway, it's been a long time
And this here has been a long rhyme, so I gotta go
It's Logic, the one nobody would vouch for
How's that shit for an outro?

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na...
This is my story, 'till the end
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na...
This is my story, 'till the end

Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah Yeah...

"Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them!
They may be misinformed about the truth, they may be misguided— somebody has led them on the wrong path!
A path of corruption and destruction! But yet, God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved..."

Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah Yeah...
Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah Yeah...

This concludes the Under Pressure program...
It's 2 bars? Aight...

Motherfuckers wanna get famous bust guns and get dangerous
(dangerous)
Daddy graduated from Cambridge, money talks in every language
Real recognize that stainless, silver spoon what my aim is
Y'all don't know what that game is, y'all don't know what that, uh
Y'all 'bout that fraternity life
If you're from where I'm from then as soon as you come
Baby girl gon' be about that maternity life
If you do like my daddy then she gonna be single and alone
That maternity life for eternity life
Eternity life probably thinking we livin' that life
Cause we do what we do, but hold up let me get it right
Everybody got problems, everybody got problems
But not everybody need a .45 to solve them, revolve them (ba-ba-ba-ba)
Take care of all of them like this, I might just go crazy all the way
Y'all live that life where your safety is only a call away
But not us, mommy and daddy never bought us
Not a god damn thing but they brought us
Broke as hell we couldn't fund the trust
Outside run around with a gun to bust
Police looking for every one of us
Back then yeah all of that was fun to us
Had a little bit of money in the middle, let me hit 'em with a riddle
If I never had a dark night I might not-not-not—
Not be the same—might not be the—

I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over

Ay, hey now boy?
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town
South Central with the gang, gang, gang
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat
Get the fuck up off your silver

Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average
They cutthroat yeah they savage
They riding round with the baddest (bitch)
One day I woke up, and said I'm bout to do this
For the rest of my life, no question it's right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light
Looking at the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies, where the truth dies
And hatred multiplies—mu-mu-mu-multi—
Multiplies, I said I can't take it
I remember wondering if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around, so the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate
And when the situation's delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no, I can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen?
Stop spending money on things that glisten

I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over
I Know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over

Ay, hey now boy?
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town
South Central with the gat gat gat
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat
Get the fuck up off your silver spoon
Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me
All that competition right there is dead to me
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous
Boy, I've been feeling courageous
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes
Everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it, uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it
But right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it, I'm gone
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it, I'm gone

Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude
I look out of the window like goddamn, that's what I really do
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I wish to sustain
If I look back on it I would do it all over again
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor
Crazy, racist, white bitch looking at us
Like, "Who are these niggas?"
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam
Oh my God, this is my jam
"May-December" by Mos Def
In my headphones, that's the man

I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high

Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own
These thoughts inside my mind
Be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit
You know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought
Hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive

I can't believe you don't like Tarantino
Ugh, I don't like him because, like—when it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie—
You mean like Inglourious Bastards?—I didn't see that
What?!—I didn't, I don't know—
Oh my God! Have you seen 'Pulp Fiction'?
Yeah, but I don't really remember it
What you talking about? Have you seen uh... this is funny cause we're on a train... have you seen—fuck! What's his name? The guy from the movie, in the place, on the thing?
On the train? With the scenery?
Uh, I'm tryna remember right now, dammit—'Source Code'!
No—You haven't seen that?
No—With the dude from 'Donnie Darko'?
Who's that?—Oh my God
Well, I still wanna know what your favorite Tarantino movie is...
My favorite Tarantino movie—?

I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high

I'm lappin' in this luxury by nappin' in a big ass house
Chillin' with my homies on the West side, West side
Bringin' out my best side

From London to Paris, yes it's very extraordinary
Fuck around and took the bus and a ferry

Then we made it back home like woah
Tell me how you're feelin', higher than the ceilin'

I gotta hold my own, know that's the only way
I've been vibin', let me guide em, I said I gotta know
I've been ridin' for so long I think that it's time to go
Feeling like an addict that ain't had it, up and at it in a minute
If it hadn't been invented, my limit wouldn't be infinite
I'm feeling like an infant in a womb, I'ma be here 'til the tomb
Lately I've been in my room
Lookin' and lookin' at records on the wall
Hold up—

My net is 30, my record clean, my flow is dirty, right?
Real G's move in silence like—
Who the common denominator?
Fuck around and bomb a hater
My flow greater, heart darker than Darth Vader
Check the data, matter of fact, check the state of mind
After I'm finished, these rappers ain't in a state to rhyme
Straight to your mind now
Feel this shit like it's some Braille
Way too heavy for the scale
All I know about is bars, like I couldn't make the bail
It ain't never room to fail
Only growing and prevail
When my anxiety rise and I feel like I'm in hell
Take a moment and inhale
Count to five then exhale
Then we run that motherfucker like a marathon
Hits, motherfucker, hits, yeah we 'bout that Barry Bonds
Brace yourself, you can't retain me
All that shit you talkin' out your mouth just won't sustain me
Logic pickin' up the slack like denim
Spit it with venom
Never pretend to be somethin' that I'm not
And you ain't shit when you stand next to me
No kiddin' like vasectomy
Step to me, throw disrespect to me
And I'll rearrange your trajectory
Black and white like a piano and I'm proud to be
And fuck whoever tell me I am not allowed to be
I am me, I'm a man, can I live?—Goddamn
Yeah, I guess this shit right here is just all a part of the plan
Haters gon' hate, that's the motherfuckin' sayin'
So much plaque up on my wall I need a dentist
From Maryland to Venice, this shit is worldwide
Step up to the mic and it's a homicide

Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"

Everybody wanna tell me what I am, what I am not
"You ain't black, you a mothafuckin' white boy
Shut ya mouth, do it right boy, a'ight boy?
Man, why you such a hype boy?"
"Why you always talk about being black?
Skin too white, nigga fuck that"
Everything you talk about, cut that
That door you trying to open, you could shut that
Grip the gat, yeah that’s how I’ma buck back
Tell me what I am and what I know now
All this prejudice has got to go
Life is moving fast, it need to slow down
Come and see me when I am in yo' town
Practice what we preach before it go down
Practice what we preach before it go
Yes, I got the gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the?
Masta deep down inside of me
The plantation deep down inside of me
Everybody fuck like sodomy
'Cause one or the other what it gotta be
Tell me why my momma gotta lie to me
Unity for everyone that lied to me
Peace on Earth what I try to be
I just wanna spread the message of equality
And yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the gat?

Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"

Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that, right?
And I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn’t be shit!
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
For every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and, and all this
Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
But spend four, five, six hours of that
Working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No-no!
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy
You ain’t never experienced that shit
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there
Oh no, no, we know, we weren’t there
We didn’t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
Of what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black)
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah
And he’s here to say:
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior, fine
Just stop killing each other
I wonder what it feel like
To do that shit in real life
And now I know I got it
That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted
But it's still Visionary till the death of me
Yeah, I'm trynna make it but I gotta find the recipe
Greatest of all time, I want the world addressing me
At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressing me
I'm trynna stay focused, I guess that's the lord testing me
I knew as a child, that this was my destiny
They do it for the limelight
But I make sure my rhyme's right
Waiting till the time's right
Smiling at my mom's like
Smiling at my mom
Smiling at my momma
Moët what we sipping now
We was never tripping now
We on private jets, in other words, that means that we tripping now
Cause they was over there, I was over here
They was too scared while I was facing my fears
I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer
That's why I compete with legends, motherfuck my peers

I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

They said I couldn't do it
Back when I was broke going through it
Till I got a deal, now they talking 'bout "I knew it"
But you wasn't there in the beginning
Nowhere to be found when I was down
But you show up when I'm winning
Uh, left me to drown, now I'm swimming
I do it cause I love this shit
Fuck the money, and the women, and the-
And the whips with the rims still spinning
I been at it since the beginning
All these girls screaming "Logic"
But I wanna hear my real name
Come from the lips of a beautiful woman, that's real man
Y'all act like I'm Superman
But I can feel pain
I shoulda gone crazy, and yet I'm still sane
Love it when they sing to us
Been shining what's bling to us
Yeah, over here
It's only been a year
I was dirt broke, now I'm balling like a sphere

I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

Now that I'm in the limelight
They hit me all the time like (Logic, you never call me!)
Shut the fuck up, ho!
Let me get my mind right
Cause this is for the fans
Who truly understand
Real all the time
All of y'all my fam
Shooting for the stars
And I ain't finna land
Giving everything I can
While they tell me I'm the man
Making music is the plan
Matter fact, you can call it plan B
Cause I kill these rappers while they're in their infancy
And I be first to pop off -  infantry
Gotta keep 'em in line like symmetry
We all fam, same root, smokin' different tree
And all these people in the crowd sound like a symphony
Uh, to my ears
I love it when they cheer
On the road to success, these haters in my rear
I got nothing to fear
Cause the whole team here
And everybody shouting (What they shouting?)

You the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Everything is fine, everything is so fine
Everything is fine, everything is so fine
'Cause I’m good, so good
'Cause I’m good, so good, so good
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, this is my life
This is my all, this is my all
And now I’m happy, right now I’m happy, but sometimes

“I’ma make it some day some how” what you telling yourself

Infinite power and a pocket full of wealth

People in the street going ape shit
Battling depression but nobody wanna say shit
I'ma bring it back to the basics
I'ma bring it back to the basics
I'ma get up, get on
That’s what I been on
Fuckin' with your mind, tryna turn shit on
But they want to paint me as a villain
Even though I’m here to open their mind
Through the rhyme of life
I gotta open their mind and design the right time
To make a decision and get in 'em like an incision
'Cause I'ma hit 'em and give 'em livin'
They wonder what I’m giving, I'ma never give in
I gotta let everybody know
I'm in their mind right now

I’ma get up in your mind right now
Make you feel like dying right now

Why nobody wanna say:
Everything will be ok
I'ma bring it back to the basics
Everything will be okay
I remember somehow, someway
I remember somehow, someway
I remember somehow, someway
I remember somehow, someway

It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of one’s body
I’m not here
I’m not me
I’m not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It can’t be anxiety
It can’t
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah, of course
I’m so in control of my mind and my body
But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
I am scared, I am human, I am a man
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Cause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No, no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you, the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
And live with anxiety
I know that you think this song is for you
I used to long for you and adore you
My life was just fine way back before you
Now when you reach out I just ignore you

Cause this ain't a love song (woah)
This is, "So long"
You did me so wrong for so long
For so long, for so long

No, I never thought I could live my life without you
All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you

And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said, I doubt you
I doubt you even know why I left you behind

I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars

This ain't a love song (woah)
This is, "So long"
You did me so wrong for so long
For so long, for so long

And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said I doubt you
I doubt you even know why I left you—

Yeah, uh, yeah...
Much love to Def Jam, even though they under shipped me
Did me like Bobby did Whitney, but the fans was with me
Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album
But black vs. white bullshit was the still the outcome
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go?
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow
Who gives a fuck who made it? I penetrate it and innovate it
While they emulate it, give a fuck if I'm hated
I'mma do it 'til I get it, fuck a nominated
Bitch, I dominate it
Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Not many get to do what I do, and now enemies
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me
But let's get back to the music, I'm gone
Outside of this solar system, I'm searching for paradise
Livin' the life, bitch, I've been a vet
Fuck all these cats on the internet
I love hip hop and I hate hip hop
Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot
Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sakes
Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break
Now, I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game
We all people, all equal—now let me let off, yeah
Now let me let off
Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone
Switch flows, fuck 'em up—play the game, run 'em up
Yeah, I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck
All the people want is real, guess that's why Logic appeal
All the power in the world; hold that, tell me how that feel?
Racism on television and magazines
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn
Country don't give a fuck who I am
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand
And I am, here's to the Roc
The .45 Glock that my older brother pop—shot
And I am, finally on top; too high up, not a drop
Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap
I am, livin' like I ain't got it
Spit the flow so robotic, man who gives a fuck about it
Maryland 'til I die, but I had to get the fuck up out it
I love it and hate it, you probably don't know, man, I doubt it
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be

Real shit goin' on in Lebanon
But I don’t give a fuck, my favorite show is coming on
Hashtag pray for this, pray for that
But you ain’t doing shit, get away from that
Blame it on a black, blame it on a white
Blame it on a gun, blame it on a Muslim
Everybody wanna blame him, blame her
Just blame it on a mothafucka killing everyone!
Everybody wanna get high
Everybody wanna live life like they can’t die
Everybody gotta be right
Everybody scrollin', scrollin' through they life
I wish they would love me like I like they pictures
I wish I had bitches
I wish I had motivation to get money
Ain’t it funny, my rainy day would be sunny
If I had the vision of currency fallin' above from the sky
Fallin' above from the sky, listen up
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen
Everybody think that the meaning of life is, life is
Everybody, everybody, woo
Everybody think that the meaning of life is

Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed

Oh, I know it’s hard, I know it’s hard like
I know that’s the reason you turn up at night
Livin' yo' life, just livin' yo' life
Can’t nobody tell you how to do it right
Come away with me, come away with me
Let me take you from this world of insanity
Come away with me, come away with me
Far away from flying bullets on this killing spree
Oh, I know, I know
It’s hard, yeah, it’s hard, yeah, yeah
I know it’s hard sometimes
It’s hard sometimes

Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed

Yeah, I've been killin' this shit
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit

Yeah, I've hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah, I've flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this

Let me tell you 'bout the young man
Matter of fact, I'ma let Push tell that
Tell you 'bout the old man
Had a change of heart and then fell back
Old man lived a long life
Walked around with a long knife
You ain't cut the white like Jesus
That Colombiana, that's mi hermanos (YUGH)
Look at the flick of that wrist
I'm feelin' like Leonardo
Let me paint a picture, I might need a bottle
On the road to success, I could feel the throttle
That Michelangelo, hundreds in the envelope
Tight shit when I write shit
And that old man had a change of heart
Wish he knew it back from the start like goddamn
Looked around, seen his wife on the ground
Military bussin' bullets all over the whole compound
Soon as he seen it, I swear it, I mean it, my members go quicker than vamonos
He dead, she dead, he in jail
Everyone fallin' like dominoes

Yeah, I've been killin' this shit
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this
Yeah, I've been, yeah I've been killin' this, killin' this shit
Yeah, I've been flickin' that, flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've been killin' this, cookin' that
Killin' this, flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've killin' this shit
Yeah, I've hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah, I've flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this

Simple logic
Clockwise, counterclockwise, realest nigga in the top five
Other four ain't rap niggas, I'm just reppin' for the blow side
Yuugh, that's coastlines, Panama for the boat rides
Worth billions, and we ain't even need Showtime
Just money counters and kitchenwear
Condo with a bitch in there
Two scales and baggies, we got rich in there, woo!
The Rollie's been the trophy since Hawaiian Sophie
Curry over Kobe, we shootin' niggas
Splash brothers with the coca, add in baking soda
Goodfellas to my niggas (Yuugh) all Ray Liottas
Shades of blue, I aim at you
Let the sky fall, let it rain on you

Yeah, I've been killin' this shit
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist

Yeah, I've hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah, I've flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this
Me and my team gotta intervene
What's the point of living if you ain't living a dream?
We live in a world where everybody want everything
Everybody want a better thing
Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing
Man, the game been waiting for a better king
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming "Money ain't a thing", cause it ain't
Man, I never knew that living out a dream
Meant living out a suitcase, I've been working at a new pace
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
Drop hits, get money—run it

What the fuck is there left to talk about
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen
Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen
Boy, this been my house, this is merely an addition
Fuck 'em and their permission, they was killin' the game
Who the one that gave 'em remission?—you know the name
Who else you know on the come up, do it like I does it
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I was workin' on a budget, second time around shit is different
Cause they know that boy good, know he does it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating
They can suck my dick—run it

I'ma do somethin' different for the last one
I'ma go in...

Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey
On an Interstellar mission in Chicago
At the bottom of the Riviera
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era
I gotta beware of the people
But I take care of the people
When I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
No, we ain't never acquainted
On the rise like a defendant
That was charged with possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision
God damn, can you feel it?
Uh, I had a dream I would run the game and kill it
Had a dream, can you feel it?
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
Get up in it, make the shit infinite
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant
No never when I slide up in the spot
Just a youngin' in the game
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back
That was the mentality, never truly reality
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation
Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em
I'm too tied up, this a ransom—
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding
Couple years back you ain't give a damn
Autographs off the plane whenever I land
All part of the plan, anything you wanna do you can
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em
Be above it unless you're thinking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact, you should take a step back—cause I run it
Living life like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money
My bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back

Cause I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

So what now? (So what now?)
Let's get down—let's get drowned, on this vision
My division is the greatest that's around
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
This is where I'mma be for as long as I'm alive
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this
They say "what's your motivation?"
Cutting these records like back in the basement
Boy fuck a vacation, we do this for love, not no validation

Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

Wanna get it like this
(I think so) when I'm driving
(I drink slow) when I'm vibing
(You never know, know, know, know) (Lets go!)
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic
I don't smoke but she love to smoke
And look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?
Shit girl I know that you want it—but fuck all that
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me
Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Grip the mic and I go (Whoo!)
Fuck around with this flow (I know)

Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

Making a single before your album is like putting together a trailer for a movie you have yet to shoot
East side, west side, we ride, we die, everyone knows
Everyone knows, everyone knows
East side, west side, we ride, we die, everyone knows
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Tell me what you know about forty days, forty nights
No lights, all for this
Tell me what you know about sleeping outside
No ride in the wintertime, all for this
Tell me what you know about commas in the bank
Lookin' in the mirror, yeah, I did all of this
X you out, you get solved with this
Everybody know I...

I'm a slave
I'm a slave
You a slave (Yeah)
You a slave (Alright)
I'm a slave for this shit
I'm a slave (Yeah)
You a slave (Alright)
I'm a slave
You got to slave for this shit

Walk inside of Def Jam
Step on the president table and dap 'em up with the left hand
'Cause I'm countin' money with the right
In a different city every night
And I'm sellin' records like it's white
It's another day, another flight
Paris in the morning, L.A. at night
What a beautiful sight
Now tell me who be fuckin' with me, alright?
Everybody know I'm livin' this life
Everyone know I got the baddest wife
This shit right here, everybody gonna like
Hold up, I know what I, know what I like
Tell me why everybody in the pipe
'Cause I'm the only one doin' it right
I'm a rap genius like Rob Markman
Spent a couple of million on my new apartment
Down in Manhattan, that's a multi-million dollar view
And I got it from rappin'
Damn everyone nappin' on the boy, heh, shit
I'm not a mad rapper, but what?
I'm angrier than Kanye
Angrier than Kanye when he talkin' about clothes
That's a fashion line
And my last album went number one
So what that mean?
I did better than you, you, you
Sold way more than that pop bitch
And I dare Def Jam to drop this
I just drop hits
Check the Instagram fam
I got fifty-thousand people in the crowd, singin' out loud
Every word, that's every lyric
You can hate, shit, just stop actin' like you don't hear it
This shit right here for the party
That album that comin', that's shit for the spirit, woo!

5-0 triple-0
Okay now, this how I'm feeling, lately I'm like the villain
Cause while they on that other shit
I been posted, out here chillin'
Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5
You know this that shit that you bumpin'
In your whip while you drive
I've been living life and I hope that you do the same
Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame
Come on I've been through the game
'Bout time that they know my name
Numb it down for the pain, this music my Novocaine
Lord willin' we overcame, it's time to get over man
I've been around the world and back
And I swear it's all the same
And what I learned; a prophet don't do it for the profit
Gon' get off, check the topic
Watch me drop it, can you top it?
I don't know I've been at it on the low
Never did it like this here before
But I'm still here and I just hope
I'll make a difference, make a killin', Lord willin'

Lord willin', make a difference
Lord willin'—uh, Lord willin'
I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
And so I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
So I tell em—

I guess I'm back at it; I ain't done, I ain't had it
If I was underground before then this is me in my attic
For this rap shit I'm an addict, but can't fuck with that dramatic
I've been busting my ass, they probably think it's automatic
Yes sir, I've done this shit before
Like your baby momma momma
I'ma tell 'em like it is, I'ma tell 'em like it is
Life ain't picture perfect, we use the negatives to develop
I'm well up, I'm way up
Nothing but net, fuck the layup, I'm way up
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions
Can't fuck with they delusions, I'm on that 101 cruisin'
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way
But no not quite like this, living like that
In a way, guess you could say made me wanna write like this
Not quite like this, on my level, I'm unique and I'm a rebel
Like you listening? I hope that you're listening
This feel like it's summertime; waiting for the bus
Number nine, through the city all alone
Not a worry, not your phone
We just vibing, maybe flying 'round the world
Man, I hope you see the world
And all your dreams will unfurl
Just don't never cash your pearl
Go out there and make a livin', take this advice that I'm givin'
Make a difference, make a killin', make a killin', Lord willin'

Lord willin', make a difference
Lord willin', Lord willin'
I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
And so I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
I don't understand what's happening
So I tell em—
Yeah, maybe this should just be the intro, like this
That's it, squad, bitch

All these bad bitches say they love me, I already know
Check the, check the bling that's on my finger 'cause I'm married, ho
There he go, everybody know that boy's pockets is swole
What's good? That sound familiar, never been here before
Life good, 'cause I just got quoted two hundred a show
Oh no, oh no, two hundred a show
Overnight, all this money that I've been makin', I gave it right back
To all of the people that made me, you know we like that
Don't know why your bitch wanna date me, but I can't fight that
Guess you ain't done shit for her lately, not on the right track
If I think that shit sound good, I gotta write that
Weed man knockin' on the door, I'll be right back
Pass the shit to 6ix, watch him light that
Hit the studio, record the shit, then mix the shit, then master it
And then we do the show and they recite that
Bitch, I'm right back, told 'em 'bout my life, told 'em 'bout my life
Told 'em I was broke as fuck too many nights
Now I see my name up on so many lights, but everybody prolly think this shit done happened, happened, happened

Overnight, people think this how this shit happened, but they never right
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that
Hustlin' the streets like they trap over–over–overnight
People think this how this shit happened, but they never right
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that
Hustlin' the streets like they trappin' and burnin' (woo, woo)

Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
All they ever do is hate the boy, but now they know the name
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
All they ever do is hate the boy, but now I run the game
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
You can hate now all you want, but shit won't ever be the same
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
You can hate me, but I'm not the reason that your life is lame

Tell me, is it really so hard?
Really so hard, to be a good person?
Tell me, is it really so hard?
Really so hard, to stop acting like a bitch? (woo!)
I treated everybody with respect and now I'm rich (woo!)
I treated everybody with respect
Maybe you got issues with your daddy, though
Maybe you was bullied back in high school
Maybe you are just a tool

Maybe you're the reason, you're the reason
The reason I don't fuck with nobody, and
Maybe you're the reason, you're the reason
The reason I came up with nobody, and
Maybe you're the reason, you're the reason
Everybody think this right here happened

Overnight, people think this how this shit happened, but they never right
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that
Hustlin' the streets like they trap over–over–overnight
People think this how this shit happened, but they never right
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that
Hustlin' the streets like they trappin' and burnin' down, shit

And I know that they talking, can't fuck with the tone
Talkin' shit 'bout Logic, I never respond
I'll let success talk, 'cause a word of advice:
More achievements for yourself and less talk
Cats beef with Logic, yeah, they prayin' I respond
If I ever did, I dead you in this game with no respawn
Peace, love, and positivity, that's all I want with you
But you push the issue 'cause I give you more press than your publicist could ever get you
Hell nah, fuck rap, fuck beef
Anyone that hate me, I wish you success
I wish you look in the mirror and ask yourself why you suppressed
The feelin's of self-hatred that you want project on me
Bet if I never picked up the mic then we might be homies
But you jealous, you look at my life and you feel envy
Constantly comparing yourself to me and feel empty
Most people that don't fuck with me ain't never shook my hand
I'm a good man, yeah, I love myself
I know who I am, yeah, I love myself
They don't understand
But no matter what happen you know that–

Can't nothing stop me, I'm on a roll (I'm on a roll)
Always on time 'cause my eyes is on my Rollie-olex (woo!)
I don't trust nobody, oh no (no, no, no!)
I don't trust nobody, put my homies on the payroll
Fuck with me now or you'll never know (never know!)
If you weren't with me, in the beginning, you get no love (no love!)
My name Bobby Tarantino (Tarantino!)
Logic ain't here right now, leave a message if you want, ho (leave a message, ho!)

Hi! It's uh—Logic? Hi, sorry. It's Elton John calling you! Um, I hope you don't mind me getting you on your mobile–or not getting on your mobile, but I was just, uh—congratulating you first of all on your performance at the Grammys and then I was asking you—I was gonna ask you if you'd like to do something for me, and I will ring you back later and see—and talk about it, thanks!
Somewhere this shit done got crazy
I've just been driving Ms. Daisy
With my hands on the steering wheel
And my eyes on the pavement
I give a fuck 'bout where they went
I owe my lawyer a payment
They talking 'bout no arraignment
Now I wonder where the rain went
I just been all in my mind, homies tell me I'm stressing
I been counting what's on my bucket list
And not on my blessings
I think it's time for a lesson, hold up, you better pay attention
I can't end up like my momma popping anti-depressants
My therapist think I'm crazy, well, shit, she probably does
All that stress I'm under, I wonder why I don't do drugs
Raised in a household full of killers and thugs
Shit, I've been in doubt so long, don't know who I was
But I know who I am, yes, I know who I is
Please pardon my grammar, Daisy vibing with this

I've just been driving
I've just been driving
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy

That Bino the realest, uh, this beat made me kill it, uh
Her feet to the ceiling,,she said that she love me
She never said that in college,,3005 is our mileage
I'm in my lane like a Prius, because I'm moving in silence
You still ain't broke down yet?
All the flashing lights and a couple Crown Vic's
Wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left
Tell your nigga speed up, she don't wanna get left
Relationships look closer in that rearview
Finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you
So now you gotta stop, park, put that shit in neutral
Yeah, you really love her, but is she worth your future?
Your Ciara, your Beyoncé, they'll be saying he got money
Think that Kim be with Kanye if he left drive in the driveway?
Yeah, I know who you are, yeah, I know who you is
We were driving together, when we met we were kids
You ain't know 'bout the biz, I ain't know 'bout it either
I see you in that new ride, I flash my lights when I see you
I just be driving

I've just been driving
I've just been driving
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy

Turn left on West Deer Park
Doing ninety on the highway
We gon' do it my way
I said, ninety on the highway
We gon' do it my way
Uh, I said, ninety on the high
Ninety on the high
Ninety on the high
Ninety on the high
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
I've just been driving Miss Daisy
Uh, yeah, outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin'
And the police they rushin'
Go to my head like concussion
I'd rather not have this discussion
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood
Where my mind, don’t know now
But I know where it was
I need Nikki, where is Nikki
Baby girl please come and get me
Now I’m old and shit is trippy, but I know that God is with me
This that baby mama drama
Give a fuck about a man I know I'ma
Be there for my son, talking with my sister it begun
End of the month, that’s the worst of the month
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
That welfare check, check
Won’t ever bounce like my daddy did
But I’m glad he did cause it made me strong
Made me help somebody with this song
Paint the picture of my life
Growing up what it was like
Section 8, grab a plate
Food for thought, gravitate
Food stamps, social services tryna take me away
My mama locked up, I pray to god that I see her today
Maybe not, maybe so, West Deer Park that’s all I know
Just me and my homies, people that know me
Only ones that know
Around my way, living day by day
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs
Five-O with them K-9's
Manhunt when it's game time
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
Now I’m running from the police
Don’t know how, but I got away
Selling weed to my homies
And a girl in the building that know me
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I’m breaking into school
Cause my homie told me to
What to do, what would you?
When will I lose my anonymity
And become one with the enemy?
Tell me would I be the enemy
Feel like nobody in front of me
I can feel the vibe

Bobby what are you thinking?
What are you dreaming about?
Bobby, what’s inside?
What are you thinking right now?
What are you thinking?
Go to sleep

I guess maybe I was thinking things would be different now
Cause when I wake up my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes
I wish I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen, maybe never
Maybe so, I got to know—but tell me why
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons?
Maybe not—All I know is this life I live
I can’t live it no longer
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive
Turn on the TV, let it wash my brain
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain
Hello children, how was school?
It was good, how bout you?
I love you (I love you son), I love mama too
Are you ready for dinner?
I’m able to set the table
Till I snap out the fable when that TV turn off
And I realize I’m back in hell (Bobby...)

Logic has recorded 1700 songs in the span of his
10 years as an MC. However, only just over
150 have been released to the public...

This is beyond the flesh, this is beyond the flesh
This is from the soul and for the soul
This is for all my brothers and sisters, for all my children
This is for every race
This is for every color, every creed
Music does not discriminate, music is made to assimilate
Black is beautiful, black is beautiful, and so are you
Strollin' down the highway, I’m strollin'
And I was strollin' down the highway
Strollin', strollin', strollin', strollin'
I was strollin' down the highway
With my mind ablaze
Strollin' down the highway
For days and days
Strollin' down the highway
With my mind ablaze
Strollin' down the highway
For days and days and days and days

Hello?
I know, I know, I’m supposed to been home, I’m coming
Just, I’m on my way home, every time
I’m on my way there right now, okay?
Oh shit!
Life, what’s it all about?
What? Wait, where am I?
The space between spaces
Beyond time and existential intelligence
Forget, fuck all the hippy shit, where am I?
What’s the last thing you remember, Atom?
I was in the store, I bought some smokes
I came outside, the phone rang, I...
How do you know my name?!
You were walking home from work when you died
Died? Dead? I’m dead? I’m dead?!
It wasn’t an act of courage or bravery, but it was your time
What do you mean it’s my time? What? I got...
What about Vanessa? What about the baby?
Your wife and son? You see, that’s what I like to hear
You find out you’re dead and the first thing you worry about is others
Man, answer me, what about my family?
What’s going on with Vanessa?
They’re doing just fine
You see, your wife was cheating on you
Wait, wait, the bitch did what?!
And even though she loved you dearly
She was a bit relieved you would never find out
Wait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?
How you gon' tell me I’m dead then gon' tell me my wife cheated on me?!
Atom, none of that matters now
Walk with me
Wait, what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?
No
Well, I don’t see no pitchforks
Little red people runnin' around
It ain’t too hot up in here so I guess this ain’t hell either
I think the easiest way to describe it, this white void
Is to look upon it as a waiting room
So...are you God?
Yes, I’m God
You—you, you
You—you, you, you, you, you
You, you—you
You—you, you, you, you, you
You—you, you, you, you, you
You, you—you
You—you, you, you, you, you
Warm it up, warm it up
Warm it up, warm it up, warm it up
Warm it up, warm it up
Warm it up, warm it up, warm it up

It's that Young Sinatra shit, yeah, this that Young Sinatra shit
Shut the fuck up and listen whenever Young Sinatra spit
Yeah, your girl fine as hell but she a Young Sinatra chick
Hey Bobby, how can you tell? She on the Young Sinatra dick
All these rappers wack as fuck, make the Young Sinatra sick
RattPack be the squad, that's that Young Sinatra clique
Goddamn, said this the Young Sinatra clique, goddamn!
Listen, yeah—I’m visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Step to me, fatality; yeah, this shit is my galaxy
I am who the baddest be, I'd rather be at the academy
Killers, I'm be glad to be me, magnify the shit like bifocal
Motherfuckers talk on the internet, but in person they never vocal
Come to the hood and fuck you up if you prefer to be local
I'm loco from Noho to Soho
Gettin' cheese like a photo, you know, ho
I'm blessed like Sunday, flyer than a runway
Lil' Bobby never second-guessed that he gon' make it one day
One–way or another, my brother, word to your mother
They should give me a badge 'cause I'm always under covers
Goddamn! I'm a miraculous man!
You know I get, I get it, I get it, I get it
The Young Sinatra spit it, rewind it, and rip it
I could murder your whole album with a 30-second snippet
Pass the Mary Jane like I'm runnin' a train with Peter Parker
On tour, I have more sex in the city than Sarah Jessica Parker
The deeper and deeper I go, it get darker
They say they want the old me, they want the Young Sinatra back
The one that murder it, rip it up, no, never givin' up on the almanac
Yeah, I'm all of that, fall back, like September again
Baskin' these rappers so hard they won't remember again
When it comes to hip-hop, bitch, I'm indigenous to this
It's apparent I'm bearin' down like a parent
When the beef is at stake, I'm Mastro's
My god-level lyricism surpass flows, I'm much more than fast flows
Money, talk, cash, hoes, greatest of levels–I've passed those

Fuck that rap shit, this that trap shit (Bobby!)
This world is my contraption (Bobby!)
I was born and raised in the trap, son (Bobby!)
Talk shit, get kidnapped, son (Bobby!)
I don't really know why I rap, son (ay!)
Money in the bank, yeah, I got some (ay!)
Couple sports cars, yeah, I bought some (ay!)
Logic never flex, Bobby get it done! (ay!)
Yeah, y'all don't really know where I come from (come now)
Talkin' that shit, I'ma come for 'em (what's good?)
Tell me what you really know about me right now
Anything I want, I get it somehow

Fuck that trap shit, this that rap shit
Give me the hand like John the Baptist
Ready to rip it, I hope in the captives
Greatest alive like I'm Cassius
I put 'em all in they caskets, they can't see me get past it
I'm a bastard that mastered the flow
And none of y'all ready for the massacre, though
Fuck with Logic? Yeah, that's a no
Matter of fact, it's not impossible, just highly improbable
Like, saying the police isn't robbable
But I'm liable to walk up in the station in blue-face
Like, "Fuck the police!"—Blue lives ain't a race
Fuck whoever said this rap shit was never a race
This shit a marathon
Murder you motherfuckers and carry on
Claimin' that you really 'bout this shit
You got your Jim Carrey on—
Liar Liar; I might crucify ya
Number one 'til I die, will never retire
I am the Messiah, I am the god of this shit
This is how we do it—yeah, I started this shit
Yes, I started this shit like–

Fuck that rap shit, this that trap shit (Bobby!)
This world is my contraption (Bobby!)
I was born and raised in the trap, son (Bobby!)
Talk shit, get kidnapped, son (Bobby!)
I don't really know why I rap, son (ay!)
Money in the bank, yeah, I got some (ay!)
Couple sports cars, yeah, I bought some (ay!)
Logic never flex, Bobby get it done! (ay!)
Yeah, y'all don't really know where I come from (come now)
Talkin' that shit, I'ma come for 'em (what's good?)
Tell me what you really know about me right now
Anything I want, I get it somehow

You—you, you
You—you, you, you, you, you
You, you—you
You—you, you, you, you, you
You—you, you, you, you, you
You, you—you
You—you, you, you, you, you
Get ‘em!

Living life on the East Coast
Way back in the day trying to beat most
Anybody that wanna do what I do
Well let me keep it one hunnit with you
It ain’t about that; ain’t about Hip Hop, ain’t about Rap
Take a minute, hold up, wait, now use your cap
Chicago, know I’mma snap
Nah, this ain't no basic rap

And so they wonder who am I—so high (so high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high

Back again, never outside so I’m acting in
I laugh again when they don’t understand
What I mean, bias; everybody seen by us
Everybody wanna live a life like this
Man fuck that, do what’s good for your family
Make music like there’s no Grammy
For that last line they might ban me
I don’t give a fuck though
'Cause I am me, from Beijing to Miami
I’mma just do what I do with my crew
Ain’t no telling what I’m finna do
But I promise that I’mma keep writing for you
And I know what to do, everything right here for you
Only for you, depending on what you gon' do
It’s all for you—it’s all for you

Who am I—so high (so high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high

Let me take this time to find the rhyme
And know that I’m the only one
To find the one, the time is done
Beyond the sky, beyond the sun
There is no one besides the only one
And you know I gotta let ‘em know
If you love it, let it go
At an all time low and all I know is, all I know
I do what I love, came from below and then rose up above
Created a world no one has been to
Everything that I’m into, everything that I’ve been through
Bring it back like, let it shine like a Bat Light
Reminiscing on that night, gotta take flight
Everybody probably wonder what I’m living like
In the middle of the night I might write
Despite what they say is right and wrong
Despite they wonder (wonder)

Who am I—so high (so high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high

We’d like to be painters, we’d like to be poets. We’d like to be writers, but as everybody knows—we can’t earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that—and uhm—forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time...
You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid! It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you’re doing, it doesn’t matter what it is—somebody is interested in everything—anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are...
But, it’s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don’t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See, what we are doing is, we’re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living—in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life, by bringing up their children, to bring up "their" children, to do the same thing. So, it’s all retch and no vomit—it never gets there. Therefore, it’s so important to consider this question...
"What do I desire?"

Clear skies—

Kai, which Tarantino film do you think Logic liked best?

I would definitely have to probably have to say Kill Bill

114 feet—

Man, stylistically he’s like—what’s the name of that bitch? The lead character? I forgot her name, but he’s like that bitch—with like some Kung-Fu shit he’s like with his raps. It’s fucking crazy!

You know in—in Pulp Fiction I mean—the way Tarantino constructed his shots, it’s the same feel for me with his raps you know? There’s thought behind it...

No, I could see that, I could see that but...
But nah man, fuck that man! Kill Bill was the shit!!
Especially like knives throwing and dodging and shit—and then fucking hot chicks fucking fighting each other and cutting each other’s heads off! What the fuck is that?!

Yeah, fuck it—

Prepare for surface landing!

You’re right, hot chicks and Kung-Fu, can’t beat that...

Yeah, can’t beat that at all...

Are you ready for this?

Are you?
(sounds of birds chirping, air, etc.)

Wait, wait—what's that sound?
(sounds grow, then abruptly stop)

Life...
Watch my back, so I make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday, the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me...

Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

Yeah, I know we seen a lot of shit whole time we've been together
Thought we knew it all but just couldn't predict the weather
I think about you and imagine a house and some kids
And wonder if you found another and it's all his
See baby girl, I know you love me even through the lies
Cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes
Sometimes I see you when you love it but you fear it cause you try your hardest to run but still feel me in your spirit baby girl I know you hear it
My heart is calling for you tonight
And even though the time is wrong I know the love is right
That's why there's so much emotion whenever I recite
Anything about this angel that lost its sight
Baby you were my everything, but you playing games
Fucking around got me feeling like blowing my brains
But you ain't worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action
I used to count the days with you but now I just subtract them

Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

You were my best friend but then you out me
I never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me
So in the end it only shows that you don't give a fuck about me
I know you hearing the emotion that's deep in this letter but I don't give a shit about what you think
I write it so that the people can feel better
That have gone through what I've gone through
Memories of a perfect love that's broken and haunt you
And if you think I write this song to taunt you
I don't want you, I want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday
And have an endless love with an angel from up above
But now it would seem my baby girl has fallen
And another path within my life is calling
Cause I put everything below you, (everything below you)
Even my music, and when you left me I didn't lose it
I channeled deep within my emotions and used it
My heart you broke it and bruised it
So now I address this microphone and just ooze it

Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

Watch my back, so I make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday, the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me...
I am the greatest
(Someone with power, someone with power)

You fuck bitches and get money, that's wassup
It's all good, but all these people do not give a fuck

Everybody come and get up, get on
And no matter what you fighting for I promise that it’ll live on
Like make America great again
Make it hate again
Make it white
Make everybody fight
Fuck that
Street’s disciple
My raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like Cobain
And everybody wonder why the world insane
Why the world insane
Why the world insane
Why the world insane

Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

The world going mad over one drug
I'm filling up a bag at the gun club
In the shadow of a nation that it once was
All this false information I'ma unplug, young blood
It is not love, up at TrumpThugs, dot gov
The man in the high castle in a hot tub
We locked in a pine casket, it's botched up
Like plastic surgery, classic perjury
The way they can plead the fifth to the 13th
And stop to search me, controversy
Them boys in the klansmen hoods is thirsty but hey motherfucker

Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

Young blood, it takes another look and feel
Slap that fear monger at that wheel
Olive branches in the arrow seal
Alternative facts mean to lie and steal
Gotta to go to ban the whole
Refugee population from the land they stole
In the name of the government
Rich white man while the rest be suffering
Run from the locked down borders
Ain’t like Flint ain’t got clean water
Dirty politics never come clean
Can ya'll believe this shit in 2017?

Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my dick

George bush don't care about black people
2017 and Donald trump is the sequel so
Shit, I'll say what Kanye won't
Wake the fuck up and give the people what they want
Man it's all love but the youth is confused
Your music is 20/20 but them political views
Is blurred I ain't trying leave ya name slurred
'Cause honestly I idolize you on everything, my word
But I gotta say what need be said
'Cause I ain't fuckin with that hat, with the colors that’s white and red
I know some people wish I’d act white instead
Say I’d use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead
Fuck that, everything I do, I do it right
To teach the people that they have the power to fight
And not with semi automatic bullets in the night
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact
Nobody treated equally, especially the black
If you don’t get it the first time, bring it back
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites
To make it happen though we gon' need patience
And not violence, giving hospitals more patients now
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop
I'm just as angry another person got shot
Don’t be angry at the color of they skin
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and
I’ma tell you what I need right now
I’ma tell you what we all need
I need my people of color...
Don’t run from Trump, run against him

Hey mothafucka I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

Ohh, hands up for the 5-0
Oh, ohh, hands up for the 5-0

I been in the cut, liquor in my cup, 38 tuck
I don’t give a fuck, I don’t give a damn
I just wanna live, I just wanna eat
But I gotta do it for the hood, do it, do it for the street, uh
Dope in the trunk
Creepin out the cut
9 by the gut
Never get enough
I don’t give a fuck
Stupid mothafuckas move backwards
Mastered the hustle
Something in the duffle for you bastards
Grind over chatter
Cheese on my mind like a packer
Only thing that matter, bitch scatter
You in my way, about to spray, the A-K
Middle of the day, like that shit’s okay
Never had a job, never had a education
Only know probation
Never had a job never had a education
Yeah, I never had chance in this world, I never had one
No, I never had a chance in this world, I was labeled a bad one

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now send the blacks back to Africa
Build a wall for the Mexicans
Send the whites back to Europe
Give the land to the Native American
Take the skyscraper
Tear down the casino
Print your own paper
And bear down on the gringo
Take the skyscraper

Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my
Various listeners is wishing us death
Don't give a damn, I'm reppin' Young Sinatra till my last breath
Easily my darkest confession is lyrical agression
Through indiscretion that triggers anti-depression
When addressin' my profession in every session
The fact that I'm alive is such a blessing
Sippin' wine while these honeys undressin'
What I'm about to say is highly confidential
And in the music industry today, very essential
So bust out your pencil, you can do it on your own
Stop thinking that these labels is the ones that put you on
Let's change the topic, who's your favorite rapper?
I'm the top pick, ha
The flow is elegant, never irrelevant
How many times must I say this?
Cock back and spray this, never delay this
I pray this, reaches the masses
And spread like cancer on they asses
Now allow me to catch wreck, bust rhymes like tech
Put me in your box and I destroy the deck

(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

Whipin' through Cabo in a Murcielago
Dodging paparazzi with the finest dime I met in Chicago
The baddest Bobby soxer that you ever seen, reppin' my team
We real all the time, so my squad keen, bing
Dave, it's me Sinatra and my boy Dean
The way we (winning) I can't believe there isn't a Sheen
And pregnant women listen and they give birth to a fiend
I spit narcotic epidemic all up in your genes
In layman's terms I disperse a verse you never seen
Assassinate rappers the moment that they intervene
While you in the alley playing dice
I'm in the yacht contemplating plans for the next diamond heist
Art thieves and jewel connoisseurs
I study every part of they mind and make my rhyme better than yours
Elevated by being hated, sleeping on the brother like they heavily sedated
Some say I'm one in a million, I say I'm one of a kind
Only cocky when I rhyme, I'm Muhammad in his prime

(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

Yo, Address the mic and start spillin' like I hit the vein
Back in the day they used to sleep on me like Tryptophan
Touchdown now the city screamin' my name
I flow gunshots and break fingers just to shift the pain
Whoever hate ‘em, I levitate 'em like David Blaine
Black Ops state of mind, play the game like campaign
Bumpin' Santana in a finest Copacabana
In Havana with a honey by the name of Hannah
Wearing nothing but a bandana
Pussy wetter than Louisiana
You know the deal, peace to Miilkbone, I keep it real
Flyer than a man of steel, motherfucker how you feel, It's Logic

I woke up early on my born day, I’m 20, it’s a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body
Now I’m fresh and my physical frame is celebrated
Cause I made it one quarter through life
Some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it’s pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don’t go against the grain, simple and plain)
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

You ever wonder what it all really means?
Heart full of dreams?
I know I'ma do it, go get it by any means
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention
You say you would if you had the money
Don't make me mention
That it'll cost nothin' but time for you to pay attention
Now don't get me wrong
I know there's people out there hatin' on ya
And it feel like your self-esteem is breakin' on ya
All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak
They spend seven days preyin' on the weak
I know the world sleepin' on ya like a sedative
Talk all you want about me homie, I'ma let it live
Hater this, hater that, say I sound repetitive
Hatin' in your blood, you was born to be negative

Never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

This is dedicated to everyone that never made it
And the people that persevered even though they was hated
They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion
But on the real the road to success is prone to collision
And every now and then something happens
That's unexpected, like that newborn in your life
Because you fuckin' unprotected
And I swear nobody perfect, hell I know I ain't
Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint
Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can
Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man
Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow
Teach 'em everything I know
Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe
And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong
But I had to do it all just so I could write this song
I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son
And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun
Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one
Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run
While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one
Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one

I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right you
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

Um, you like that take? I like it
Yeah, should I make it more surreal though, or...
I think it's good, hey Bobby run it!
Church, yeah
Now this that—
Yeah, yeah

Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious
I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born out of wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock
Got my sites on deadlock
Visions of my enemy in a headlock
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble
Just a youngin' in trouble
Took a shot and then made it a double
Took a shot and then made it a double
This that food for thought, my school ain't taught me good
No ingredients in my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda
Gon' make it good, like it should
That's ignant isn't it, hold up wait
Now take a look at my pigment
Tell me again, we can never be kin
Based on the color of my skin
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin
That's a club I don't wanna be in
My DNA get done integrated
My God it's innovative
That's a million miles away from administrative
I fuckin' hate it, anyway—
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive
Police would knock on the door, I would hide
Then they would talk to me and I would lie
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
Over down on the driveway
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that "My Way"
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now I'm a grown man, oh man
What the fuck done happened to the plan
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy (crazy)
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep (why)
Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker
Wide awake on the creep tryna kill you and he will too
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel
My son, my seed watch 'em grow and then watch 'em lead
Let me proceed, bumpin' that Californication, by the Red Hot
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC

Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise
Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise

I remember my life long ago in my adolescence
I could feel the presence in my residence
Hesitant even thought it was evident
I should get the fuck—
I know something is wrong
Yeah, I know something is wrong
Feel like my mind gone
I know I play along, I might drown in this song
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed
Shit maybe then I'm noticed, huh, but maybe not
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious
So outrageous my age is on my mind
Walking to work and I go blind
Sippin' on that Koolaid
Gettin' big wig money, that's toupée
Look around and see people with no class
Like snow on a school day
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu
Livin' life how I do is crazy
This shit never amaze me
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why
All I know is my mind racing
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it
Yeah, I be pacing, bitch I'm back again
Been here since way back when
Now let that shit begin, yeah

This album 2 but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise

This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming "I knew it!"
This is real, so real
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill
Most of these people will never hit fruition
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle
All alone with no one to dial
I'm just a man, I got problems
Understand, this is all I ever wanted
Yes, I do it for the fans and I ain't perfect
I've questioned if this life was even worth it
'Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now

This album 2 but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise
Yeah, yeah, SlayDro!
This that J Dilla right here
Badu, Indica Badu
Yeah, that's right...

Riding 'round the city with my homies, blowing trees
Wavy like the Seven Seas, living life, let me get it right
Let me give it a minute to get up in it like a beautiful independent woman that's finna make you wait to smash
Come now, let me count this cash
Come now, let me sip this flask
Pockets fat like shawty ass
Jump in the whip, gotta get this gas
Put that shit in drive, I'm live like ammunition
No permission needed, I proceeded to accelerate
Had days with hella hate, but gotta let that anger migrate
All this shit that's on my plate
That food for thought that can't be bought
But only taught, and on the real know

I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher—

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nigga, like we smoking all weekend
And I roll and smoke when I'm drinkin'
Tell them open that door but don't peek in
We be havin' a OG Kush meetin'
If we smokin' that dope, it's a reason
Eyes so low from the chiefin'
I be getting high when I wake up
And roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping
Man, I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past
It don't even come to my house
If it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag
We roll up the herb and laugh, kick back, blow a zip
Take it on a plane, know I smoke the same when I'm on a trip
Nigga like me always got weed on 'em (got weed on 'em)
Try to tell me that she don't smoke, later on she joinin'
Ain't no point, no I'm back, keep going in
You been rolling with cats, who boring
I be bringing them stacks enormous
Section always in the back important
Bad bitch gorgeous, pack imported

I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher—

Uh, yeah, I'm finna get up in the feeling
Independent feeling like a boss
Roll a little something, smoke a little something
Kick back and then floss
Chiefin' that Indica in the cut, tell my anxiety to get lost
Fuck a pill, only numb the pain
Man, you know how much that shit cost?
I ain't talking 'bout your pocket
No, I am only talking about the mind
When the cannabis combine with the brain
It be like everything you see, it seem to shine
Smoking that Golden State, everything going great
Got a lot on my plate, not a single complaint
Stack of money in the bank
This that RattPack and that Taylor Gang
They know the face and they know the name
I'm a married man with a bad wife
Never fuck around unless it's Mary Jane
Come play the game, honestly never the same
Just like my flow, got one for every occasion
Living the life so my life is amazing, woo

I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher—

Yeah, and if you don't know by now—I smoke weed!
"Hahahaha," how Wiz gonna give me the verse
He ain't gonna give me the laugh though?
"Hahahaha," that shit iconic
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Indica Badu
Aye, let me just rap...

I've upgraded while they've waited
Will they love it?, Will they hate it?
Never faded I evade it
Cause I never really want to complicate it
Think I've made it, yes I did
I'm giving them bars like a bid
Let me rewind it like a vid
"Did he just say that?" Yes, I did
And they really wanna get it like I live
God damn mother fucker what I gotta give
Way back in DC, at Liv
On the way to that everlasting life
Will they rob you? Yeah, they might
Hold up, wait a minute, veer to the right
On this road to success, I've faced my fears
Then hop on that flight

I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded

My bitch bad got a sick figure
Play 1 show and get 6 figures
We build bigger, money tall as a mountain, bitch
I've got Hilfigers, like goddamn
Yes sir, I know who I am
I'm that main man Martin, out here kicking out Pam
Just riding 'round with my Gina in that all-black Beamer
All the way from Maryland whipping out West Covina
Hold up, now check my demeanor
Yeah, your girl bad, my girl meaner
I've upgraded

I've got the Akira on the wall
I just can't follow their law
Swear to God that they know me
They don't know me at all
And its all right, it's alright
I've upgraded

Let me bring in them new kicks like Timbaland
I gotta reboot with this upgrade
My metaphors on Cloud 9
And the meaning behind them is so vague
Before I created this universe
I had to fly through the Bermuda first
6ix on the beat, then we queue the verse
Now I'm in another world when the flow emerge
Feel like I'm in a Fifth Element
I'm in my element lost in paradise
Its me, you and Leeloo, Korben Dallas in Fhloston Paradise
Never by chance like a pair of dice
I don't give a fuck about their advice
I'm on another planet, no I'm not manic
Bitch I'm decompressed, know they can't stand it
Cause I pilot it and manned it the best
All they demanded was I gave up and laid dream to rest
(God damn!) Hold up, wait a minute; fuck all that shit
I left Earth ages ago to avoid and duck all that shit
You know when we on
Making music that's gon' survive for eons
Bloodshed from America to Sierra Leone
That's that shit I can't be on, that's the reason I be gone
Yes, I keep it professional like Luc Besson and Leon

I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
I've upgraded
Sometimes I fantasize about traveling space and time
I think about specific moments that I could rewind
Not to redo it, but relive it, I could give it one more go, abide
And truly understand the deeper things
That I don't know about
Now take a trip with me and vibe
I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive
I'm gonna take this moment right now
Here and school them people
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people
Truly wish that I could, check it
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world
I see like different light, this music shit just ain't the world
Brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters
All different colors and creeds all come together for me
Boy, I'm blessed to be free, uh

This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind

Doing 70 on this highway
On the front of this bus, I'm busting my mind open
Hoping these lyrics will keep me coping
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit
It's been like 3 months since I've been home
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it
Let me bring 'em back
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever
My endeavor like a feature film
Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?
I'm in it, my limit the chillest
Let me bring 'em back, yo
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing
But I'm testing, reminiscing
When I would listen to my intuition
And now I made it, resurrecting
Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated
It seem like everyone's somehow related
Letters back and forth from my homie
That's locked up in prison
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in
What if the tables was turned
And I was the one that been in, damn
He said he's seen me in the magazine
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel
That's been my dog from the kennel
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
Skipping class with all of my homies
On a constant search for who I was
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
I never graduated but I made it to the summit
Don't get me wrong, so many times
I thought that I would plummet
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem
To stomach all of the beef around my way
I mean, I never wanted to live a life
Where all you're truly living is a lie
I knew I always wanted more
And so they wonder why, I said they wonder why

This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind

So what do you think about space?
Um, space is called the galaxy...
Do you know planets?
What are—can you name some planets off?
Yeah, there's a one named Saturn and Earth
Mars—and the planet Paradise
You've never been there before?
Um, no. I was little a long time ago with my mom riding in the coolest ship. My TV showed us where we are in space—
But there was droid ships everywhere...
Well, thank you for your time, sir
I appreciate the interview...
Yeah, yeah
The tunes on here? That shit sound good
Bryson gotta hurry up and send me this verse
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Bitch, I've been blowin' up (bitch, I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'? (in the beginnin')
I know that they showin' up (know that they showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin' (when the boy winnin')
No, you do not know enough (you do not know enough)
You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin' (life that I'm livin')
You've never been low enough (never been low enough)
Yeah, I was born at the bottom (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything I'm given now
Bitch, I've been blowin' up (bitch, I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'?
I know that they showin' up (know that they showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin'
No, you do not know enough (you do not, you do not, you do not)
You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin'
You've never been low enough (never been low)
Yeah, I was born at the bottom (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything I'm given now

Copped that G-Wagon right there for my shawty

You've never been low enough (never been low)
Yeah, I was born at the bottom (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything I'm given now

Let that bitch breathe
Most of these people can't never ever comprehend all the shit that I've seen
I am polite than a mothafucka, but when I grip that mic I get mean
Come now, you know what I mean
Pepe done got the boy lean
Yeah, you could doubt me, say what you want 'bout me
But I am a rappin' machine
I do this shit for the team, shit for the squad
I'm livin' the dream, yes, I am livin' the dream
Hold up, wait up, just can't believe
Just can't believe that my swag is on another level
Yeah, I keep it G
Matter of fact, I keep it, I keep it, I keep it, I keep it M
Turn that shit upside down, now it's a W
No, no, ain't nobody fuckin' with him
Don't matter who come stand next to me
Once I'm surrounded ain't nobody fuckin' with them
I am the best of the best, of the best
Of the best, of the best, of the best like, Men In Black
Greatest alive, bitch, I've been that
If you don't agree, you get kidnapped
Bitch slapped, thrown back, like woo!

Yeah, get it like, get it like, get it like, get it like me, nah
Handout, palm up, you cannot get this shit here for free, nah

You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin'
You've never been low enough (never been low)
Yeah, I was born at the bottom (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything I'm given now
This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life

Yeah, I've been fiending for this moment
I've been dreaming 'bout this moment
I guess this is how it feel to have everything you ever wanted
Writing these records like a dissertation
While the fans goin' crazy from anticipation
Damn, nine years that's a lot of patience
And now I'm looking at my idols and feeling adjacent
It's hell of a long way from back in the basement
Looking at hip-hop tryna find my placement
I bought my first pair of Jordans at 22
Same year I bought a crib too
Now my face in magazines I used to flip through
And my music on all the sites I used to sift through
Remember meeting Nas for the first time
Shook his hand and he started quoting my lines
Said he a fan, goddamn this is my time
I'ma get it, I'ma do it till we prime time
I told him every single day that I be at it
In the studio recording like an addict
He said that real hip-hop shit I had it
Thinking to myself, "Damn, man, you made Illmatic"

This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life
I used to wonder what it feel like

Aight, I guess we back again
With another verse about how much I'm black again
You don't like it blame God for the packaging
Bringing up my race, don't call me a white rapper then
Damn, they judging me by my skin tone
Instead of my talent, man these motherfuckers been wrong
But it's all good I just thought I'd address it
And spell it out for people so they can finally assess it
This is dedicated to anyone with a dream
And a realization of what following it means
Breaking the cycle and not following your genes
That perfect moment when your logic intervenes
And let you know that everything ain't always what it seems
But if you really looking, I promise you'll find your dreams
This is everything I ever wanted, half of y'all won't get it
The other half will probably laugh and wonder how I did it
I just spit it from my mind, one word at the time
Take everything I'm going through and put it in a rhyme
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a lot of weight upon my shoulders
But this is my therapy as I flow this
Spilling out my heart, I just hope somebody notice
I've been real from the start and you motherfuckers know this
Once my name elevated that's when the fame escalated
But on the real, I've grown accustomed to the stares
People watching every move I make like it was theirs
All up in my business, and even in my personal affairs
Now, I know I talk a lot of game, but I ain't trynna sell you
Cause honestly, I could show you better than I could tell you
And even though there's been moments when everything have fell through
We kept it moving, assuming even the greatest fail too
I swear this business shit is do or die
I never contemplated suicide, I'm too alive
In front of thousands, but I'm talking like it's you and I
And everyday fewer find their dreams because fewer try

This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life

Everything I seen, made me everything I am
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
Throw your hands in the air, stand behind mine
Everything I seen, made me everything I am
Stand behind mine
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine

Said, welcome to forever
Welcome to forever
Welcome to... forever...
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Cannon

It’s funny how your role model gets outdated, becomes the old model
At the hotel, asking for mo' bottles
Ménage et plus one - I’m fucking fo' models
Wordplay that elevates minds like Aristotle
Murci-lago, whipping through Chicago
All these beautiful women follow wherever I go
Million-dollar deals on the table
Just a couple years ago I couldn’t pay for cable
Growing up surrounded by 'caine like I was Abel
Shit was unstable, now Visionary's the label
Plus Def Jam, know who I am
I’m that motherfucker that do it just ’cause I can
Now I’m on a level that your elevator can’t reach
I’ve got information that the school system doesn’t teach
I've got verses that your Sunday service wouldn’t dare to preach
Second-coming-of-Christ flow, they like, "Whoa!"
Rapture you with lyricism, kidnap your soul
And changed your mind like I’m penetrating your skull
I seen shit John Lennon couldn’t imagine
Just me and a mic on a main stage, spazzing
It’s the type of shit normal people can’t even fathom
So much swag, kiss your bitch and she orgasms
I’m hazardous, you would have sworn I was from Nazareth
I’m resurrecting hip-hop like it was Lazarus

Step to the mic and they gon' dread it like Weezy
Man, this industry is so damn greasy
Swaggin' on the track, they say I sound like Yeezy
But I don't give a fuck cause gettin' money too easy
21st century, doing something mean to it
Play this in the south and everybody gonna lean to it
"Greatest of all time" has got a nice ring to it
We do it for the music, money ain't a thing to us
Been shining muhfucka what's bling to us
Most loved, most hated at the same time
Star player in this bitch and it's game time
Who you know lyrically killed the club in the same rhyme?
They call me Logic, motherfucker, better know the name
I spit crack like Pusha (Yuugh!), Novocaine
We never dumb it down, you know we just numb it down
And watch you get up in your feelings when we come around
Grew up on section 8, you probably can't relate
‘Cause y’all just watched the throne, I’m tryna checkmate
I been shinin since before I brought them diamonds in, and
They talk that shit, they talk that shit, it’s so astonishing
Y’all better swallow that pride like a klonopin
Cause I can lay tracks with my eyes closed, Chinaman

Got a show in LA Sunday, then New York Monday
Looking at the BET cypher like I’ll be there one day
It’s the Roc reincarnated, we call it Visionary
Fuck the world ’til I’m on top, we call that missionary
The game’s on pause, it need to load again
These rappers is reruns and we need a new episode again
Yeah, well motherfucker, this the pilot
So fly I recorded this on the PJ next to the pilot on a CB
Now you see me on the TV
Said this would happen back in the day but you ain’t believe me
So um, I'mma keep rising to the top
Never stop and finger fuck the world ’til the day my album drop
You already know what I been on
You know where I be at
Cause men lie, women lie
Numbers don't, I see that
Catch me in a private jet
Like fuck it where the weed at?
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass
You know I need that

Now these bitches say they love me, but they're just obsessed with the image
Now if practice makes perfect then this is a scrimmage
Cause I ain't perfect, I never said I was
But now they're hating cause a brother finally got some buzz
The things that I say (Say)
The places I'm seeing (Seeing)
The people I talk to you don't know what I mean
Even matters of love, it ain't always as it seems
Yeah there's plenty in the sea until you hit the mainstream
The girl that I love, the one I call my honey
Now I wonder if she love me for me or my fucking money
Sometimes I think about the love that I had in the past
I truly miss it but it just wasn't destined to last
Cause our separation lit a fire under my ass
And now I'm gunning for the throne yeah that is my task
Just a youngin' with a dream, that acquired a team
Motivated by bad bitches and rockin' supreme
Now the whole world wonders what's his next move
That all depends on what I feel that I need to improve
Tell me what you think of me I swear it doesn't matter
Just as long as I am happy and my pocket's getting fatter
Just watch me shatter the competition
Getting madder then all of them wishing
You couldn't done it like I done it bitch I run it, Ah!
Yeah you know I do it like it ain't never been done
Hit the Vegas strip and blow a million euro just for fun
To be honest I may have embellished that last line
Chillin' with a shorty that is so much more than fine
At the penthouse poppin' bottles of that hundred thousand dollar wine
I got the connect, met 'em through the grape vine

You know what I been on
You know where I be at
Cause men lie, women lie
Numbers don't, I see that
Catch me in a private jet
Like fuck it where the weed at?
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass
You know I need that
You-you-you know what I been on
You know where I be at
Cause men lie, women lie
Numbers don't, I see that
Now these bitches say they love me
But they just obsessed with the image
You know what I been on
You know where I be at

Yeah, it's been a year and everything I said would happen, has
New school style with old school bars like Alcatraz
Cause I ain't never second guess this music shit
I knew this shit was all I ever wanted, all I ever had
Born famous now it's just time to convince the world
Ditch cats, like drainage if they disrespect it don't step through
I paint pictures for your mind and bring it to life like cinematography
Say it then I do it my whole career's a prophecy now
Better grab your jacket, cause in this world we live in it's cold out
And when my album hit the stores it's sold out
Like these rapper's careers
I'm the sum of our fears
Fuck a Grammy nominated bitch, I made it and I'm here
I said it's all about the fans, not all about the record sells
They said it wouldn't work, I told them go fuck themselves
Why you think I'm independent visionaries never fail
Why-why you think I'm independent visionaries never fail

You know what I been on
You know where I be at
Cause men lie, women lie
Numbers don't, I see that
Catch me in a private jet
Like fuck it where the weed at?
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass
You know I need that
You-you-you know what I been on
You know where I be at
Cause men lie, women lie
Numbers don't, I see that
Now these bitches say they love me
But they just obsessed with the image
You know what I been on
You know where I be at

"You gotta realize, a lot of the time when I talk
And I'm talking extremely cocky, I'm not talking
About myself, I'm talking about the work."
You know here I be at (be at)
Fuckin with me now, fuckin with me now

Did it all without a plug and so they fucking with me now
Yeah we've got it now, yes I've got it now
So I gotta keep it real right now
Tell me how you feelin', bitches grillin', we making a killin'
The villain chillin', I'm livin' the life I've got the feelin'
For the realest on the rise, shootin for the sky
VMG fuck all them other guys, been advised to give up
We live up to the bar set, bobbysoxer doin 120 in a Corvette
Blowin' up like a war vet
Goddamn, everybody wonder who I am
Cause I came out the cut like a stitch in your hand
And, my music flowing through your city like drug money
Made a mill off rap, fuck drug money
And now you hit me like I got you whatever you need
But deep down, hope a motherfucker bleed, yeah they

Break it down for these motherfuckers thinking that they

Fuckin with me now
Break it down come off of the crown
Nowhere to be found on the come up now they come around
Talk about they hold me down, yeah?
Acting like they know me, now they know me now, yeah?
Where you been?, you gon' be there when I need a friend?
Say I've got em when I hit rock bottom and get up again
Sippin gin, now would you pick up the pen
If I was locked up in the pen?
Tell me can you reminisce on way back when it did begin?
When I look at you, I do not see a friend
When I look at you look at me
I can tell you only see some type of end
Fuckin with me now, actin' like we kin
But you don't know where I've been
Goddamn, bring it back again yeah
Back again yeah, bring it back again yeah
Back again yeah, back again yeah

Fuckin with me now, fuckin with me now
Break it down for these motherfuckers thinking that they
Fuckin with me now, fuckin with me now
Fuckin with me now, fuckin with me now
Yeah, smoking in London while the snow fall
In another country so pardon me for the roll call
Damn, who would've thought the fan base was this immense
On the first fucking train to Paris so pardon my french
Shows sold out, fans in line even though it's cold out
Yeah, touring Europe getting swiss cheese
Many said I'd never attain it now I'm like, "bitch please, what up?"
Allow me to open up the verse with something so diverse
Now let the flow immerse, hold up; watch it disperse
Visions of Biggie, Big L and 2Pac just looking at me (Biggie)
From the gates of Heaven while the police booking at me
Open your mental while bitches give me brain with no dental
Y'all probably think I'm crazy for touching this instrumental
Shout out my cousin Ego, he know this shit's sentimental
Been doing this shit for my dogs, holding down the kennel
My ex hit me talkin bout she wanna make up
But on the real, I got no time for cover girls
Music is my main bitch, no time for other girls
I'm finna blow like Hiroshima, my demeanor get meaner
Watch me elevate to arenas
Me without the mic, that's like
Martin without the Gina, Venus without Serena
Now these thirsty bitches on the dick, we call that Aquafina
I used to bus tables until them tables turned
And everything I have obtained is everything I've earned
And everything I rap about is everything I've learned
So hopefully the listener can position a situation where they don't get burned
And they can learn from my mistakes, like I've learned from the greats
To do whatever it takes, for Heaven's sakes open your mind
This shit's one of a kind, elegant and refined, irrelevant to the swine
What's the deal?
Whipping through LA in the coupe de Ville, on the real
To various people I do appeal, because of skill
So this the type of shit I'm gon keep making
That make MCs break fast like flapjacks and bacon
Rest in peace to BIG, and many other fallen soldiers
Never Hollywood, I'm grounded like a cup of Folgers, bitch I told ya
Allow me to open up your mind and mold ya
Indulge ya, within this shit I call the second Renaissance
The system broke and they sent Logic in for maintenance
Cause all you wack rappers couldn't break change to make sense
I'm back again with another argument about how much I'm black again
Fighting for credibility from the lack of blacker skin
It's kind of funny how your pigment determines how people perceive you
That's ignant
Ain't seen my momma in a minute
Cause growing up she called me a nigga
That would never amount to nothing
Racism from my own momma, left home cause of drama
But I can make it in the rap game, look at Obama
You ain't been in my shoes, you don't know my story
You don't know what's in store, but bitch I stocked the inventory
Fuck a critic with the balls to try to tell me how I feel
You wasn't with me as a child
Never once did you feel the pain of my stomach
That manifested from the lack of meals
Headed to the soup kitchen on foot by the lack of wheels
We aim to keep it real
And hell no we ain't never missing
Came a long way from eating when government gave permission
If you think these lyrics ain't deep, you too stupid to listen
Just an outkast with a mission to spit to whoever listen
Bitch it's Logic!
Aight, well—higher probably, right?
Fuck it, just record it. Who cares?
One, two...

I just wanna make these music lovers remember again
While the haters fall back like September again
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again
Drop the politics and bring us together again
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then, yeah, yeah
But I'm not defined by the sales of my first week
'Cause in my mind, the only way I fail: if my verse weak
As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
Compiled of different races, gathering from different places
I just contemplate, shout out to those who can relate
And even though it gets hard I know my fate
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates, it's like

I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Looking for the sun in a world of gray
Feeling like my dream is a world away
I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Searching for the sun in a world of grey
Feeling like my dream is a world away
What it feel like?
I used to wonder what it feel like
Yeah, used to wonder what it

I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like

You can really do anything
You can really do anything
You can really do anything
You can really do anything

Hello. Welcome to the 'Under Pressure' program
My name is Thalia. I will be here to assist you with the information about the album and its creation
Logic

I got a date with destiny
My heart says yeah but can’t convince the rest of me
I tried so hard to make it with no recipe
My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me
I need redemption no need to mention my past
Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash
The glitz, the glamor, the lights, the camera, the action
The stage, the fans, the speakers blasting
You know I want it, I need it
Don’t doubt it, I can’t live without it
This is everything I dreamed of
It’s everything I’ve ever wanted
But is it really truly in my plans
Or did God mix up my blueprints?
Did he have it right there in his hands?
Anybody give me a hint
I can feel it now I know it’s coming
And I don’t give a fuck what anybody say
I’ve fallen, I’ve risen, I chose and selected this mission
Incarceration through these bars created a prison
And I intend to do the time that the sentence is given
25 to life yeah that’s how I’m living
Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever make it
But there’s only way I'ma know
I’m like a seed planted in the dirt
Feels like I’ve been waiting forever to grow
And maybe today is the day
And maybe tonight is the night
But one thing that I know for sure
This time I’ma get it right

Logic, Logic, Logic, Logic
I want what I want how I want when I want it
I’ma keep it a hunnid, I’m blunted
I don’t give a damn, I don’t give a fuck about another man
Fuck a brother man
I’ma make it, make it rain like the weather man
Old girl shoulda, shoulda got a better man
Ass fat, lookin' good in my letterman
In the hood I’m a better man
Wish a mothafucka would, would
Whole life I been up to no good
Change it all if I could
Rearrange my heart, the beat good but I can’t
I’m a sinner, not a saint
Layers to my life, no I can’t
Cover it up with paint
Keep on livin', livin'
Livin' on money and women
As soon as I’m in 'em, I’m out
Now the truth never come out my mouth
Speak life when I come in her mouth, like

I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life, a waste of skin
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me
People try but don’t know 'bout me
But the Devil said that he want my soul
But the Devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now

Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

I’d rather be a different man in another world
Than work for the man in my universe
Wonder what it feel like to take flight
Momma told me everything gon' be alright
I mean my life can’t be off right
But come to think about it
Everybody runnin' the world seem to be all white
Can you mothafuckas see alright?
I mean, I need it, I want it, I gotta have it
Every day tragic
If you’re from where I’m from, everyday ain’t magic
On this I know
I been telling everybody I’ma give it a go, I know
I been there before, feel it in my soul, oh I know!
Love it or hate it, I made it
I did it, I lived it
While the whole world lookin' at the boy like whoa!
Baptized in a ocean of Hennessey
Really wonder what the remedy
Tell me, how the world gon' remember me?
Got me feelin like the enemy
Like I ain’t got no energy
I been lookin' for an entity
Feelin' like I need to chill, like I need a new amenity
Fuck all that

I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life
A waste of skin
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me
People try but don’t know 'bout me
But the Devil said that he want my soul
But the Devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now

Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

I know my life was lived the wrong way
I know I did you wrong in my own way
But it was the flashing lights that mesmerized
That hypnotized the only
Part of me you loved
Part of me that had the strength to rise above
Part of me you know
Part of me you love more than to let it go

Dear God, I just wanna know why
Why do you put us here?
Why do you put us below?
Why do you put us subservient?
Why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers?
And then we crawl and we scratch our way out
We betray each other
We lie, we take from one another
And we told you gon' forgive us at the end
But the state don't forgive us
I'm locked up and half my friends
And then when I get out, or I make it out
I'm expected to somehow give back
To people who never wanted to see me escape
I'm startin' to hate the man in the mirror
And it's gettin' clearer
That society was designed to keep me on the bottom
So, if you real, if you're out there for real
Please explain to me why
Why do we suffer? Why do we die?
And why do the people
Who go against everything you ever said always get ahead?
I've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right
But tonight, I am in this church
Asking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me
Because I'm tired and I don't know what else to do
So black I'm blue, so brown I'm down
I done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up
I am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame
And all I wanna do is believe in you
The darker you are, the closer you are to dirt
And they make sure it hurts
And I am tired of hurtin', man
I'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared
So if you out there, do something about this
'Cause I can't take it no more
Help me
