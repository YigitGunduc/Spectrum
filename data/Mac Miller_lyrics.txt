Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Yo, now

I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets
Roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins
I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems
Fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious
They nothin' to me though I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights
Talk too much, the wrong advice
All the lights and call my life
Doctor, doctor, will you help me?
Get me healthy
Keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now
Fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch you jealous now
Smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now
All the pain that they causin'
Like, fuck it, we ballin'
Now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling
I'm chilling, just living
I'm burning away
Conversations we having
I'm getting too static
Too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break

But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight

I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind
Bitches in the concubine
I call her mine, crazy
She ain't' God as I
I make water wine
Pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line
I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering, well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, God damn
I'm poppin' them downers
And drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter
I'm stuck on the browsers
Like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me
This shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m in, gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I live with you, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
Cause Fridays are always
The start of the time of my life, alright
When I get faded you hate it
But, baby, it’s gon be alright, ha, alright
Some people, oh, whoa, oh-oh...
Yeah, people say, people, oh-oh, say...

People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking 'bout her all the time
I've never seen somebody put together perfectly
What do I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view
You don't have to cry, you don't have to cry

Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shooting stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did, I think I'm still myself

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view
You don't have to cry, you don't have to cry
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Macadelic
Motherfucker, hahahahah

I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sipping
Groupies fall in love, I'm like bitch you must be tripping
I'm just tryna fuck and she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck and nothing 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain
Yeah, you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
But it don't make a difference if you crying in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'mma kill more, I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mil more, play a number one spot on the Billboard

Yeah, people lie, numbers won't
Keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup
Watch the world go up in smoke

I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasing after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

I'mma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine
Hammer team, in that pack with me
Hear that Jerm beat banging, with a glass of lean
When I went to every high school class would be
Tryna fuck the female faculty
I'm a crazy little fucker, think my head done ran away
I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay'
I just made a million dollars, still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way, when you meet me, bitch stand up straight
Pump out raps, yeah I got raps, tryna talk shit what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank rolls, I'mma lay low chill, 'til I let that stack

Yeah, people lie, numbers won't
Keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup
Watch the world go up in smoke

I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know,never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasing after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
Hey! Ayo, Sap! What's good, bruh?
This man is kinda high over here

Ayo, the flyest motherfucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget
When you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public
And you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take them to the pad, it's a wrap

And motherfuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take them to the pad, it's a wrap
Think I can see a fucking halo, about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano, some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches
He got special needs
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping
Al be fucking with the fader, sipping mind eraser
Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it
Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public
We the Republican government, abundance of substance
Having consumption to fuck a bitch
You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick!
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first
After rapping take my people out for octopus
We all deserve it; dedication to the fam
Don't hold your hand out for nothing
If you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
Blow the dice, roll them chips, hit another trip
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the 6 in the summertime
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma
My look is Jay Buhner, dawggy
‘Cause some of us just age sooner
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio, I fixed the game
Between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild


Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor, chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
I came from that basement, now look at this view
Making this money, blowing it all
Fuck what you did, just show me results

Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly mothafucka
Leather to the foot, horses, I lead 'em to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money, but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no mothafuckin' faking that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks
I hold the multi-colored flavored gat – blat!

I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs

You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name says "Crack dealing trap nigga slash cap peeler
Back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor
Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
You who I'm finna murder, this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you, Beastie Boy
You can't match your killer with that wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were strucking blows, bloody nose for your honey rolls
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You're a bully's Best Day Ever with them Nike's on your feet
Coming through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga, give me that shit!
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps – who the fuck is Mac Miller?
It's the, rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
Bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rapping head honcho, rocking shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my g pass, none of your fucking beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish them
Tryna find a balance reaching from my equilibrium
Fools I pity them, I'm not a human I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men
I ain't saving nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'till the angels come and skipping all the famous functions
How do the famous function?
The A list can't be trusted
I strong arm them like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich this is piracy (piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fucking eyes to see
Come and die with me

Cause everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies

Uh, okay
My mind is Yoda I'm on Ayatollah
These other rapper just a diet soda
I find Jehova in the darkest places
Empty as apartment basements
This a marathon gentlemen go ahead and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
Don't come up missing
Tell your bitch that you've been trippin' now you on vacation
Rapping like it's automated
Lights I keep em' on like Vegas
Love I'm making so hot I'm turning hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star I'm way farther with the constelations
Contemplating suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind it's a prison homie leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets
Ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewriting history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Running to the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle I'm a show you the commercial
I've been popping like a kernel
Reading Justin Beiber's journal
Treat you like a urinal
Close your eyes...

So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition about these women
And suspicion got me lookin' at you different
How a man in my position can't start slippin' down these slopes
'Cause it's all just (downhill from there)
As a kid I didn't learn that, but (now I'm aware)
When you a youngin
You just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you about to leave it to these young kids
And we gonna show you what the love is...

Stay high, go for what you know
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
It won't stop!

You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

Uh, and I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie can't you see I'm chillin? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of sastisfaction
Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on an idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, "Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"
Just continue livin' life, cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restart now, cause we comin' for you anyways

Stay high, go for what you know
Yeah, Macadelic...
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
It ain't never gon' stop cause

You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
I told you it won't stop cause
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make up
Wipe the smudge of makeup off my bed
Soon as she’s gone and take up
Hours out my day just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it
Even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre
I mean the sun is slowly falling, we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh you left your phone behind?
Identity crises break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open
Of oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme, choking
Or soaking up game, I'm hoping you picked the second one
Change the emotion of jealousy that you're holding
You're telling me that you're golden but really cubic zirconia
Let me see, I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you Mayweather, you

You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

(women moaning)
Hallelujah, thank God I have a future
Praying I don't waste it getting faded
Cause I'm smoking *censored* 'til I'm coughing up tar
Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Tripping out, looking at a bunch of Google map stars
Shit, they got a app for... that

But me, I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm living paradise, so would I have to worry 'bout?
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure
Find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
The difference between love and war inform me
I'm above the norm
But, give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhyming like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm running from, but I'm running still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you ain't talking 'bout some money I'mma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's letting me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow
That's just me all wilding out and being extra doe

And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly, watching horror movies
With some foreign groupies, thinking this decor suits me
I do drugs to get more loopy, I'm in tune
To ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful
Looking out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet
I think I'm JFK's final speech
They try assassinating all of my beliefs
But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind
And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same
I'm looking my window ashing on the pane
Shit, wonder if I lost my way

Don't you ever wanna hide away
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today
I'll greet the devil with a smiling face
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with Freemasons
My girl's switching the locks, the keys keep changing
Dreaming of places, my own personal creations
If there's a party in heaven I plan to leave wasted
Retracing my steps way back to Biblical times
We-we all gon' end up meeting at the finishing line

And these words that I command you today shall be in your heat
And you shall teach them diligently to your children
And you shall speak of them when you sit at home
And when you walk along the way, and when you lie down
And when you rise up, I am the lord, your god
Uh, $ign
Oh no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no ($ign)
Aye—

I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night

Okay your legs like a store they open up
And you got people in line
Been here every night for weeks at a time
You in my dreams, that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you
Just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
The type of thing I heard it happen all the time
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a rebel, go a second and a third time
Left you up a verse mind
And when you hungry, I can chef you up a stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate  yah third eye
First prize, Nobel, get a piece
Your clothes off, turn around, let me see

I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night

Yeah, okay I came up with a plan, it was take you by the hand
And bring you somewhere where the sand is
Soon as we landed
We went straight into the room
And played the music, started dancing
You was taking off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore
I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we moved it to the floor
You started getting crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't your type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doing everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn it feels so right
Yeah, but I still respect the game
Every time I'm out of line you always set me straight
The sex is great, for Heaven's sake I need it every day
I yell your name, Cinderella
Never gonna find nobody better, all my life...

I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night

Hey now, I'm saying
My only way out is the way in
I won't stop 'til you're mine, no way
Well all my days now, they changin'
I got angels, no more Satan
Looks like God's on my side, this time
Well, I been meanin' to tell you
You lookin' better every day, write you letters
It's only right that right after love, I write my name
If it's forever or never, it's all the same
Under the weather
Feel much better hen that weather isn't rain, yeah
Ooh Cinderella, don't you run out of time
It feels like you've been taking all day
Wherever you came from, wherever you going
I promise I'm not far behind, yeah
So don't you dare throw this away
I been meanin' to tell you
You lookin' better every day, write you letters
It's only right that right after love, I write my name
If it's forever or never it's all the same
Under the weather
Feel much better when that weather isn't rain
Don't know why thinking of him makes me smile...

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart
Why would it even try?
Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever
I know you far too smart
Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober
This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

If you wanna stay, we're taking it slow baby
Cause you and me, and I got enough on my mind
But I can make some time for something so divine

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love
People worship these idols, 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better remember all that you practice
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket, whoa
Think it's time for a revolution, me and my dawgs 'bout to start a riot
Still they sleeping when I'm eating, you and your people are on a diet
Tim Allen off Home Improvement, intelligent but we going stupid

Out in London like Lennox Lewis, bitch looking like Farrah Fawcett
I'm just tryna make better music, get this money, share the profits
Now this class getting led by students
Smoke some weed, get head while I do it
Started out under the ground
They didn't fuck with me, now they all coming around
Money I'm hunting it down
Planting the seeds, working and watching it grow
I got so many ways I can make money
I'll always be straight, I just thought you should know
Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne

Looking at my life is like you watching movies
Y'all are looking at my life is like you watching movies

People worship these idols, 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better remember all that you practice
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket, whoa
Fuck a day job, fuck a day job, got ya bitch here in just a tank top

In the face looking at you like ("Wait!")

But my heart like gold, but it break like glass

Yeah it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
You way too drunk, you don't know what I'm saying
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night, I keep you waiting
You say you don't care, is what you saying
We both know that's some bullshit
Okay, we be fighting, we be reuniting
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited

Well, you can't go away girl, I'mma need you
Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy league school
Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude
I just eat pussy, other people need food
Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguing about who ain't giving who attention
Starting up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
And I use every bone in my body
To keep on holding on to your trust
I know you don't want nothin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much
Fuck 'em all, let's be us, summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none
It's complicated, keeping me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it's seems inviting, trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'

Uh uh
Close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep
Watching Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm under water in my dreams
I'm in awe, this jigsaw, puzzles not complete
I'm just an idea, nothing concrete
Came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hating on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
I'm no God, I don't think that I'm a human, though cause I'm so odd
People selling drugs cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, (Dylan)

Somebody do something (Somebody do something)
Somebody do something (Somebody do something)

Sipping Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavouring
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off and leave it dangling
FlyLo's still tryna put me on to Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I ain't nobody, and neither are you
Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth
I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
All your songs are sixteen's and a hook
We're here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm dying for the movement, trying not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consuming the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
I hear the fish biting nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown, poo

Somebody do something (Somebody do something)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Somebody do something (Somebody do something)
Somebody do something (Somebody do something)

Trippy, some high ass music man
This shit got me fucked up right now
This music has got me in a trance
I'm stoned like a motherfucker, nigga
2050 trippy shit
Yes I am high, for the rest of my life
Was that good for you?
(coughs)
I think I'm getting sick
Been in this room
Like I was high

Look, I'm posing a question
How many been empty and holding aggression?
Close to depression
Open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother
My mind is my weapon, I'm letting it go
Loading and pointing at negative energy
Telling me stop, they're telling me, "No, don't"
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock
Praise me I'd rather you not
Cause it's driving me crazy
The fact that you pay to make me into something I love
You come to the club searching for drugs
Drunk, fucking these sluts
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?
You're wasting away doing nothing, you're fronting
Why ain't you chasing your dreams?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn is something to burn
Why won't they give me a turn out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You're mistaken the world is cold and it's lonely ain't it
When 'em high roller homes in Vegas
Raid 'em with some home invasions
Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spitting these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like he work in the morgue, absorbing the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today
Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death, 'til there's nobody left
You're holding your breath because you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinking I'm getting ballistic
Be specific, to those who in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers
Except I'm cool with Vader
And blowing up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor, the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you're a hater, I'll deal with you later, no thank you
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on homie, we major
I waste away in this room spitting out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive


It's just a different time, man, it's just a different time. There was a time, when we showed love. You know like how we, approach a young lady, you see a beautiful young lady you like, you say "Damn, man." You're gorgeous, I'll take off my coat right now and, lay it down on the puddle and, make sure you don't miss a step. You know what I'm talking bout, young man? See all these bitches, hoes, thots? I just don't understand it. I don't know what's to come of you, young man
Yeah you know I'm smokin' at the beginnin'
Of the song like a damn, rapper
Aww man, man, it's crazy bein' so rich, damn

In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When it still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we were on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd's brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
And thick lens coverin' my eyes now
They ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if this a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doing fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
And posted up drowsy
In the cut so much that it's pus 'round me
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (nah)
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin
Between you and all these fuck niggas
Is about as large as it gets
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' cause he ain't workin'
Like a long distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlison win, nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds branch out
And I'm out with my face in the shallow, drownin' again

I've been drownin' with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian
Just look at the state he's in... yo, yo
The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost
Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman while that cape was off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a mothafucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane
It was like Cobain hit his last number, mothafucka

I've been drownin' with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

Well, isn't he dizzy off the up's and down's
Got a little Whitney, put it in a blunt for now
She was supposed to get me high
Why the fuck I wanna die now?
And I'm strung out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house, I told the bitch slow down
Stop runnin' your mouth
You holdin' my money, just shut up and count
My right nostril hasn't worked in a week
Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheep
Me, I'm swervin' in the Jeep
Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street
Yellin' "play my shit and wake the baby up!”
I get her faded, put her back in the labia
All my life I've been afraid of powder
All my life I've been afraid of power, where did all that go?
The wrong decision always called my phone
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones
I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone
That can save me from the war unknown
Shoutout to Soulo (SOUL!) and rest in peace Alori Joh
The devil on the other side of the glory hole
Any time, any place, you could bet I'ma eat
Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road
Look at all these new faces
I see, I see, I see
They're comin' on the plane but they're leavin' in suitcases
Been a criminal before scales were digital
Used the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics
Hate myself up to strangers
But the raps are just way too flagrant, so
Here I go, here I go
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary
I've never been religious
But I feel like the scripture's got it all there
It's not just gypsies and fairies
This could be my last breath, I'ma take my time
Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind

You are standing in the shallow soul
You are speaking with the shallow soul
Shallow soul
I've been drowning with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinking from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
(fades)
Uhh, let me get a turkey sandwich, uh lettuce tomato (bitch)

My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you
Well my crew too live but I ain’t Uncle Luke
And I ain’t no hipster, but girl I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Looking out my monocle
I’m dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I’m heroin cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fucking shiny word to Mop & Glo
Tryin’ to get a mansion ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day these losers always goin’ with whats trendy
My pen game is something these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion everybody is second string
No need to testify (testify) for the best is I (best is I)
And anybody in my way goin’ to be left to die

I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch
I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
Anything you need you can find it at the market

I got my own stickers now so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool you better get prepared
Don’t know ‘bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage
Sick bars I’ve been a boss so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chilling writing on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just bout who the hardest
On my own two, fuck who's saying different
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling
I’m the starter you the fill in
You a martyr I’m just killing
Getting harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin’ it and goin’ in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn’t fuckin’ know me then
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in

I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch
I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
Anything you need you can find it at the market
I hope you're proud of me, dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories
Like they were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people full of me
Are you made of
I admit I guess I'm full of myself too
There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you
This life move's fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now, I need to run to to any
Place the train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me
About some business shit
Never really listening
Couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate, sound the same
When my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)

I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia, lost somewhere out in
West Virginia

It's a dark science, when your friends start dying
Like how could he go? He was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dryed in
Couple years are gone by by then
Can you please help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need
Multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place
Where the time don't end
You don't need money
All you got is time to spend
Life is short, don't ever question the lengths
It's cool to cry
Don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate
Thought, go 'head just give it a shot
You'll remember shit you've forgot

Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
And when the whole world is looking hopeless
I'mma still hold shit down

I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia, lost somewhere out in
West Virginia
Uh, ignorant-ass white kid
But I'm still bicycling and recycling
And I'm still eating Gummy Bear vitamins
All my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen
Hyper than Williams, middle son, since I was
A little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Coming up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed
Contagious, speaking while sedated
God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothing left in my will
'Cept throw it all in the casket, it's mine still
I need some backpack cast raps
Took a break just to kill the game half-ass
Set some rat traps, went to take a cat nap
Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic
Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke
Slap her but she like it, tell me, "Master, feed me pipe"
I'm the Scotch on the Rocks, you the Appletini type

Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it (Gees)
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it (Gees)

I still fucking with these hoes, though
Bozo on these doppelgänger Jojos
Take a bitch to Soho for some Froyo
Tell her she gon' blow it, Romo
And now I'm out in Cali like Tone-Lōc
Young boy, but I'm chilling with some grown folk
No joke, most dope, you just bowl smoke
How much coke you got to sell to make a boat float?
Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me "No more"
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say "What's up?" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche
Who you kidding? Your flow's warshed
I ain't from the street but I'll grill you from the porch
I been had hoes, I play sports
Her ass out the bottom of her shorts

Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it (Gees)
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it (Gees)

(Black James Bond and a white Shaft)
Turned my daughter to a queen, turned a dollar to a dream
Flashy as high beams, smoking on good weed
Something from kush seeds, the only strand to smoke for us OG's
I'm rich - car service, no car keys
First class flight, 'bout to land to a new bitch
She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came with
MCM bag and nigga, bet some weed in it
200 dollars worth of Backwoods, we all living
Brought the gangsters back to bucket hat, how real is that?
I'm getting money, rub my tummy, that's my baller sack
Quarter million in a safe in case I get a case
Faggot-ass judge hating on me cause my money straight
Dropped 10 racks in all 50 states
Gon' name my next tour Million-Man March
Make a nun throw it back while I pull her scarf
She gave me head, my nuts touched her cross, boss, Figg Side

Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Let me get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packing no bags, nothing but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryna to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't staying long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me
Well, I made it big and, everybody phony
Ha, so could you pour me, I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mixing purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much
Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free

They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the street, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
I don't know, what the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?

What do you do when you think you could be an icon?
Cause all these people get to screaming with the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racing to the gate but my flight gone
And now these writers taking shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my sprite, then my night slows... down, down
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was "Donald Trump," a fucking hit but I just call it luck
They throw it on when I'm walking in the club
Hey, this the Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you looking far beyond the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill your cup up, and I'mma sip mine

They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the street, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
I don't know, what the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like
Someone like you, someone like you
Someone like, someone like

Yeah, light up 'til the pain gone, all I hear is the same song
When the radio came on, fuck around and get based on
Do this shit 'til the day I die, are you ready, are you ready?
Terrified but my hand is steady, verified, get the camera ready
Carry my own weight, all these earthquakes don't wake
Me up from this deep sleep, diving into this cold lake
Fuck a bitch til her toes shake, telling me I'm her soul-mate
Disguised emotion, no face, bullshit with that, no thanks
Dealing with it since '08, fucked around, now I'm done
And I heard you're supposed to race
When you hear the sound of that gun
Now it's losing all of its fun, spending days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews, put me in this awful mood
Not thinking logical, getting high, jump off the moon
Looked into his soul, when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible, when the mind is so closed
Came in for your money, then left with all of your hoes

Life move fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind start forgetting what you know
Shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone
You hurt so good, girl your loving hurt so good

Love me, love me, that fentanyl it numb me
Beautiful it get ugly, turn you into a junkie
Still searching for something, but I don't know what
Dreaming about nothing, wake you up and then fuck
I love it when you get a little nasty
Hit it from the back, if you like that, wiggle them ass cheeks
Isn't that sweet, same shit we did last week
'fore all the cash, you might stood up and would've walked passed me
Wake me up from this bad dream, put a match to this gasoline
Every night you somebody different, got me thinking it's Halloween
Fucked up, I can't feel myself, work hard might kill myself
Exist through audio, but all my problems that's real as hell
Trapped in this wishing well, death creeping like Splinter Cell
Getting high, blew my mind away
Find the words to what I'm tryna say
...I'mma think of that later
When the world goes against you, better get that paper

Life move fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind start forgetting what you know
Shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone
You hurt so good, girl your loving hurt so good
You hurt so good
You hurt so good
Good evening everybody
How's everybody doing?
Just wanna ask a question, um, have you,  have you
Have you been in love, before?
You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should probably take your heels off
Cause you've been running through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain these days of rain
You're playing games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still trying to find you, I'm looking for you babe
And I'm still trying to find you, through sunshine or rain
I love you

Yeah, you got your stained glass iris
Diamond behind your eyelids, autopilot fly
My heart skipped a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date, let's take it easy
Love is power
Swear there's something about her that make me nervous
Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl you know I'm loving you just like you deserve it
So baby make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug and love to death
Feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream
So fuck the world, it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah

Your love is not too kind, to me, yeah
You know my love is sugar sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind, is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

Yeah, and she is cool, calm and collected
I knew that you was the one
When I seen you leave me breathless
Say okay I need a second day today, give me attention
I want to take care of you
Marry you, something I'm prepared to do, there can't be two
You was here, I ran from you, scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you're not, you up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession
I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong, everything you do is right
Let's start a family, hold on to forever baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy (moan)
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen
Look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love that love was record breaking
I'm sick of waiting, yeah

Your love is not too kind, to me, yeah
You know my love is sugar sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind, is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

So gimme all of your love
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine
Gimme all of your love
You will be mine through rain and through shine
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah yeah, yeah

(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah yeah, yeah
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say "ow", make 'em say "oh"
The hoes that tell me "yes", the same ones that tell you "no"
Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever

If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone, move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie I'll be sure

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy,only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever
Open your legs
Say yeah, share, say yeah, share, say yeah

Hearts on my timeline, bullet to your rose
Then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty, have no guideline
One day, four times
You don't mind that I don't care (pleasure, pleasure...)
Your divinity has turned me into a sinner
God is fair (pleasure, pleasure...)
And your beauty can even make hell have a winter

Yeah and a freak mind is divine so we fuck from behind
On these sides, between thighs, I eat up
Why do, why do anything but trust myself?
Tried to give her up but she fuck so well
Man that bitch so cold, man that bitch so cold
I'ma take my time, I'ma hit that slow
'Cause I ain't in a rush young girl
You're the only thing for me in this fucked up world
And do you believe in love?
Hold on tight when demons come
It'll be alright, no need to run
Stay with me tonight, we'll see the sun
And when we wake up early we'll still be young
Never felt this free before
I need you more than keys and doors
I need you sleepin' next to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take them all and keep you warm
Yeah and I teach her that we were the creatures of love
You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar
When I'm pullin' up in the Beamer
The beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna fuck

Hearts on my timeline, bullet to your rose
Then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (have no guideline)
One day, four times
You don't mind that I don't care (pleasure, pleasure...)
God is fair (pleasure, pleasure...)

I need to feel your touch
You shy, you don't reveal too much
No lies, don't hide yourself at all
With you, I just can't help but fall
It's true, and I'll try everything
Girl you're, my sexy nasty, thing
She been getting faded all the time, flap your wings
I been getting stoned all week
It make me go too deep
Girl you so lonely, will you come home with me?
Just take your clothes off babe
Know that we been talkin' on the phone all day
I love it when you tell me that you don't behave
Tell me when and where, I bet I won't be late
All I really wanna do is procreate
I'm a Superman, you'll be my Lois Lane
Know you late for work, you stayin' home today
We gon' keep on goin' 'til our bones both break
It's the grown folk way, yeah

Hearts on my timeline, bullet to your rose
Then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (have no guideline)
One day, four times
You don't mind that I don't care
God is fair


Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building and he would help me with things and I would see him and think "what a cute guy" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little we got to know, just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being...finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...
So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.
Yo, yo, yo

Look, concoction of hamentashens, launching a bottle rocket (ok)
Done being nice, I'm here for your life and all the profits (woah)
I'm not your conscience, you nuts? Almonds and Häagen-Dazs
Auction off your grandfather's watch from the Holocaust
I'm iconic, naked walking in the garden and bird watching
Alarming all of these cardinals like I need a pope (pope)
Puffing that white smoke (smoke), get faded and play the maestro
I'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe (probably velvet)
Sneaky bitch stole my Rollie last night, yo
I might know some dyke hoes who can fight though (yeah)
Walking on a tight rope, underneath a microscope
But close up, we all just molecules and isotopes (that's very deep)
What psychic don't know the future?
To live life, you kids might just close your computer (go get some excercise)
The street lights might blind you though (blind you though)
Make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope

There's a bird, in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Let the money pile, I'll be running wild
Life's a mothafuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep
Literally, I do this in my sleep


It's an impression of Bueller
Yeah, yeah,a little TV money (okay), dollars for sense of humor(yeah)
Scholar but my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor
Some cold brews in the cooler (have one)
Coming through in the wood grain PT Cruiser, stunting
I'm pissed off like a blind person looking for a restroom (restroom)
Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes (coughs)
Sorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude (yeah)
And I was raised better, say God bless you (God bless you)
I'm Kenny Powers, you're more of a Debbie Downer
My bitch taking off her trousers every time I get around her
I'm nasty, I never shower, go sleep on a bed of flowers
Not into this conversation, I've been in my head for hours
I'm out

There's a bird, in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Let the money pile, I'll be running wild
Life's a mothafuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep
Literally, I do this in my sleep
Uhh, passport, filling it up with stamps
Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan
She keep on asking for a rack so I ran
Looking back like you can't see who I am
Think my bitch don't know me no more
Cause everytime she's sad, I can't console her no more
If money buy you love, then love's not enough
So tell my why you on your knees crying to the floor
If you had the chance
Would you take the time you need to make it right?
The clouds are gray
But would you pay the price to paint 'em white?
Might have a baby on the way
Cause I been going in raw, it feel better, that real pleasure
I'm not real, I think I never was
I get a rush every time she let me get a touch
I need to feel that (love) I need to feel that (pain)
My garden hasn't been growing so can you bring that (rain)
I keep my head up (high) a little fed up (lies)
They always tell me where my mind is on this LP
I don't exist, hieroglyphics
Pyrotechnics, metaphysics
Telekinetics put 50K on my credit card
Look for the answers, I'm searching but I ain't getting far
Let's get it on, I'm royal like Tenenbaums in Lebanon
Decepticons, hit it 'til my head is gone

Point me to the road, and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes (never that) getting duckets
'Til I die, while my foes busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toasted in public
Head in the clouds and my toes in the struggle
Like who didn't test yet? Test this
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch
Listen up, go

See this a rather spooky action movie, roll it up and pass it to me
Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting bourgie
See a creature, ass beauty, need a feature, rather shoot me
Truly bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you in fact assuming
Back to doing cash pursuing, posted up like Patrick Ewing
Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it
Don't forget you infested in nasty crevices
Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly
He and I are not the same
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me something for the pain
Money in machines, those will make you change
If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain, but I can't complain

Point me to the road, and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes (never that) getting duckets
'Til I die, while my foes busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toasted in public
Head in the clouds and my toes in the struggle
Like who didn't test yet? Test this
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch
Listen up, go

Revis take me shoppin' when I'm up in New York
Hit the shoe store go and cop a few more
You at the mall getting dinner at the food court
I'm at LA eatin' 22 course
Young boss bitch, paper in my pockets
I got a closet filled with shoe boxes
Mom says my spending habit a little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes wear-em-out
Hit the club bitches pull they cameras out
Livin' in a dream they beginnin' to believe
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed
Shit, with what I'm spittin' they should give me a degree
Good liquor what I'm sippin' isn't cheap
Uh, finna blow, don't snooze, don't sleep
All I really need is some shoes on my feet

So they stay attached to my gonads
Wakin' up to a few L's
Open up my closet to that new shoe smell
I guess I'm goin' well
Smoking all the weed that I used to sell
But once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now we sellin' tapes out my shoe box
Any spot just set up my shop
Ya mad that ya girl always says that I'm hot
Shes buyin' my t-shirt but shes spendin' your guap
Say wuddup if you see me around
Nike Airs separate my feet from the ground

Better act right cause I smack dykes, give 'em blow and a bit of that bagpipe
Bitch wanna live that rap life, but I already hit that last night
Think you're fucking with me, huh? Must be hitting that crack-pipe
I be making my money, thank God I learned how to add right
My cash like that cocaine, give me more, say give me more
Don't worry 'bout it, ain't no thing, big titty hoes in my videos
Classy bitch, don't kiss and tell, smack her ass and then wish her well
Life sucks, better give 'em hell, get money, fuck girls, free Biggavel
A million in my briefcase, 'bout to shop for some real estate
'bout to party with drugs though, turn it up, bitch feel the bass
Throwing money, in your face, feeling good, living great
Bad bitches in different states, it's like I think I'm Vincent Chase
With pornstars, sports cars, and my crib got a courtyard?
How we get all this money though? You know how big his tours are?
Greedy bitch, you a needy bitch, want some money, but need some dick

And my belt monogram, when I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram
When I die bet she fuck my hologram
My hologram

We in my black Benz, windows up, getting head, smoking blunts
Everybody know what's up and I turn them girls to sluts
Crib's like a mob boss, my bitch get my car washed
We non-stop, my dick out, her jaw drop
Cause all we do is fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck
All she, all she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck

Don't I look like a drug dealer? Don't I look like I'm somebody
Killing beats with that Murder Inc, don't I look like I'm Irv Gotti
Riding through with my hippy van, you broke bitches don't give a damn
You softer than the Michelin man, your bitch put her pussy on Instagram
Better go hard when my flow start, they brand new with they old cars
Your pockets is on low carbs, she do a show, she a pollstar
In the penthouse, with the pants down with the camera out, no hands now
Them hard drugs, we don't ran out
Can't believe that's someone's grand child
She's so bad but I like it, wanna hear your pussy I'll mic it
My credit card bill is righteous but girl that ass is so priceless
Spend the night with the right bitch, my dick ill, my pipe sick
Small pussy, tight fit, she loves to sniff that white shit
Fuck free, no charge, I play with that pussy like Mozart
Eat that pussy, I won't starve, love the pussy with my whole heart
Bitch named Layla my Clapton ho
Give me head put the Benz in captain mode

And my belt monogram, when I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

I don't know why I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say
It's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'
Why you got me stressin'?
I could have a whole collection
Just be faded in my own dimension
You so complicated, I swear that pussy Grammy nominated
Let's make some music, fuck all of the bullshit

So just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

Okay now, baby, don't you leave my side, don't even try
I'mma go crazy, girl, you saved me
Meditate me, get me piece of mind
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between her lines
Binge watched "Sopranos", made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I
She had to come, see her freaky side, leavin' me behind

Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
So just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body

Whoa, what do we have here?
People want to know how we could be that weird
How many hoes want to clean Mac's beard?
I kill flows, think I need that tear on a tattoo
My bitch suck, she a vacuum
Fuck her in the ass everytime I'm in a bad mood
Ain't got a choice, know she do it cause she have to
I hit it raw while I'm listening to Papoose
No respect, cause you wear a V-neck
I mean stress, pressure that could even make Keith sweat
I wish Narnia was on a GPS
I wish Rihanna was DTF
I got rich with these rap songs
Bought a drug problem, now the cash gone
Album filled with all sad songs
But this the one that I can laugh on

Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body

Girl, shake that body, them ass and totties
I want to see them cankles at my hotel lobby
Bitch, why you so damn snobby?
Your ass flatter than the back of my head
I bought you dinner now it's time to pay me back with some head
Or I'ma have my little sister beat the back of your head
I'm a grade-A douchebag, I'm a dickhead
Asshole area where my gooch sag
Little momma got salty at me, she started talking tough
So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up
Popped a hundred mollies, fifth of sherm, think I was sparking up
A bottle of Zima, the Beamer, I started parking up
Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back
And then we jet to Fatburger, ordered some Big Macs
And bitch came with a gauge, and she wanted my fade
But I'm a bitch-ass nigga so I say

Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body

T-Dollaz and Mac Meezy
Making sure you niggas don't win like referees
Looking for the bitches that love to suck peewee, Herman, I'm a vermin
And you could tell I golf with my hat, man, fuck Thurnis

I'm at IHOP's and eating with Tyler
Drink cocoa then double-team Mariah
But please, don't tell Nick
We were all watching movies at a Motel 6
Like ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
I hope Kendrick fuck Gaga
If Madonna on the Kabbalah
Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas
I don't need Prada to show you I'm rich
Pulling out the llama like "Show me your tits"
Keep crying cause I still ain't over my bitch

Oh well, it'll be OK...
(Yeah)
Can you feel it?
Don't answer that, that was a rhetorical question
(Ahem) rhetorical (rhetorical)
(unhhh)

Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process
And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's saying the place is safe for me
I told "wait for me," the make believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walking I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these primadonnas
I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings

I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Take me away girl, somewhere they won’t be
Hold you closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

I'm just trying to make it all make sense
As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time “we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes
We all in search for substance, that drugs you pain and numbness
Circumstances advance the second chances for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrows trend
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days
Life, it works in such mysterious ways
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say

I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Take me away girl, somewhere they won’t be
Hold you closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

Wherever my mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well that's ridiculous
I'm a live forever, cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me? High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal is a loaded gun
And I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one
But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America

Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options
American born, impeccable form above and beyond, never the norm

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America

Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? Bet I steal her
Shout out my wigga Mac Miller, comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
They don't know I come from the illest
City on the map, we don't know how to act, ahh!
Realest young rappin go getters in America
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go
CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal
Veggies

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America

Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach 6
Rise to the top, the topics change
The Glocks in the Stock Exchange
Now watch the price of life on the block drop, insane
You can't stop this reign, don't name drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters so I've been afloat
No deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes
Sun got shine, now they say he shady but he never dippin' though
Still facing L's, you would think a nigga's wins was low
What you think I'm in this for?
Won't stop 'til the nigga who invented dope
End the flow or behind bars droppin' prison soap
Begging for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources now he in the store
This is madness (madness)
This is an outrage! (an outrage)
As a matter of fact, this is outrageous! (outrageous)
Hahahah, yeah

Young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer
Rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina
Like I want kids, my head continues to be haunted
I burn a city down while I'm unconscious
Maybe gon' and take some quaaludes, conversate with Jesús
Batting practice with the mothafuckin' ghost of Babe Ruth
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful
Devil on my trails, I'm trying to find the Holy Grail
(Coughs repeatedly) Right there
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target
Then I don't know why I even started
I'm sick of being too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light
Told myself, "Fuck the world kid, just do what you like
Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life
You're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity
But all those big words ain't gon' get you paid
And those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid
You got it made in that mad house
What the fuck you got to be sad 'bout? Go 'head and rap now
Do what you do best
I mean, that's what you do best
Matter fact mothafucka, you suit vest, you need to buy a new dress
I heard you and your girl live in a duplex
I'ma put her ass in a suplex, the sun east, the moon west
You got a clue, what does a clue get? Nothing"

My milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the Wicked Witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard
Now the whole world's in color, still
How Auntie Em was next of kin but not her mother, real
Her face was careworn, I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch from the very beginning of year one
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the poems and psalms of Ecclesiastes
Lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell "Hear hear", finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant
So miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent
The hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford
Brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal
Every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca
Shout out to Tony Toca, we ballin' like we suppose to...
Think for yourself and you'll find out
That a lot of those so-called authorities are bullshit
Yeah, aye, Jerm, Jerm
Ahh! Ahh!

I'm the mothafuckin' greatest, y'all don't know that yet
I don't need your money, you can hold that check
At the crib in some Polo sweats
I don't need a hoe, that's what the hoes don't get
I'm on my worst behavior
Bad side piece with the perfect flavor
Mothafuckas never loved us
Comin' for your money, mothafucka don't trust us
Huh, you ain't shit
Bought a brand new crib, yeah, I move that brick
I don't want nothin' with your doo-doo clique
Treat her like a dog, how I do that bitch
Done doin' promo
And it's still mothafuckin' Most Dope
Made a couple million off a brand
Mothafucka, we ain't even got a logo
Bitch, you better have my money (I stay feelin' myself)
I don't see anybody but me (man I'm killin' myself)
And this shit too real
See a mothafucka like me gettin' money
(How does it feel?)
Already been, but I'm back for more
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Don't sleep!

I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
(Don't try to sneak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
(So don't try, don't try to sneak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
(Oh, hello Q)

Yeah, yeah, said, said I'm a maniac, crazy, act insane
Think I might need a cage in fact
Chain reactions happen when I make a pact
A psycho, God made me that
Cause I fade to black and get down like a plane attack
You mothafuckas just made me laugh
Ha ha, God damnit, safety drill, do not panic
Let me see how loud you scream (AHHH!)
I'm off the map, mothafuckas start lookin'
But they're never gonna see where I be
She only speak French
Said "Bitch look, don't try and speak around me"
I don't sleep at all
If you on that bullshit, I don't wanna be involved, shit
I could make a million puttin' my lyrics on a tee
Fearless, Jet Li, fourth quarter, Gretzky
Take your bitch, Joe Pesci, don't test me
Don't flex if you don't got shit on me
And you ain't got shit on me, come get it
(Come get it, come, come get it, come, come)
Drawer full of fresh whites, snow bag full of unleaded
I don't get enough credit
Don't sleep!

(M-M-M-M-M-M)
They done fucked up, han?
The biggest bezzle, han?
The don, Ricky Farrakhan
(M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music)

My weed burnin', my chain glitter
He's self made, Mac Miller my real nigga
Fuck who don't like, bitch come see me
Fuck who don't like, hitta, hitta, hitta
Gettin' money so complicated
I'm the shit, I'm constipated
Yo baby momma, straight G
Let me use the crib to mail all the weed
California, Atlanta
White girl in the black Phantom
My top down, mid-December
Ride with a big black fat nigga
Krispy Kreme, then it's chicken wings
Introduce you, different things
Jet skis and the best weed
Think it's fake? Bitch test me
I'm jetlagged, don't need a stylist
Pants sag, Jimmy Fallon
Blowin' green in the green room
Def Jam like Boss really wildin'
Yeah they hate but won't box a nigga
Bought the estate from a boxer nigga
Paranoid, I'm walkin' 'round
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga
Hahahahaha
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga

I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
(Don't try to sneak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
(So don't try, don't try to sneak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
Damn you rabbit, you smell like fucking piss!
Yeah, no fucks when I go nuts
You can kiss my ass
Give no fucks when I go nuts
Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, yeah
Fucking rabbit!

I give no fucks when I go nuts
Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead
Woke up from a coma
Poured up with a soda, smoked, went back to bed
Never thought I'd be such a loner
I tell my bitch that I fucking own her
My neighbor's daughter just got a dog
I'mma run it over, I'm a fucking soldier
So cold bro, fuck pneumonia
All my bitches got love for Sosa
I just wanna fuck Rosa Acosta
Then disappear in Southern California
Strung out to the night, I'm chilling
Everybody worried that the lights might kill them
Uh, via sight slipping
Long lines of those white women
I'm with the homies, bump Counting Crows
Just went through a half ounce of coke
Blood pouring all out my nose
Don't tell my mom I got a drug problem
I'm fucking high-ly publicized
When the sun go down, I come alive
Cause the guns go off in the summer time
The guns go off in the summer time, blaow

This another motherfucking rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Whoa

The rabbit can kiss my ass
Come on, let's go man
I hate you
Fucking rabbit! Kill his ass!
I don't like rabbits coming to my fucking house, I kill 'em

I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper
And lately, I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily
Getting wasted as the time that I'm spending high and sedated
I'm putting five in his face, because we don't buy into bullshit
As soon as it's flashing lights then it's kush to hide in the bushes
I do this shit out of spite cause there's niggas that overlooked me
Forever, I'm more content with dark and stormier weather
Flip the fucking cross on your rosary, we supposed to be better
But here's a toast to your efforts
And don't approach me with nothing that isn't money or breakfast
I'm close to choking a pussy, pussy
Sweaty Man, you best had bet your bottom dollar on him
With a couple niggas, weighing sess like it's a lot of options
15 on me for soda and swishers
And who's the shit, a bag of chips and a colon decleanser?
I'm over bitches trying to act like I owe 'em a picture
Rather introduce these hoes to Vince who could show you a pistol
Listen, ST was the older initials
Been rap game tighter than boa constrictors
Rolling stone like a boulder raving
I'm so impatient and going dumb as
Disclosing my fucking home location to total strangers
No love in my heart for coppers, blood from my lungs on the sink
Cashing out off the garments, the artist, fuck what you think
The sky'll turn black and the carrions could pick
At my flesh when I rest, tell 'em bury me a-drift

This another motherfucking rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Whoa

It's the official drug user, Soulo
It's Ab-Soul, jack... listen, yo!
Looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like 3 years..
My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this

Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore tho
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna to figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops suck dog nuts
Arrivin' to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes, very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carey feel
At the amusement park scared of heights, ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
It's deja-vu, deja-vu
One time for the grind
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu

Wind chimes, sick rhymes
Been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9"
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrificin' sanity, sacrificin' normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work 4 bars that are tighter than your corn rows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the 4th row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-
Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put em into sonnets
Let me put you on this nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna to find a way
Spread, Like yolk from a broken egg
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave

Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
It's deja-vu, deja-vu
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu

Hypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, 110 degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was 17 I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, 3 new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yea I need my medicine
Fuckin Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'mma be the best, have some patience
Thought that it was great, then poof!
It was nothing but some deja vu, yeah
Clarity...
Clarity...

Clarity—figure all this out, I ain't gona take a charity
Marry me, wish everyone could shake
And play the tambourine perfect
I know I love you I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss, I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive
Infatuation, when every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin' towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, love activeless
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for
I hope you found what you lookin' for

You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
I'mma be waiting for that, I'mma be waiting for that

Misery—you represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me, I'll come out of nowhere—your epiphany
Disconnect from everybody
Who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet is where my mind is so I light another cigarette
To calm me down
So calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around, chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between, purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream, that's so cliché
But I can't tell you what it means to me

You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
I'mma be waiting for that, I'mma be waiting for that

And so it is to the printing press...
To the recorder of man's deeds—the keeper of his conscience
—the courier of his news—that we look for strength and assistance—confident that with your help, man will be what he was born to be—free and independent...
1, 2, 3, pop, pop

I'm always faded, getting shaded in the basement
I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it (play it)
Thank God that I made it (made it), ask Q where Dave is (where is he)

I'm half man-half amazing

Soul!
Ever since a nigga had recess
Mothafucka felt like a grownup (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playing 'round the corner
7 years old saw my first porno, damn, that fucked me up
At 10 I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what
Let's recap, the earth spinning too rapid
I'm living too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
Security guards spark my cigarettes
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look 22
They say you learn when you get older
I just say that that ain't true
That just means when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got L's so I'm riding high, still in high school but I do
Everything I will do, when I'm 25, no lie

I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes
Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes
Tell 'em all what they missing, while I watch it as it unfolds
I'm dodging my death, confident kid
I was tryna grow up with the best
Watching my step, never no college plan
Found myself nodding off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from "The Bachelor"
Could've been smart, could've been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Falling in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama
Only 18 but I had my own business
Then I got fame like "what the fuck is this?"
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches
Everyone around wanna treat me all different
Oh I'm cool, cause I got money
Back in high school none of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts start scaring me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets

They, they, they been looking for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea
Something brand new, wonder what it might be
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed
If you're 18 years and older, 18 years and older
If you're 18 years and older, 18 years and older

I wanna rule the world, take care of my family
And take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds
Blaze a gang of trees
Went to see a rated R movie about me
They said you must be
18 years and older, 18 years and older
18 years and older, 18 years and older
18 years and older
Long days, longer nights
You keep startin' fights think you always right
Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin' but I know you might
Now get along, I get along, I go
You sing along, to every song that you know
You play your part, I'm playin' mine
You breakin hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growing old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm 8 or 9
Trying to move on, talking to my old friends
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causing so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that
Ripping people's hearts out, are you too cute for that, cute for that
I been on the same shit
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language
I guess people always going through changes
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous

Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into detail
About how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave so
Go, go, I'll be fine on my own, own
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into details 'bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go, you'll be fine on your own, own

She tell me, "You an asshole, superficial douche bag
Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me she said, "I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and all of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one, I guess you don't have time
Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm bout to lose you"
I'mma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep
So you can leave a message at the beep

Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into detail
About how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave so
Go, go, I'll be fine on my own, own
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into details 'bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go, you'll be fine on your own, own
Where are you?
Ohhhhh-ohhh (hehehe)
Ohhhhh
The Divine Feminine, an album by Mac Miller
Ohhhhh-ohhh
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
Ohhhhh

Am I supposed to? Okay... love
Love, love, love, love, love (sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (sex)

This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they felt like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl I'm so in love with you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Um, well, baby
You were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said "All you ever think about is sex"
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well
And if this will make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail"
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass what Heaven's like
When I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
That's my only chance, I better get it right

Take your time, my baby
Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
Cause I'm waitin' right here for you, for you

You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your loveliness bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh
"Okay, you work a God damn lousy job, you know
You come home at night, you're tired
What are you going to do? Go to a movie? Turn on your radio?
Hell no you're going to get a bottle of whiskey and drink it
And go down to a bar and maybe get in a fist fight
And meet some bitch, something's going on
Then you'll go to work the next day, and do your simple little things, right?"

Yeah, Yeah, yeah
My bitch can tell that I'm addicted to pussy, she looking past it
The smile that she faking is tragic, hate looking at it
That magic I tried to grasp it, she's had it with the dramatics
Fantasizing love so classic, attracted to what she got up in her attic
Can we mind fuck?
Do I lie when I look inside her eyes? Hush don't say a word
I know I make you hurt, sorry is my favorite word
I don't deserve your trust, but can we make it work?
I hate to end the story, can we wait until the morning to decide on it?
Spend this time pretending it was that first summer
We was pure lovers
She was used to being hurt, I took that curse from her
Sometimes I wonder what it's all for
You wish that I would call more
You're sick of seeing condoms in my sock drawer
Loves turns to war so quickly
I envisioned us - married and 50
Couple of kids that we drop off at little league
I'm addicted to you
You only want the best, I need to listen to you
I'm fucking other girls wishing it's you
Fuck the bullshit, we in love
I'm a mess, but can you clean me up?

Girl I'm the worst
Yea, I know that I'm the worst
Yea, but you're something I can't lose
Let me just tell you the truth, that'd be a first
Girl I'm the worst
Yea, I know that I'm the worst
Don't know what I gotta do, just love you so much that it hurts

And I see you falling victim to the thirst
All the sins you committed you could probably use a couple minutes in church
But, for what it's worth, I think you're perfect
There's an angel hiding underneath your surface
Yeah, the woman of my dreams, I'm looking at her sleep
The pussy right in-front of me, I shouldn't be so weak
What did I do to deserve a love like this?
You see her shining? That's my sunlight bitch
I'm sick of fighting, that smile is so inviting
I see you every time I'm writing
I'm losing to all my vices, they kicking my ass
I hold on to this feeling, I wish it would last
Don't wanna lose you for some evil I did in the past
You knew I fucked that bitch and you didn't react?
Girl, it's me and you, how simple is that?
Gave me all your love and now I'm giving it back
But I know, that

Girl you the worst
Yea, you know that you the worst
But I'm something you can't lose
If you just told me the truth, that'd be a first, but
Girl you the worst
Yea, you know that you the worst
Every time you say you sorry, everything you do just feel like it's rehearsed
Take me to euphoria according to the story of a warrior
Picturing my visions as you look inside my cornea

I been waiting so long
Been waiting to have you by my side (tell you "I love you")
I can't do no wrong, no you are an angel
With you by my side, you are my euphoria
And when you look in my eyes
The pain goes a-way, euphoria (euphoria)
You feel so damn good, I want you to know that
Just come take my hand closer so hear me out
We could go to the moon
Look at my eyes as we land
We're here now

Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh oh oh oh

Now when you lay in my arms the pain goes a-way, euphoria

Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh oh oh oh
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh oh oh oh
Euphoria
Euphoria
(Euphoria)

And when you're mine, I won't let you go
The pain, it can't stay (euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Uhhhhhh
Yeah, want you to feel it
I want you all to feel it
So step up on the mic and uhh
Show them what you got tiger

Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin' what am I supposed to do?
I've done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures
But I'm a hostage in my own world
And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'm a cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do, bring this dough, and I'm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice
Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected

What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here

I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever
I don't want to come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, who goin' to touch me now
And do we ever get to know the truth?
Cause everyone seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you
I'll be there to rescue you, problems you got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected

What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here

Uh, sittin' in my Bentley,  thinkin' bout these hoes
All I do is kill them, I kill them like Nicole
Simpson, flag crimson, smoke em' like Winstons
I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant
I'm lightin' up a stogie, It's longer than a hoagie
Situation's gettin' fishy and I don't eat anchovies
Fuck the world, kill em' all, she answer when I call
If the cops pull us over, she gon' hide it in her drawers
See I come from a place where stars never shine
And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined
Everybody gotta die, but I ain't everybody
If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard
I'm a pimp, I ain't lyin', but that is not important
I'm just tryna to buy time, but can't really afford it
Sayin' ain't that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad
I feel like money in the trash, like—
Whoa! Yeah, Young Mula Baby!

What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here
Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

(Fuck you)
I came for whoever is in charge
I suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard
They need some coffee, everybody’s sleeping on me
Going around door to door, setting off alarms
All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways (Lord have mercy)
I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant
You can see it from a scar face
Hidden in a dark place, swimming in the shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in an arcade
(Time crisis) Not a second to lose
I’m the motherfuckin' Bible, that’s forever the truth
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues
The devil with me and he tell me to shoot

Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do)
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)

Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday
Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway
Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
Hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I’m in it in an instant like replay
Broad’s a baton, pass it off like relay
Why I’m so mad on my B-Day?
She say “I thought you got sober”
And I say “I wish you’d stop being a bitch
And get to minding your business”
Told me “Money has changed you”
I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?
How’d I get so egotistical? I’m a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I’m only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it’ll forever be
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies

Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)

A goddess told me “good morning” when I woke up
(Fuck you)
You know I had a good morning when I woke up
(Fuck you)
Gotta thank God every morning then I woke up
(Fuck you)
Would you remember me if I never woke up?
Bye bye (Fuck you)
I've been a sinner, I’m just tryna stay
Warm through winter, and I’ll be on my way
I’m just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers
I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind

Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system
412-9….  is not available

“Hey man, I wish you were here, happy holidays
Uhm, I love ya. And I hope you have a good night / weekend
/ I hope I talk to you soon, alright, godspeed”


Oh yeah, I thought I’d have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sitting on millions
Reminiscing on times when we were so broke
And living in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I’d have it in the bag by now
I thought that we’d be kicking back by now
I know that life is a bitch, I know that life is a bitch
I thought we’d put her in a cab by now
But I’m stressing, I can’t relax
I swallow my pride and I’m hiding what’s making me mad
Everybody saying I need rehab
Cause I’m speedin' with a blindfold on and won’t be long
‘til they watching me crash
And they don’t wanna see that
They don’t want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Telling her they could have done more to help me
And she’ll be crying saying that she’ll do anything to have me back
All the nights I’m losing sleep, it was all a dream
There was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbing them dark times
Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up
Admit it’s a problem, I need a wake up
Before one morning I don’t wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I’m too obsessed with going down as a great one
But if you wait too long, they go find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter, to all my brothers, Most Dope, that’s forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain’t already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance I’ll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there’s a place
Where all my people worry free and everybody straight
Every devil don’t got horns, and every hero ain’t got capes
Opened up my eyes, shit, I’m finally awake, Good morning
Yeah, good morning

Yo Vin, it’s the morning, you gotta go to work
“alright”
Yo, you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo
(You good?)
“I’m straight, yo what’s good?” (when you going?)
You gotta pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?
“man, fuck that shit, I’ll skip”
You bout to go to work?
“mmm”
Ight, what time you gotta be at work?
“I don’t know…. soon”
You Democrat or Republican?
“Uuhh…I don’t know anymore”
Would you vote for a female president?
“I don’t care what gender or race you are”
Get high, breaking laws
Get high, breaking laws

Yeah, okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is banging like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like
Dracula
It's the young miraculous, mister love-to-grab-his-nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with forty courses, bunch of horny whores and fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon, man
I bring this to you like lalalalala-live man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell them "shhh" this middle finger sign for silence
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keeping quiet

Yeah, I been riding through the city
Blowing smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol, they looking out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Oh no (br-br-br-break the law)
La, la, la

So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit
But now I walk around with money and my hand on my dick
I think I'm special
I'm drinking whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out
One million, two million, shit I'm losing track now
Coming to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound,  turned that to a house
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here?
Spending all your time just getting high will drive you crazy
I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the 80's
Speeding down the freeway getting head in my Mercedes
Giving me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better
No pressure, dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola, have you ever been?
Shit I probably could've been the president

Yeah, riding through the city blowing smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol looking out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Oh no, (br-br-br-break the law)
La, la, la

Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Break the law, br-br-br-break the law
Break the law
Break the law
Break the law
La la la la la la la la la
I just be like fuck you, what you need?

You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'mma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'mma smile back, smile back

Tell them haters, call your army, bring your tanks
I'm a big boy with a big boy bank
Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet it's gon take a second
But once I start up my engine I'm gone, too fast to catch him
I'm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink
What I'm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days
Sweeter than creme brulee, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade
Elevate, Buddha shit. Cooler than what coolest is
Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it
Stupid bitch, keep on hatin', I'mma keep on doin' it
Spend a day as me, boy you couldn't get the shoes to fit

I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'mma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'mma smile back, smile back

You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'mma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'mma smile back, smile back

They used to tell me I was fake, they would hate, now they on my dick
Most Dope is my family, have respect for my conglomerate
Rollie on my wrist, I ain't rich, but I'm still coppin' shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'mma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball
After all, only get one life, so there's no time to stall
I'mma do it, stupid dudes with all exclusive shit to move with
Just a few kids tryna bullshit, still my boys I straight up grew with

I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'mma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'mma smile back, smile back
I give a fuck less and less everyday
The more you give a fuck, I guess the less you make (Money)
Homie we just out here tryna elevate
Heaven is a crime scene, stand behind the yellow tape
I started making money in eleventh grade
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space
Shit was so different in 2008
Growing pains, fill the open veins with Novocain
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain
I'm just rambling
You want war, send N64 Blitz champions (Sucker)
Out of space channeling, brain damaging
Heavy rain game cancelling, proud to be American
They tell me "Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?"

I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness

I'm a deranged motherfucker, took too many uppers
Now it's rush hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker
I stuck around for the past six summers
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya
We was in the attic you could smell the weed
Bitches getting naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissing bitches just like Ellen D
In the kitchen whipping biscuits, giving generously
I thank the lord I made it out, no STD
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs
They tell me "Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?"

I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness

Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good morning
It's the baby face Don Dada checking in
And I want you to know
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining
Know what I'm talking about
Don't ever become content because you will repent
Feel that, go get it
That's your life, go live it
Pass me my Hennessy and my Grand Marnier
If you will
Yo, I'm fucking zooted right now in the fucking bathroom, dog. And, you know what I'm saying, I'm just recording this shit cause I feel like I got so much fucking shit to say and like, you know what I'm saying, this is the only way that I'ma get it out

Yeah, can I get the little bit of reverb on my voice?
I'm trying to hide from something, I just don't know what
Oh, it's not sad baby, you know
(Between heaven and hell)
Yeah, um, I saw a mountain, you know across the horizon
When I got there realized it was just a pile of rocks
Yeah, so God damn

I wonder if everybody hope
That this song is not depressing as the last one was
Cause Heaven smell like Nag Champas
Come here darling, ash my blunt (Smoke)
Waiting on hallucination, ain't a single fact I trust (No)
Dear family, my sanity go down when my cash go up
Rap too much, how the fuck to get through the verse
I came from house parties
Find a bitch and go through her purse
All I need is a little good pussy and whole lot universe
I met God before I ever stepped into a church
And that motherfucker still owe me money
Ohhh I need a religion to follow
I swear to God that I got more problems
Than there is bitches in Carlow
Lord have Murciélago, yeah
And I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed
To look into my parents eyes when I'm scared to die
My eyes same color as a cherry pie
Woah, see I'm terrified
Crucifix heavy, who gon' carry mine?
Yeah, what's with all this talk about Hell and Satan
And sleep deprivation
If this is planet Earth, then my hell's a basement

Ascension
A brand new me
Yeah, yeah
Why you wanna do me like that, Miss Conception?
Between heaven and hell
What's between heaven and hell?
A brand new me
Oh it's a brand new me

Okay, if I could tell these kids one thing
Just make sure handle your business
A criminal leave no witness
And don't ever trust these bitches
What happened to your life when your house become a home
Where your children at? Where your children at?
You got two sons, all they do is fight
You up through the night like gimme-gimme-gimme that
Yeah, nice titties, got a pic, go and send me that
Sendak books, can you give her that?
Fuck rap, make a million off a shitty app
Yeah, smoke trees in the cab
Pittsburgh, show you where the city at
And don't forget that H, get you smacked in your face
Got so many sons, I was young, now they half my age
90K out in Portugal, smile on my face, backlit stage
My bitch batshit crazy and that shit fascinates me
Yeah, on my tongue where the tab is
And it burn like battery acid
I was in the backs of my classes
By the kids having asthma attacks
Cause he panicked every single time he sat on his glasses
Every Wonderland have a Alice
Yeah, but I'm a king God can I have a chalice
I'm demanding the truth, put your hands to the roof
Be a man, that's a challenge

Ascension
(Challenge, are you up for that challenge)
A brand new me
Yeah, yeah
(Yeah, everybody got to have balance)
Why you wanna do me like that, Miss Conception?
Between heaven and hell (Salvation)
What's between heaven and hell?
(And the underworld, welcome to Heaven
But I gotta keep that bitch waiting)
A brand new me (Fascinating)
Oh it's a brand new me
(And that's fascinating, please be a little patient)

Ooh, I ain't a doctor, could you be a little patient?
Yeah, be a little patient
Everything will be okay then, if you be a little patient
One world, one nation, done waiting
Yeah, yeah, um
Now I'm still sipping moonshine
We discovered a new high, me and Jerm done this a few times
Yeah, but who's high now
(I can't believe I done changed my life around)
Talk a lot of shit but will you die now
(I been wanting to cry over this shit. Every day I think about fucking dying)
What you gonna do when everybody die out, just go die out
Let's ride out
Be without fear in the face of your enemies
Be brave and upright that God may love thee
Speak the truth even if it leads to your death
Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong
This is your oath
Yeah, yeah so how's it feel?
Can you feel it?

Polo pajamas, I think I made it
I show my mom my first millions, she damn near fainted
The rich and famous, so nice to make your acquaintance
The legends put out the latest, I feel that it sound outdated
I'm the hardest working person in the universe
Temptation victim to the church of Lucifer
Internet rappers ain't shit when no computers work
You spent your whole advance on two chains and a Gucci verse (a Gucci verse?)
I'm the greatest, admit it, I'm the greatest
And I don't hold a grudge against anybody who hated
I'm underrated, don't fit on nobody's playlist
If I ain't in your top 10 then you're a racist
Cocaine ether creates a strange creature
They wasn't hearing me 'till I fucked with a Brainfeeder
I'm still playing it out the same speakers
I did it all without a Drake feature!

So many things that I've created
But this right here might be my favorite
They ask me how I feel, I say "amazing"
I feel amazing
So many things that I've created
But this right here might be my favorite

Brand new home, I think I made it
Key to the city, I keep to open the gates with
A briefcase with a million under the pavement
That's just on some rainy day shit, yeah
The kids getting murdered that I grew up with
They shooting up doing drugs or they doing nothing
My girl's parents still living out in the hood
I come through in that new Beamer like the shit all good
Damn, I'm just a human let me make mistakes
Shit has changed ain't little Malcolm with a baby face
Even my homies tell me take a break
They know it ain't their place, and this a day I hate to waste
Trying to be a legend by tomorrow
They say I can't, I'm determined to prove em' wrong though
I'm not perfect but they ain't either
I did it all without a Jay feature!

We never talk, we always way too busy fuckin'
I'll think of something to say, I always do
I'm in love with the way that you say my name
Every time it sound brand new

Only if you be my...
It's alright, it's okay

Yeah, okay, and time will tell
If I'm alive and well, cause when I'm by myself
I find that I keep flying high, sometimes I must remind myself
That change is more than pennies laying on the floor inside the well
You cross my mind, do not apologize for being fine as hell
I'm spinning here inside your spell, my mind has start to wander
I missed a day, I stay up late admiring your posture

And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me

Baby you could be my...
Yeah, well okay, it's alright, it's okay
And baby you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay

There's no more you or me, we are we, yes we are
Yes we are sweet babe
And I can see, I can see, so much better
I can see
And carefully, precious things fall apart
Just let them be, let it be, forever
Oh, loving me, in spite of me
Bless your heart, bless your heart
I can breathe, I can breathe so much better, yeah
I won't let anything tear us apart, no, no, no
We are we, we are we, forever

Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Okay, well you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
You can be my...
Yeah, well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you could be my...

You gotta deal with Mac Miller, bitch
Hehehehahah
You feel like you're alone, Will? You have a soulmate? Somebody who challenges you. I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you—touches your soul. You can't give back to them, you know. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're always afraid to take the first step because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road. You can do anything you want, you are bound by nothing...

Yeah, are you my soulmate?
My angel, what do you want with me?
Too high, slow pace
My eyes closed, your body all I see
I think you're too divine for my human mind
When I'm with you, what do you do? Bring me to life
No matter what, one day everyone dies
You think you a God 'til you run out of time
Yeah, when you're gone, what will you leave behind?
Yeah, do I belong sometime soon, where goes my mind?

You were the one to show me
Divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our songs, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here...

Yeah, why do you stay on my case?
I try to make you feel okay
Do you know I'm in pain?
I give you clues, you misconstrue
You continue to push me far away
Why don't you come on in?
It's like you forgot my face
I just wanna taste of everything you're made of
We ain't (nothing)
Cut the strings, my balloon, watch me fly
Yeah, when are you coming through to free my mind?
Are you happy with your life?
Can I come and satisfy? Open up, let me inside
When you take off all your clothes, I'm under your control
Rollin' up, you get me high

You were the one to show me
Divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our songs, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here...

Cover Art:
Uhh, ch'yeah, uh
Dedicated too, this dedicated to... fuck it

Uh, I got a pocket full of posies
Some devil with a pitchfork keep talking like he know me
I'm psychopathic, low key, my hyperactive dome piece
Get no sleep, ill as fuck, the hospitals seem so weak
I stood before an Angel as he told me bout the glory
Put me in a room of people, how the fuck could I be lonely?
I only get money, these labels tryna clone me
Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete
So, I try to keep 'em in my head
It's sad to see when everything that you believe is dead
Word to Heavy D, and rest in peace to all that come and pass
Life is good sometimes, but it just doesn't last
A bunch of stress, you see this mic is like my punching bag
Rock 'n' roll, drugs and cash, you softer than a bubble bath
Sucka ass mothafucka, mothafucka's sediment
Doper than the shit that killed Chris Tucker in Dead Presidents
Desert rhymes, homie, riding beats, I'm on a camel
I'm way too hot to handle, life a beach, I brought my sandals
You want a war? I got a lot of ammo
You ain't a soldier cause you rocking camo
Young Rambo, hundred million fans though
And I do it big, you a iPod Nano
Fire on wax, look like I rock candles
Yeah you got a show, but you ain't on my channel

That's HBO bitch, you gotta pay for that, your channel's free
(I'm gonna fucking kill you)
Um, Imaxin' shit mothafucka, yeah, suck my dick

Hey, ayo, I'm 'bout to start gambiling with Ambien, I'm dutch smoking
That's a strike but fuck bowling, I could tear a pin of Maryland
See, I'm American, apparently it's damaging
To be in front of cameras in your underwear with Marilyn
Monroe, looking dumb hoes who want to much dough
And come close to have you straight tripping when you jump rope
Don't rock the love boat, this business fucking cut throat
And it's gonna crack if you just paint the wall with one coat
Rooms filled with blunt smoke, peep me through the fog
These rappers who be hating probably need to get a job
See, me I'm with my squad, getting money, living comfortable
I know a couple hoes who model, but they ugly though
Fuck a toast, y'all is fucking broke, cut ya throat
Judging me is nothing dope, boy you lying under oath
God made the world, why did man make the scriptures?
And if he created Lennon, why'd he go and make a Hitler?
I could take a photo, but I'd rather paint a picture
Of the one Laurence Fishburne, we'll shoot up all you hipsters
I'm from Pittsburgh, that's black and gold
If my skin gets filled up, I'mma tat my soul
Running out of paper, writing on my hand
Hundred thousand haters writing 'bout my jams
Want a number one independent album? I'm your man
I'mma hit Preme and leave you all right where you stand

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Sample
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

You hide your skin like you're shy or there's something wrong
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs
So finally I made a fuckin' song
And now she comin' closer
Hope she crawls, she wanna jump my bones
You want it don't ya?
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break
You need to smell your sweet aroma
See I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
My dick on business trips
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river
In the Caribbean

It's okay that you like it babe (I like it baby)
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way (this way)
To live this way baby baby (ooh baby)
Chillin' with the AC

That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart

Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine yeah, too divine
Who am I? Well, I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Blew your, blew your mind, hot as June, July
I wanna make you waterfall
Girl you my painting, you my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now, let's go get lost
Just I've been way too hot for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold?
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
I swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was; man I'm broke
But now they know me and what I don't need
You gon' see it's gon' be what it's gon' be

That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart

These hoes
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes
"I know what happens to you, me and everyone else
When they supposedly die
It's this passage around the great loop"
This music go with my funeral
Music go with my funeral

Said I was raised inside this gritty city
Riding through, you probably miss me
My bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me
All this sins be more than shitty, I just pray the lord forgive me
Doing drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me
My side-bitch is sort of pretty but she got enormous titties
Know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new Porsche or Bentley
Had a few abortions, unfortunately, I forced them
Lord knows I turn a child to an orphan when I'm touring
I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be
Sit at home and drink by myself, my thoughts harassing me
Actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't getting back to me
A shame that my tragedy, my masterpiece, yeah
Trapped inside these dreams of mine
Just trying to get some peace of mind
Yeah, I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine
So you'll never get a piece of mind

It's the last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life
This the motherfucking last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life

See we swallowed in this web of lies, never try to exercise
You used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised
I heard the legends never died
Oh this lonely hell of mine
There never was a better time to better myself
Forever I melt and float away like waves in the ocean
Staring inside of Heaven's eyes, the gates will never open
I'm smoking on this field of hope, waiting till my deal gets closed
I keep getting hotter but all I seem to feel is cold
22 don't feel so old but I think I'm 82
You mean to tell me God took seven days and all he made was you?
I'm out here with the kangaroos, making danger, break the rules
Celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused
Happiness I take from you, searching for the naked truth
I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you
Bitch, check out the butterfly
If you the truth then what the fuck am I?
Yeah

It's the last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life
This the motherfucking last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life

So where are you going?
Where are you headed?
Where are you going?
Can I come? Can I come?
Take your time, when talkin' to a nigga, I don't waste none
Knock you off your feet and then I flee before the jakes come
Sick of hearin' cases from these niggas who ain't face none
But I'ma be the nigga that they feelin' when the day come
Thirsty for the pay, young niggas led astray
Stray bullet hit my brother in his mothafuckin' face
What's fate when a person don't deserve what he get?
Shootin' reckless at the father, almost murdered the kid
Or is it karma for the shit that both the parents had did?
Ain't embarrassed where I'm livin', we get merit for kills
From a family of niggas that was veteran skilled
Voted heartless cause my momma made me part of the guild
Deals made, sellin' thrills paid the bills at the crib
Drag him down by the river, he'll be missin' for years
And them funerals was usual, ain't sheddin' no tears
Knew the fallen had it better off than most of us did
Cause shit, Heaven knows, Heaven's gates prolly closed
And these hoes in a race for the gold
We was raised on that fork in the road
No food on our plate, just the meals that we stole

Yeah, oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, um

I spit that prayer hand emoji, that shit that injured Kobe
The holiest of holy, Nick Nolte in some Oakley's
That's a flex though, cover up the issues that I kept close
Sober I can't deal, I'm in the corner with my head low
Runnin' from my shadow, never ending chase
Ease the pain and the battle that's within me
Sniff the same shit that got Whitney, the high heel depression
My temple feel the metal comin' out the Smith & Wesson, bang
Say a prayer, leave my brains on the tile floor
My bitch hate me, always tell me I should smile more
Off them drugs that hit you in your spinal cord
This the shit I need to keep the climate warm
Wish I could get high, space migration
Pretend I can just fly to great vibrations
The magazines need a quote
Now I'm gone, sorry I don't even know, yo

Woah-oh-oh, yeah
And this pain, and this pain
And this pain, and this pain
Mixed up with this rain, this rain
This rain, this rain, woah-woah-woah-oh-oh
Yeah, oh-woah-oh, yeah
Yeah, 9th Wonder
Woah! Yeah Woah! Yeah Okay, Okay
Yeah, Uh

We in between heaven and hell
Fuck a 9 to 5, I'd rather end up dead or in jail
American ninja to these obstacles
No stopping me, we on the move
Your mouth running like a prostitute's
Keep your head to yourself
I work harder than anybody you know
I'm done with tricks, don't need no money to blow
Deadly aim, self contained
Superstar, they yell the name
Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain
The P fitted on my head though
I'm too high, you can't reach me with the cell phone
No goodbyes, no hellos
You don't want this life I live
You'd rather had the wife and kid
Shooting dice with Jesus Christ, put 20 on the midnight
To everyone who sell me drugs
Don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hoping not to join the twenty seven club
Just want the coke dealer house with the velvet rug
Fuck the world there's no one else but us

Everything we think we love
It ain't nothing but a brand name
To everyone but us
It ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name
Baby, this right here is hand made

I got brothers, I don't need no friends
My shoes off I'm comfortable, I'm chilling smoking weed again
I'm from the 'Burgh, not the burbs
Investigating my nation, homie we ain't concerned
Went from the 412 out to the 310
Went from the pavement in my basement to them yellow brick roads
See, I was on my Ps & Qs like L-M-N-O
But kicking bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em go home, I don't know
I was in the crib with my different shit
Simple living, I'm a hypocrite
Cause I'm filthy rich, I got businesses
Been had wifey's, have mistresses
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listening
The war ain't winning, it just beginning
And I've been 'bout Sparta like Michigan
I got stats, they got opinions, I got facts
The bro left home, but he came back
This what raised me, made me rap
PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately
See, I left, they call me shady
I'm a white rapper, they always call me shady
Got no idea what I'm contemplating, I guess...

Everything we think we love
It ain't nothing but a brand name
To everyone but us
It ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name
Baby, this right here is hand made

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Yeah
La, la, la, la
Everyday we love, love
Good morning
La, la, la, la
Good morning
And everyone want-
Good morning
La, la, la, la
Good morning
Yeah
See a person like me, smoke weed 'till I hallucinate
I don't know why, crazy right?
This party was dope, that shit got played quick
Yo but the bitches are freaky here

Kool-Aid and frozen pizza
It's a work of art, I ain't talking Mona Lisa
Dream of rocking crowds, see me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more
Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi
Can't believe they eyes, swear its just a mirage
Still got my training wheels in the garage
But I ain't gonna need those, I'ma go hard
So far I've done pretty well for myself
Couple trophies on the shelf so what else
Could I want that I don't have yet
Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet
So I can go anywhere (anywhere) anywhere (anywhere)
Cali for the kush, cause boy I know there's plenty there
Bout to be in music stores everywhere but not yet
They can't understand my concept
I been climbing up the great wall, haven't had a fall yet
These blogs gotta know I'm on next
Clean conscience, good Samaritan
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing 'em
If you didn't know, well I'm from the Burgh
Everything I drop recorded by Big Jerm
I smoke herb and I make music
I don't even talk about it boy, I just do it
Everybody got their own opinion, the reasons why they feeling 'em
You must admit he's killing 'em, running off adrenaline
Waiting for the game to wanna let him in, so open up
The boy a barrel of a smoking gun
Whether I'm old or young, the chosen one
I got a hundred billion flows to come
I hope you know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along
My weed bag empty, bottle at it's last drop
I'm feeling like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make cousin
So why the fuck you bugging?
