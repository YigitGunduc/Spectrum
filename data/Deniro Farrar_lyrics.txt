Ain't nobody ready to die for this shit
Glock man, Glock

Niggas saying that they thugging

Rappers sell they soul for a bag of that money
If you pussy I'm gon know

Police can't touch me
Them bitches wanna fuck me
PO wanna lock a nigga fucker up
Middle finger to the laws i don't give a fuck
Tell them bitches if they want me they can come and get me
I ain't going by myself, they coming with me
They trying to send me and my niggas ...
...the police ...shooting niggas ...
I don't need no introduction, niggas know me
Ain't no secret, I don't fuck with the police
Ronald Regan is the reason why the dope cheap
Now the feds in our hood doing dope sweeps
Tell the judge i got kids and we gon eat
So if you give me 50 years what they gon be?
Guess the apple don't fall far from the tree
I ain't finna write no statement, fuck copping plea
Mandatory sentence make it hard for a g
My lil brother caught a body, he got 23
Hard trying to find a job with a felony
Why you thinking that I’m breaking pounds of this weed

Get you hit up for a fee, I ain't got to beef
Niggas gotta pop e just to pop and squeeze
And you can tell the police please to back up off my N-U-T's (appreciate)
To my PO and the judge they can suck a dick
Militant nigga, i'm on that soldier shit
My niggas down to die that's who i'm rolling with
And if she ain't got no mind then i don't fuck a bitch
Once i liberate the people then it's over with
Had them killers at your door on some Jehovahs shit
Tell the government to come get me if they really want me
I did this song right here for ...
Put us on the news saying that we thugs
Police start shooting us in cold blood
Feds trying to take our brothers from their babies
99% conviction rating, you know that's shady
They said government assistance made our people lazy
But if they take that shit away how is she gon feed them babies?
If the record labels want me then they have to pay me
I got that bag now I'm dealing school for our babies
Life ain't promised to a nigga where I come from
Where I come from made me beast
Graduated from the struggle and I made it out the streets
Liberated my mind now it's time I teach
Life ain't promised to a nigga where I come from
Here to save everybody I can
But you gotta understand that I'm only one man
And we ain't no different
You just like me

Yall don't be doing shit
Look nigga, my daddy wasn't shit
My momma wasn't shit
Chances are nigga, I ain't gon' be shit

Ride through the city where I come from
Where the kids see the killers as a role model
Don't nobody understand them and they feel alone
Hit the block, bought a Glock now they feel they grown
Unaware that he gon' get a bullet in his head
By another black male cause he living well
Got rich quick made it from a crack sale
Now he just another dead nigga shit oh well
But it's funny how we run into karma
Same boy killed he used to serve the boy's momma
And his daddy was the brick man so he got it honest
Never had it honest cause he never had a soul
Immune to the system, of the cold world
My little niece still sick, that my brother's little girl
If he lose her it would kill him
So it fuckin' with my world
Shit I'm drinking liquor every night till I hurl

Life ain't promised to a nigga where I come from

Come ride through the city where I come from
Where them young niggas riding round with them drums
They ain't playing no games and they going on
Till the feeling when they kill and they so young
Everybody where I'm from ride with a Glock
You better keep it if you slip then you gettin' shot
Watch the murder rate rise while the bodies drop
Whole hood seen it happen, we don't talk to the cops
Sick of funerals and going to these wakes
Killing off each other while they laugh in our face
Judge gave 50 years for a dope case
While he watch the momma cry, tears roll down her face
Told him that he innocent, the judge don't believe 'em
Put 'em on trial then she threw away his freedom
No money for a lawyer
And he a felon look the judge in the eye
And I told that bitch he ain't tellin'

Life ain't promised to a nigga where I come from
Where I come from made me beast
Graduated from the struggle and I made it out the streets
Liberated my mind now it's time I teach

Yeah, yeah that shit was fucked up man but you know life ain't promised where we from my nigga
Shit yeah, free Tune nigga, stay yellin' that shit
One hunned
Sick of putting work in the plastic
Off-white work, Michael Jackson
Sick and tired of running, ducking, dodging these cases
Down to kill a nigga when it comes to big faces
Going in a fuck nigga mouth, no braces
White girl cocaine crazy
Let her snort lines till' her body start shaking
Feelin like a raver in the 80's
Can't get money, these fuck niggas talking
If a nigga cross em', my shooters gone off em'
Living like kings, maneuver like bosses
Want everythang, we ain't takin' no losses
Light turn green, better hope you ready
Selling break-down my nigga that's petty
Straight drop, dope, make the fiends go crazy
Stealin' from they family, abandon they babies
First of the month, fuck you, pay me
Gotta get money, I just had babies
Gotta get money, cuz the fuckin' rent due
Aim at ya' head, nigga won't miss you
Ridin' in the rental hand on my tool
Paranoia like a bitch, still doing what I do
I don't really want to, but I feel like I gotta
Main bitch be holdin' me down, she a rider
Don't need scales for the work, I'm an eyer
Straight from the mudhouse, built this empire
Couldn't keep a job, shit, I always got fired
Turn to the streets, then a nigga got hired
Servin' all this work, got my name on fire
If your bitch made it, somebody gone try her
Make a couple mill, maybe then, I'll retire
Smoke 10 blunts, won't get no higher, bitch

Tired of robbin' (Tired of hustlin')
Sick of dodgin' (Tired of duckin')
Sick of fussin' (Tired of fightin')
Done with rappin' (Tired of writin')

Sick of putting weed in the bag, smokin' cigarettes till my mouth taste ashy
Can't see me, fuck nigga need glasses
30 rounds in the Glock 40 this plastic
Tryna' make my last 20 stretch like elastic
Hood hot and the police harrasin'
Threw me on the ground and they talk to me nasty
Holes in my shoes and my blue jeans ashy
Can't get a bitch, Imma live with Ashley
She in love with money, so the situation tragic
I'm a broke nigga, so we always clashin'
Dropped outta school, shit I was barely passin'
Used to be an underdog, now I'm like a captain
Grew up in the streets, yeah, I never had a daddy
Payed a couple bills, tryna' make momma happy
But she say money never bring satisfaction
How the fuck you know? We ain't ever had it
Flyin' on my rug and I'm feelin' like Aladdin
Smokin' this kush, making me lag
Heart start beatin', heart start collapsin'
Baby on the way, bout to be a pappy
Gotta leave the trap and make this rap happen
Ain't gotta job, she always askin'
Shit I'm tryna' make lil baby girl happy
But she ain't happy nigga, but I'm happy with her
Work hard tryin' not to be a savage nigga
Sick of livin' my life like an average nigga
Spendin' money really hard, tryna stack it nigga
Sick of puttin this work in the baggin' nigga
Play with my money, imma smash it nigga
Chasing this cash got me so tired
Smoke 10 blunts won't get no higher
Bitch

Yo, Deniro Farrar
Peaceful music, nigga
Know that
Every morning I wake up
I look to the skies above and thank God for another day
Every night before I go to sleep
I look up to the stars and I pray
It don’t matter if you a scared nigga
A real nigga or the mother of a dead nigga
You still look to the sky when you pray
Know that

Birds chirpin', druggers lurkin', tryin' to find they crack rock
I’m in the kitchen helping my little niece pack up her lunch box
Still do or die 'round these parts so my gun cocked
Never know who might approach while standin' at her bus stop
Kiss her on the forehead, tell her make her uncle proud
Right after I hurt a nigga I fire up my blunt of loud
Now it's time I hit the block, take my chances sellin' rock
I'm already fire hot, just had a run-in with the cops, yo
(They look at the sky)
Staring off into the sky, smoking kush until I'm high
Watching my life pass me by, I’m still tryna' figure why
My mama serving fast food, she work until her body tired
Do it all tomorrow, got too much pride to borrow
I’m selling drugs to my fam with no remorse or sorrow
Just tryin' to buy some time cause we ain't promised tomorrow
My cousin's car got repoed cause he ain’t pay his condo
I'm knee-deep in the dope game getting money in my cargoes

Reminiscent 'bout them days
Holding hands with my mama walking on that playground
Now I’m caught up in that drama
Just a statistic, upliftin' niggas spirits
I was born with the gift to paint these pictures with my lyrics
I've been diagnosed the sickest
With none of y'all permission
I used to get beat with switches
Now we beat niggas pretendin'
I'm gone off that gremlin and arms reaching my semi
Paranoid, schizophrenic
Pray to Lord ya'll forgive me

Shit, I’m just a lost bird flying on the wrong path
My nigga with them chickens make them jump back a whole half
Feedin' pigeons with my niece
I'm tryin' to help her with her math, birds of a feather flock together
I’m so fucking glad
I turned out the way I did, without the help of my dad
Now I’m all alone, blowing strong in my bachelor's pad
Penthouse on the top floor, I can’t see shit but these birds
They told me that I could fly, now my body on the curb
Word

Every night I hit my knees
I just pray that god turns me into a bird
I fly away (x2)
Know that
Lord, forgive me ‘cause the way I’m living
They say what goes around comes around
I’m gonna get what’s coming to me
Guess I’ll be strapped up till they lay me down
And I done did too much to say
I never go to church and barely pray
Lately I’ve been going through some things
Hell, what the fuck I’m supposed to say?
‘Cause I just had two baby boys
I’m always calling their mama’s out their name
When I get caught in my emotions
Lord, I swear I’m tryna make a change
Ain't wrote my brother Tune in the month
But I’m always texting with these hoes
Feel bad whenever he call my phone
He had a court and I ain’t even show
And my little brother looking up to me
Lord, I swear I ain’t no role model
My uncle a fucking alcoholic
Can’t even eat unless he got a bottle
I been stressing about that money lately
It got me ‘bout to rob a fucking bank
And my mama fuck with bitches now
I could judge her, but I really can’t
‘Cause the way I’m living ain’t no better
I said the way I’m living ain’t no better
I just got in beef with what’s his name
So now I’m riding strapped with my Beretta

Laying in my bed, can’t get sleep
Eyes wide open and I’m staring at the ceiling
99 problems but I really got a million
You don't know my struggle so don't tell me that you feel it
Spit it from the heart, I know they gonna feel it
I was born real so cowards gonna feel me
Watching my back ‘cause I know they wanna kill me
Don’t go nowhere without my semi
Daddy was a killer so the bloodline in me
Heart of a lion even though a nigga skinny
Come to my hood and you gonna see plenty
Matchbox Chevys with the hubcap missin'
Niggas on dope walk around all timid
Dope dealer pass through the hood in a Bentley
Never gave back to the hood where he from
So the niggas from the block where he from gonna get it
Niggas get money and they act like bitches
Niggas get money and they act like bitches
Till they head get bust and they ass need stitches
Blinded by the greed so you better pay attention
Money don't make you real, my nigga
Better learn the value of a motherfucking dollar
'Fore them young hungry niggas break you off something proper
City of the Angels where they ride with them choppers
Eat, shit, sleep and even die with the chopper
I ain’t got nowhere to go, my nigga
Got beat down to the floor, my nigga
Hurt so bad and it show, my nigga
They kept saying that I wouldn't be shit
‘Cause I grew up so poor, my nigga
Well I’mma tell y'all like my nigga tell me
Water seeds long enough and they'll grow my nigga
Laying in my bed, can’t get sleep
Eyes wide open and I’m staring at the ceiling
Never go to church and my momma’s feelings hurt
Praying at night ‘cause she know that I’m sinning
Best coming so you know I gotta get it
Money coming fast so you know that’s how I’m spending
I ain't got credit so the whips I'm in when I drop out work boy you know that they rented
Unmarked car keep riding through the hood, with the Feds in the town and they might be in it
Niggas on tha westside just got bopped with a couple of 'em blocks so they might be snitching
Calling my phone, wanna talk about business
Ain't it fucked up because I smell something fishy
Everyone's fucked, tryna handle my business
Trigger finger itching and my eyeballs twitchin
All this work in the goddamn kitchen
Everytime I cook up, a nigga get nauseous
Peepin out my blinds because the chopper feelin cautious
Runnin from the law, got a nigga so exhausted
That's all I know my nigga, young hardhead and it shows my nigga
Money be the root of all evil, you gotta watch your people Sometimes you don't know them niggas
But that's how it goes my nigga
Got beat down to the floor my nigga
Hurt so bad and it show, my nigga
Lick went wrong off both my niggas
They kept saying that I wouldn't be shit
‘Cause I grew up so poor, my nigga
Well I’mma tell y'all like a nigga tell me
Water seeds long enough and they'll grow my nigga
So many days go by
Ain't enough minutes in an hour
Ain't enough bullets in my chopper
Smoked my last blunt of sour
And it's so many days go by
Ain't enough months in a year
Lost my nigga this year
So I thank God I'm here

365 in a year, 60 minutes in an hour
36 oz.'s in a whole key so 28 grams in an hour
Chasing money and power, yeah, chasing money and power
Chain smoking my sour, serving bars of that powder
Then I take a whole key, rock it up to the shake, jack a nigga for the plate of that sour
Fuck nigga, you a coward, AK bullets going shower (bang bang!)
On any nigga block, bitch niggas get chopped if you pussy niggas kill one of ours
Lost my dog and it hurt me, I didn't get tell him "bye"
I ain't gotta tell y'all why homicide on my mind
Momma tell me "just pray, and everything going be fine"
Well momma, I ain't even got time
Too busy writing these rhymes, busting down pounds of this pine
So corrupted by crime


I'm just watching my days go by, all my time just fly
Momma stressed out cause the bills still coming and she lost here job, oh my
What the fuck we going do? Yeah, what the fuck we going do?
I was only 16, had hoops dreams said, "fuck that" and I dropped out of school
Got my pack and I loaded my tool, selling dope what I do
I ain't telling y'all that's cool, I ain't telling y'all that's cool
Cause if I knew what I knew right now back then would've stayed my ass in school
Momma need help paying rent, and my lil' bro need new shoes
And my ex-girl cut me loose, yeah, my ex-girl cut me loose
Judge giving niggas like 25 years, that's a nigga lynching with no noose
I guess life's a catch 22, sell dope and you lose
Come walk a mile in my shoes, see all the bullshit I go through
It's called gentrification
It's what happens when the property value of a certain area is brought down
Huh? You listening?
To bring the property value down
They can buy the land at a lower price
Then they move all the people out
Raise the property value
And sell it at a profit

I'm just a boy from the hood
I feel like Furious Styles
Gentrification in our ghetto this nation is ours
We built this shit
Yeah, yeah we built this shit

Losing our ghetto but we don't even know it
Only use the curb for the liquor we pawn
Nigga got shot now it's time to mourn
Is what it is baby life move on
Gotta love struggle cause it made me strong
Whole Foods in the hood now the rent got raised
But I'm still living off minimum wage
Nigga can't even afford to stay
Next thing you know they gon' own the block
Shit too high for the mom and pop
Stores we was raised on on the block
Now we gotta make way for a coffee shop
Can't take shit so they buy the land
Living next door to the fireman
And a couple with a dog but they don't even speak
Walking round acting like they better than me
Cause they make six figures with a college degree
I grew up around Hades and apartments to me
Steady jacking up the price but you gotta be cheap?
Motherfuckers ain't fooling me
I love my skin and I love my soul
We was all slaves that's the lie they told
We started out kings with diamonds and gold
But they took our shit baby ain't that cold?


Where we gon' live if it ain't the hood?
Can't move up cause a nigga poor
Still in a recession and the jobs is low
Only other option is slang some blow
Three strike rule better think again
Kicking us out and they moving in
Pushing us all to the side of the city
Full of liquor stores and the water's shitty
School fucked up they don't teach the kids
Bout who they is or what we did
Alien ain't build them pyramids
We the ones started the beauty supply
People bought it out now prices are high
Everything around me gentrified
Better wake up nigga open your eyes
Go and get high then you eat Popeyes
But there ain't enough time to lay on our side
Cross they fingers cause they hope we die
Must've forgot we was born to survive
Only in the hood when you need a vote
Or fucking our women in exchange for dope
Same old shit it ain't changing though
Feeling like God my only hope


We are African
And we happen to be in America
We're not American
We are a people who formerly were African who were kidnapped and brought to America
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock
The rock was landed on us
Yeah
COD 2 nigga
Free Tune
If'it ain't right, it ain't right

And I've been chasing this money so long

Bitch can't get shit from me with my peter
In the kitchen with the fish where I'm clutchin' my heater
Fam by my seater but nigga then I beat'er
And she do what I tell her cause she know that I don't need'er
Got a crib in NY with a pus and the reefer
Got my bands off I ain't gotta pull em out
And I don't rob reals cause they make me stand out
Broke ass niggas always callin' for a handout
Come with that fuckery and it'll be a man down

And I've been chasing this money so long
That a nigga ain't had no sleep
Residue on the scale from the powder
AK by the dope for the beef
And I've been chasing this money so long

Chasing...
Three o'clock in the morning, leaving the club horny
Callin' any broad I think woke and I'm on it

Trying to maintain that shit that be hangin' with Patricia
But Patricia always hatin' on me cause I fucked her sister
Mr. Hit-'Em-And-Never-Call-'Em-Back, a cold-hearted man
Hoping I can reach Tamika cause she down with all of that
Smack her ass, pull her hair, she love to get it from the back
Hit me with a text sayin' that she wanna sex me
I told her, "Bring some lingerie" if she wanna impress me
Bitch, fuck all that talking, just get over here and neck me
She started reachin' for the door like she offended by the joke
Settin' her bra down on her bed and started kissing on her throat
Getting closer to the pussy, ready to get in this shit
Pull her panties to the side, and bitch is on her period
Tell me you ain't serious, this shit is priceless
Told her, "Get to sucking, bitch, and do it like you like it"
Dumbass broad is stupid but I wish I was a psychic
If I'd known she was bleedin' then she wouldn't have got invited
Got a nigga all excited, erectin' up my private

I can't get no pussy so right now I'm feelin' violent
I know you trying to go and hope your pussy got some malice
I'm dead-ass serious, bitch I ain't smiling
Then I hit her with the "what the fuck you mean 'no?'
I ain't trying to hear this shit
You ain't trying to suck the dick, then I'mma call the other bitch"
Acting like you ain't a dog, I know you let my cousin hit
Playing like you had to do it when you know you ain't shit
Nympho for the sex, can probably take eight dicks
Scrolling through these bitches like an iPod playlist
Ran across Jasmine, that redbone waitress
Ass like Trina with some lips like Megan
Good, classy broad but she still good
Layin' right under her man and I really wish she could
Come over and fuck me on my sofa
I'm almost out of options and I'm feelin' like it's over
For me to get some pussy cause it's almost a quarter to six and my
Hand in my dick, thinkin' about using my wrist
Pissed about this shit, I can't let it happen like this
Seen a call that I missed, and I hope that it's worth it
Hesitate to call her back cause she say she a virgin
But today you 'bout to learn how to bust that pussy open
I ain't jokin'

Heard a knock at the door, thankin' God like I'm spiritual
Hopin' that she wanna fuck, the situation critical
Gotta play my cards right and treat it like it's pivotal
Plus I'm drunk as hell and I'm a horny individual
Netflix on the couch, chillin' in the living room
Started kissing on her neck, she had the nerve to tell me move
I hit her with the stare face, "bitch, what you tryna do?"
She told me she just wanna chill
I told her, "oh, for real?
It's six o'clock in the morning, ho, and you know what it is
This ain't no talk-show, and you ain't look like Oprah
So hike that dress up like a sinner bitch and let me stroke ya"
I heard her suck her teeth, then she rolled the fuck over
Turned the TV off on her ass, hit her with the cold shoulder
This story far from over, and I am far from average
She say she practice abstinence, waitin' for the marriage
I told her "let me eat the pussy, we ain't gotta have sex"
Stop right before she came, her legs still around my neck
Now her ass drippin' wet, fiendin' for a cigarette
Ask me if I had a rubber, all I could think was yes
Ran her tongue down my neck, started suckin' on my meat
"Tell me 'fore you 'bout to come so I can spit it in the sheets"
Hit her with the OK, but you know how I do and freak
Before you know it I'm bustin', jizzin' all on her teeth
She punch me in the stomach, she mad, I guess it's time to go
Walked her to the door and said peace and fell asleep
(Bitch)
KOBK the murder gang
Free Tune, that's my bro

What's murder to a nigga doing homicides?
You a bitch nigga I can see it in your eyes
What's pussy to a nigga that be getting pussy?
Living like a G bitch I think I'm Big Tookie

Bitch I'm a king no crown my nig
Play games get laid down my nig
I make $350 off a zone of the loud
So this $5,600 off a pound my nig
I can hit the trap and break it down my nig
Got a plug out of town on the pounds of mid
So what's pussy to a nigga that be getting it?
I'm running from committment so I'm hitting it and quitting it
Hoes on my line they be blowing me up
You ain't getting shit bitch, but a dick to suck
Wildin' out in public, I don't give no fuck
I ain't down with the price, so I'm sticking you up
Hitting licks with my nigga, then we splitting it up
High as hell, then I'm looking for a bitch to fuck
Heard the feds got the tool, now they're picking you up
But real niggas stay solid, no snitching with us, bitch


Fuck nigga, hol' up
Pump your motherfucking breaks with the ho stuff
That's how niggas get their whole shit swole up
Turn into freeze pops when they see me roll up
I'm out the window with a choppa, they're ain't no love
With my thugs, and they mouth full of gold slugs
And they strapped up, everybody got guns
Acting like a bitch, and we'll treat you like one
Running trains on these hoes just for the fun
I'm the realest, and these other rappers bubblegum
I ain't finna turn rasta, fuck bumping gums
These are niggas, they ain't fighting shit, they busting guns
And they won't stop shooting til the job done
My lil' a partner caught a body, now he on the run
Looking at 30 years and he only 20
Rest in peace Big Tookie and my nigga Timmy
Screaming "fuck the other side!" cause that thug in me
I be leaning like a bitch when that mud in me
That extendo on that pistol nigga don't tempt me
33 inside the .40, boy, that's Scottie Pippen
That's for any nigga thinking about fucking with me
Got yo bitch at the crib and she fucking with me
Got my niggas on a mission to come serve ya
Can't sleep, nigga, dreaming about murder


Aye nigga
Here's the distinction between animalism and humanity
An animal like a goat has no sense of his impending death
Although his brother goat is being slaughtered
The goat is being lured by the green grass offered to him
He stands peacefully waiting to be slaughtered himself
On the other hand
A man see his fellow man being slaughtered or killed by an enemy
He has no choice but to fight to save his brother's life, or fight to save his own
Clocking in clocking out, another day another dollar
You can't even pump your gas, without some niggas trying to holla
I just want you to know I noticed (4x)
You go to school And go to work. Cash your check then go home single parent all alone. God damn girl you strong
I just want you to know I noticed (4x)

It's 5 in the morning, and you ain't had no sleep
Cause your youngest baby teething, just 1 of your lil 3
Your baby dad is a statistic, another dead beat
Shit my daddy was the same, so my Moma raised me
But she still found a way, to overcome a break free
Working job after job, 1 or 2 or maybe 3
To put food on the table, making due with ends meet
So I know about that pain that you feeling, and it's deep
And he beat you like he's strong, but that really means he weak
Now your plotting for revenge, wanting to killem in his sleep
But shit we all humans, and ain't no body perfect
No I anit making excuse but that nigga just ain't worth it
This your last year of school, you're about to graduate
Lost some friends along the way, because their heart was full of hate
They mad cause you got that job, making more than what they make
Fuck them bitches, you don't need them any way
Family always wanting something, never call to tell you hey
Or to check up on your kids, or care to ask about your day
I just want you to know I notice...
You ain't alone, so anytime you want to talk don't hesitate just hit my phone


You threw on some yoga pants, that compliment your figure, just to run and grab some milk, you weren't worried about no nigga
But they always try and holler, but never step correct
Making comments bout your ass, showing blatin disrespect
But you always keep it real, and put them niggas back in check
They break their necks whenever they see ya, damn near causing wrecks
And that's when you're in you're scrubs, they ain't even seen you when you dressed
Got them kids wit no stretch marks, damn girl you blessed
Making moves on you own, you ain't worried you ain't stressed
Plus you never hit the club, cause you know it's full of mess
Trying to hold it in the road, and let GOD do the rest
Niggas throwing money at you, but you ain't even impressed
You clocking in clocking out, another day another dollar
You can't even pump your gas, without some niggas trying to holla
I just want you to know I noticed, you ain't alone
So any time you wanna talk don't hesitate just hit my phone
Ridin with that nine on me

Pulled you for speedin
Now its pistol in your face
Better start packin my nigga and play it safe
Poison  in the food but we eatin it anyway

Wanna shut me up but I got too much to say

Ridin with that nine on me
Cause all my niggas dying on me
Federalies spyin on me
You live by the gun
Nigga you die by the gun nigga
Better know this

I dont think imma die from spittin on a piece of ice
I dont think imma die because i got a bad heart
I dont think imma die because of lung cancer
I believe that I'm going to be able to die
For different things that i was born for
I believe that i will be able to die high off the people
Welcome to the mind of a Gemini
Where the duality is real
From moment to moment I can change how I feel
Come into my mind, come into my universe
Come into my soul

They say money change niggas, I don't know if that's true
I ain't got much but they think I do
Yeen my tribe I don't know about you
Mind of a Gemini no low IQ
They say money change niggas, I don't know if that's true
I ain't got much but they think I do
Yeen my tribe I don't know about you
Mind of a Gemini no low IQ
They say money change niggas, I don't know if that's true
I ain't got much but they thing I do
Yeen my tribe I don't know about you
Mind of a Gemini no low IQ
They say money change niggas, I don't know if that's true
I ain't got much but they thing I do
Yeen my tribe I don't know about you
Mind of a Gemini no low IQ

If a nigga owe me better pay up
Smooth operator with the lay up
Girl I ain't got time to lay up
T-shirt stained from the make-up
Liberate your mind if you really wanna wake up
5 times a day say a prayer
Nigga meditating like I'm in the Himalayas
Yeen got a plan then you planning to fail
Sending love to my brother doing time in the jail
Hard being black, white man give us hell
Hard getting rich when the hood still poor
Love turn into envy, friends turn into foes
Don't ask me why that's just how it go
Mind your business, keep your mouth closed
Been had keys unlock them doors
Game so cold talk a bitch up out her clothes
And my mind so high that it can't come down
If they didn't know then, well I bet they know now
Pull up a chair, everybody gather round
Mind of a Gemini set the world on fire
Hard being two people at the same damn time
Cracked that code and unlocked my mind
Gotta get on my grind, baby it's my time
Money can buy a lot of things but it can't buy time
I ain't feeling your vibe, yeen my tribe
I don't like rappers I done already tried
I ain't here to make friends, something I don't really hide
Reparations overdue, now I want my pie
Mind of a Gemini
I ain't feeling your vibe, yeen my tribe
I don't like rappers I done already tried
I be with the same old clique, same old bitch
Niggas getting knocked for the same old brick
I be riding strapped with the same four fifth
Niggas out here killing for the same old shit
Same old hood, same dope fiend
Same old feds do the same old sting
I be in the trap with the pounds of the green
Just another lost nigga with the same old dream

Buy you a celly, 
Who gon' take the charge now everybody fellas
Quarter brick of white nigga come and bust your melon
Flush the work down the toilet in the trap then we bailing
 on my ass I done missed another payment
People with the other side shooting where they hanging
Brother locked up, plug got hit
I been doing numbers with him and I pray he don't snitch
Same old drama, same baby mama
In my hood, shit you either sell dope or you robbing
Niggas pushed pats cause they sick and tired of starving
Bound by the bread they would serve they own mama
Same old school, same education
Same justice system fuck the judge cause he's racist
Jail was designed for our kind nigga face it
Got the game from my uncle he a third degree mason
EVT bitches quit the holiday , boosting  clothes out the mall she just want to feed the baby
Never had a job so they labelled me as lazy
But I made more today off a pack than what they paying
And it's tax free nigga fuck is y'all saying?
Pistol off safety if it's up then I'm spraying
Same old jay stealing food from the baby just to get another hit man that bullshit crazy


And a nigga's still lost you know what I'm saying, living in the dark looking for the light
It's time we get our guns, money, all for getting...

Brand new day, same old shit
Just another hood nigga trying to get rich
Everybody hurting so nigga jump in 
And the plug got bopped, ain't nobody got shit
It's a brand new day, same old shit
Just another hood nigga trying to get rich
Everybody hurting so nigga jump in 
And the plug got bopped, ain't nobody got shit

 told me nigga they gon' feel ya
Cuz you're living proof
Nigga you a rapper, not a killer
Boy, that's what we do
Pull up in them rimless
Fuck that talking bitch, we letting loose
He told me cous', if you don't make it out
Then what the fuck we do?
Nigga that's the word from my big cous'
I ain't having that
Building good relations with my maker
Keep my mind on track
I'm a convicted felon
I ain't showing no weapons
Nigga cause you don't see them
Don't mean they're none in my presence
Nigga stay Twitter-watching and talking
That don't impress me
Bitches nothing but killers and bosses all in my section
When I get it, I'm bringing that power back to my section
A million dollars we standing on towers up in my section
That's only love
That's for my thugs
That's what it is
That's in my blood
I promise I never change up
But my surrounding gotta change up

It's a brand new day, same old shit
Just another hood nigga trying to get rich
Everybody hurting so nigga jump in 
And the plug got bopped, ain't nobody got shit
It's a brand new day, same old shit
Just another hood nigga trying to get rich
Everybody hurting so nigga jump in 
And the plug got bopped, ain't nobody got shit
Gather round from the tallest to smallest
Murdered in the hood cause your mind stopped evolving

Gather round from the tallest to smallest
Tell stories bout how mankind fallen
Murdered in the hood cause your mind stopped evolving
Searching for answers, we dying too often

Nigga I was born alone Imma die alone
Riding in my uber strapped with these on
Finger on the trigger of the fucking chrome
Pussy nigga better leave me the fuck alone
I done made a lot of choices that was really bad
I done fucked up more money than ya ever had
Lost so many niggas thinking bout that make me sad
I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd be a dad
Hit the mall with my sons just to blow a bag
Swervin' in that 550 with the paper tags
It don't mean shit my nigga I don't ever brag
Half them hoes that they love I already had
He see my picture on her phone now her nigga mad
Come and try me bout a bitch I bet I beat ya ass
But I made my bed I gotta lay in it
God blessed me with this gift I can't play with it
All these crabs in the bucket wanna pull me down
Keep it real nigga that's why I don't come around
She ain't want me back then but she want me now
Cause she think I got them mills in my bank account
But I'm still on my grind baby I ain't rich
All you gold diggin' hoes out here ain't shit
NIggas didn't know me then say they know me now
To keep it real nigga that's why I don't come around

Murdered in the hood cause your mind stopped evolving
Gather round from the tallest to smallest
Murdered in the hood cause your mind stopped evolving
Chorus x 2
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g

Roll up blunts of that dro
Bullet proof under my clothes
Clutching my .45 close
Told mama that I love her, but we all gon' go
Walking with my head hung low
Wishing all my niggas wasn't dead no more
Reminiscing about days when we hustled for the dough
Drug money in my hands made my heart go cold
Always bending down, guess I ain't know
Never had shit, always wanted more
Nigga told me, can't take it when you go
Watch your enemies and you better keep them close
Going bout a hundred on a dead end road
'Til the pearly gates, seen God at the door
Fuckin' with the devil, I done sold my soul
Feeling bad cause I cheated on my girl wit' them hoes
Baby girl I love ya, don't want you to go
Doing what I can but a nigga still broke
Stay by my side, she ain't with me for the dough
Thinking about suicide with my brains on the floor
Never had a daddy, it was just big bro
If it's all over, I just want him to know
I ain't give up on rap, wouldn't stop 'til I blow
But the world about to end and it coming for my soul
And I don't wanna go
Chorus x 4
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g

Lord if you coming, give a nigga a sign
Lord, killer trying to ease my mind
Never went to church, occupied with crime
Stay down in the trap, busting down those dimes
Took my charge cause the pack was mine
Dropped in a cell, counting down the time
Dropped outta school, told mama all the time
I'mma go get saved but I'm always lying
Trying to live right in a world that's wrong
Just a nigga with a heart broke song
Can't get sleep, been up bout a week
Popped so many pills that my heart skipping beats
Waiting on the end, still selling my kit
Trying to stack money for a brand new benz
Looking for a lick cause a nigga need ends
Trying to find my dogs but they blowing in the wind
Caught up on the strip or they locked in the bid
So I'm praying, hoping that they get heard
Wishing they was free like some motherfucking birds
And I'm still in the hood where they killing over words
God looking down like "You niggas got nerve
Killing over money, hit the mall and splurge"
Worried bout the end, I can feel something
Seen them angels coming and the five all running
Chorus x 4
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g
Look, I ain't shit
I ain't never gonna be shit
And you less of a man than me
So as soon as I decide that you ain't gon' be shit (pow!)
So be it

They said I wouldn't be shit
Now I'm the shit, nigga check this out
Pull off with your bitch like skrrt
Then skeet off in that bitch mouth
What goes around comes around
Be cautious what you dish out
Used to have that work back in the day
But I'm legit now 

Pull off with another nigga women like it's nothin'
Fightin' with temptations nigga I am David Ruffin
Up it I'ma buss it you can trust that I ain't bluffin'
Firecracker temper, I be snappin' over nothin'
Make a call to boss, said he gone kill you 'cause he love me
Grew up rough and rugged, I am no stranger to rugby
Bitches used to diss me, now they tell me that they love me
I ain't let her fuck me, now she begging me to suck it
I'm two different people right now, I don't give a fuck
Don't really do convo, if we talkin' we gone fuck, so wassup
Handcuffing women never been my get down
Treated me like shit, but now they can't, 'cause I'm the shit now
Used to have that work back in the day 
Hate when the familiar faces act as if they know me
I don't fuck with new niggas, lil' homie I be lowkey

They said I wouldn't be shit
Now I'm the shit, nigga check this out
Pull off with your bitch like skrrt
Then skeet off in that bitch mouth
What goes around comes around
Be cautious what you dish out
Used to have that work back in the day
But I'm legit now 

I got, a brother in the grave, friends in the pen
Made more enemies than I made friends
My best friend turned into my kin
Time when they worried about when I'm in
I love god but I really love sin
Sin to the city, show titty and the kitty
Halfway genius but halfway crazy
Halfway sober, halfway wavy
Not that matched, my ex left my heart detached
Mother left at sixteen, uncle on crack
My life not intact, servin sack
With a fuck nigga that I used to live with
Come to find out he get beat by bitches, but let me end it
Rewind it to a time where I would find myself
Self employ, I signed myself
Mind of a Gemini rose so high
Aquarius vibe to the life I lie in
Got into a sight, it's, that these niggas ain't friends
Just associates, affiliate
Building a plan like Ferb and Phineas
Superficial, supernatural, prayed to God, that's my Allah
Only face the pain in time they told me that it's in Shalah
This the point at life you couldn't try me like no bitch now
Said I wasn't shit, now look at me girl I'm the shit now

They said I wouldn't be shit
Now I'm the shit, nigga check this out
Pull off with your bitch like skrrt
Then skeet off in that bitch mouth
What goes around comes around
Be cautious what you dish out
Used to have that work back in the day
But I'm legit now 
I wish that I could turn back the hands of time
Tomorrow only knows what the future holds
Thanksgiving with the fam in my grannies crib
I'm on the floor while my pop watch the Superbowl
And my auntie same
And my uncle's dad start crackin' jokes on my cousin for them tight ass pants
That was 1996 I'm in '95
Thinkin' bout them old days 'cuz I miss that shit
Now my fam fell apart now there's no more dinners
Used to be thick as thieves, now we thin as models
Trading rubbers in for guns
And then use 'em for bottles
'Cuz I got my own kids and I'm back in tradition
I ain't into holidays so it ain't no Christmas
Things ain't the same I done lost my spirit
Birthdays come around and I can't even feel it
Was it a dream or was it a lie?
Say a prayer bow my head and wait for God's reply...

Oh, my, god... I see you clearly now...
In my dreams you're here with me somehow...

And I wish I had wings swear to God I'd fly
Better talk to my aunt 'cuz shes always high
But who am I to judge 'cuz I used to smoke?
But she fightin breast cancer man it ain't no joke
And they killed Lil Reya, and he got them babies
Now their mommas all alone, who gone help them raise 'em?
Reminiscing 'bout them days when I played my Sega
Sonic The Hedgehog with the multiple players
And I had the fresh fade with the part in the middle
Rockin' LA Gears, couldn't afford them J's
Stealin' from Sou Lee who had the candy truck
But Sou left feet man they stank like fuck
Playin tag in the street outside the woods
Fist fightin' over bikes that we stole from the hood
Turn back the hands of time man I wish I could
Was it a dream or was it a lie?
Say a prayer bow my head and wait on God's reply...

Call, my, name... and I will make a sound..
I'm, in, love... with someone out of town...
Who is this shi-

They said I wouldn't be shit
Guess what? I made it
Daddy said he'd be back
Still feel like I'm waitin'
Momma beat us all the time she ain't got no patience
Just somethin' to think about before you hit your babies
And she prayed for better days and it drove her crazy
But I gotta give it to her tried her best to raise me
Spark it, hit her down. She was only a baby,                              who never had a childhood and I knowin' this crazy
I'ma buy you a resturant when I make my millions
Shed tears writin' this, and I know you can feel me
I ain't never tell momma I was touched by Phelix
And I ain't never gotta say it 'cuz I know I'm the realest
Had a fallin out with Sosa I just want him to listen
But come to think about it, really wasn't that serious
Dedicate this to Zenad, because I love her so dearly
Was it a dream or was it a lie?
Say a prayer bow my head and wait on God's reply...
With your feet in the air and your head in the ground
Try this trick, spinning
Yeah

Lost my mind at the voting poll
Police on my totem pole
Hoes is too and they know I'm broke
But my dick is dope and my flow is dope
Running game on her mental
Never fuck with her on her menstrual
Game sharp as a No.2 pencil
Drawing on fuck niggas, no stencil
Red beam on you, no pimple
Let me calm my nerves down
Codeine slowing my words down
I'm swerving on the curb now
Smoked away my memory
And all my evil tendencies
I ain't seen my mind in so damn long
Won't be me, I hope it remembers me

Where is my mind? X3

Lost my mind on a mission
Dope boy still in the kitchen
Or the trap with that Pyrex vision
Cooking dope trynna get me a Bentley, but
My grandma sick, need a kidney
One thing one my mind, gotta get it
Y'all niggas rap about it, I live it
Y'all niggas never seen it, I did it, ugh
Lost my mind, I'm the sickest
Nigga, I don't need no witness
Y'all bitch niggas be the ones that witness
On the stand pointing out who did it, ugh
I'm hollering "fuck your clique!"
I'll fuck your bitch when the case spit
With no kick, they holler "oh shit!"
My mind gone, but I'm focused


Lost my mind in a fucking Bible
Feeling like God when I hold my rifle
Killing off life cause they just recycle
Fuck you, who you? I ain't like you
Balled up fist, and I wanna fight you
Take my life, shit, I know you'd like to
My mind is a weapon and I just might shoot
...So y'all better duck down
Anybody seen my memory?
Laying next to John Kennedy
Or Kurt Cobain, what a goddamn shame
Sometimes I feel like ending me, but
Is it really worth it?
Shit, Cause I'm still searching
For my brain, or a better purpose
Cause right now I feel worthless, then
Karma brung pain, I deserved it
My inner thoughts got deserted
That lack of faith was my burden
It taught me to be more assertive
I got me a pack, start serving
Then got me a gun for the murder
211 them burglars
My evil thoughts go unheard of, ugh
Master mind of my craft, nigga
You think you get half nigga?
You must be high as fuck and out of your mind
I'mma just laugh, nigga
Ha
Yo, KOBK the murder gang
Shit
Free Tune, That's my bro
Yo, I'm the fucking coldest

In the hood trying to make it out
So what the fuck they mad about?
Rappers in my city don't want me to make a route
Jackers gon' jack so I'm prepared to take 'em out
Baby's on the way and I ain't got a dime
Just a choppa to my name and these books of rhymes
All alone in a room with this crooked mind
Watching rappers' videos knowing I can take their shine
Calm, tell me be patient, and take my time
I been struggling too long now I'm takin' mine
What good is being hot if nobody notice?
That in a room full of rappers I'm the fucking coldest

Only, tells me some things I don't wanna know
And I can't
Tells me some things I don't wanna know
(I'm the fucking coldest)
No I can't

Mind over matter but the matter is
The fact that we live with no time to give
Our fam, we throwing money at our kids
They be starving for knowledge and I can see their ribs
No ambition for college, they sitting at the crib
Selling drugs, probably be the next getting killed
On the block, there's 30 more just like 'em
I don't bond til those crackers come a reindict 'em
Chain smoking blunts, now they searching for a title
That you earned in the hood cause you shot a rifle
Guns make niggas feel tall like the Eiffel
Til somebody shoot 'em down and their body stiffle
Fuck a magazine, you need to read a Bible
Wicked preacher steal money for his own survival
Or maybe I'm just taking notice
That in a room full of rappers I'm the fucking coldest
Let it burn, (6x)
Let it burn, (6x)
Let it burn, (6x)

Light my blunt with a burning bill
They say I sold my soul. Well I guess it's real. Fuck a Bugatti
Need a hundred mill
And the way I feel, fuck how you feel
Burn my blunt with a burning bill
They say I sold my soul
Well I guess it's real
Fuck a Bugatti, need a hundred mill
And the way I feel, fuck how you feel

Lighting my blunts with a hundred nigga
You sold your soul for the money nigga
You was hungry nigga
They never want my nigga
I feel em' on me nigga
I feel em' hunt me nigga
I'm so lonely nigga with this chrome my nigga
Got the choppa And I'm finna act a donkey nigga
Get cold cased, whole clique get erased
When it come to the money
Boy I'm out for the case
So give me my slice before I take your half
100 mill, 50 mill, you do the math
On the road to riches but I had to take a cab
Trying to drink away the pain & forgot to pay the tab
And I'm getting pulled down and a bucket full of crabs
Niggas heard that I got sesame
Can't shit live if I don't let it breathe
Dumping shots out the forty in their neck till it bleed
Yeah!


Marksman and killers right next to me
Bow Down and pay some respect to me (this shits burning my lungs)
Rest in peace, in jeeps, you peace
(It's just the Ink)
Marksman and killers right next to me
Bow Down and pay some respect to me
(Evan pass me the light bruh)
Rest in peace, in jeeps, in peace

Marksman and killers right next to me
Bitch, Bow Down and pay some respect to me
No test in me. Bitches rest in peace
Pull up in jeeps. Boy I know where you be
You a money machine, you a ATM
In other words nigga, you a walking lick
Bitches on my dick
It's money over a bitch
Until the day that I'm rich
And nigga don't forget
If I ever go broke. I'm gone hit me a lick
Nigga take from the poor and they give to the rich
Man fuck that shit going out for this
When cop my gun I'll never bitch
Wreck my Bugatti left that bitch in a ditch
And I need a 100mil before they put me in a ditch
Now I'm riding around strap in my Honda looking sick
Smoking 100 bills
Ink burning my wrist
Symbolizing pain that a nigga went through
If I didn't rap to you, I'll be lying about this
Crispy 100 bills cutting my wrist
And the dirty money came off flipping them bricks
It's all blood money
Trace it back to my people
The almighty dollar makes us feel unequal
People killing people  I done seen so much evil
If you get caught slipping
You won't live to see the sequel
Go !

Let it burn, (6x)
Let it burn, (6x)
Let it burn, (6x)
And I'm breaking down bricks
Trying to build something
Fell out with the plug and he still front me
I got shooters riding with me, they gon kill something
Blow your head off if you steal from me
And I'm breaking down pounds trying to build something
Mail man late but he's still coming
I got shooters riding with me, they gon kill for me
Blow your head off if you steal something

Man that nigga riding with you, he ain't solid
Keep the 40 on me like a wallet
Had to leave the drop cos I know the feds watching
Pitch a nigga work like a quarterback option
Came from the gutter, going back is not an option
I'll be god damned if I let a nigga stop me
Bad bitch with me eating sushi drinking saki
Get her to the crib she gon suck me all sloppy
Niggas catching a case disturbing everybody
I got shooters on go they ready to catch a body
Jays in the kitchen, I'm cooking up like hibachi
Trapping in my forces, nigga I don't wear designer
Cameras all around us cos I don't trust a soul
How the fuck you solid nigga when you done told
Nine times out of ten it's on somebody you know
Game done changed, niggas breaking the code


I buy a pound, break it down, I'm trying to build something
Lay it down, play around, I'm gon kill something
I done run up from the plug and he steal from me
Had to share some love, split the drugs with my lil brother
Aye I'm a wolf but I dress up like a sheep
On a mission, I ain't slept in about a week
If you want a million dollars you can't stress about a freak
Pray to god to protect me from the devil in my sleep
Amen
My momma told me that I need to get some rest
I told her ain't no time for sleeping, I'm the best
Everybody watching, trying to peep what's coming next
Pussy niggas plotting, I'm gonna leave that pussy wet
Aye fuck a rat, run and tell that
And you can tell that pussy nigga that I said that
You folded cos you weak, nigga you can't take it back
I wrote this song for street niggas, go play it back
There’s a whole lotta hoes, and a whole lotta niggas
Clint Eastwood with the fight is gorilla
Turn the warfare to a cold-blooded killer
Take a load off my mind with the paraphernalia
You not familiar, might end up dismembered
My heart equals the 31st of December
Got an ice box where my heart used to be
Whats so bad about ya, really never was for ya
In the first place, you got me in the worst place
Wanna get you at a slow pace, he turned into a coke case
Toe-ticking with no fix, procaine
Clutching the stick at the niggas who balding
November, out of lease, having you falling
Death that you caused is outta here
Outta this atmosphere, the captains here
Twenty-three to your front like a Cavalier
Mixed with Jim Carry, got a mask the tears
Like Paul Revere, gotta warn you all
? sweet like alcohol
Mushrooms is my adderall
Rest in piece to all locked dogs
Lido?, TT?, and China man, wait hold up
These niggas dont understand, how we do
(How we do it on the other side playboy)
Yall niggas dont understand how we do
(How we how we do it on the otherside playboy)
But you do when the gun is aimed at you
(How we how we do it on the otherside playboy)
Yall niggas dont understand how we do
(What can I do)
Nothing so blue as a heart in pain
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain
COD 2, man
Realest shit I ever wrote, nigga
Free Tune
 cult

And I got so much pain in my soul
I'm drowning all my problems with this liquor, the devil keep coming back to me
I can't tell them no
My friends turn foe, got to watch these niggas cause they hoes
Nights mama cried
All of them shoots outside, with them niggas got kid, I could've died
But he can't be alive
And I still wonder why, staring down the barrel of my 45

What's life to a nigga that don't want to live?
What's to be in need to a nigga that be breaking into cribs?
Ever been so fucking hungry, you can see your ribs?
Hit a lick for your nigga, to help him pay his bills
Nah, I don't think you've ever been through it
Wanted to kill him but you couldn't cause you were kin to him
Wouldn't kill if somebody put an end to him
Beat him down, do him like grown men do him
Nigga, I'm just spitting facts
Fucking 'round these bitches, hoping they don't get a tax
Born with a heart, but I had to give it back
Ain't no love on these streets, learned that selling crack, nigga
Cause my mama was a thief
And my daddy was the king
Using bitches and putting them on his team
He never had much, but managed to stay clean
Guess that's why I love shoes and designer denim jeans
I'm a fucking monster, something to deal with
But a problem nonetheless
I'm spitting that real shit
Nigga we the generation that's taking over the world
Got no love for these bitches
Gave it all to my girl
Let the world drink a liquor, taking shots 'till I hurl
And you know I'm hollin' "Free Tune!"
They gave my brother a bond, you know we gotta get them
I'm actively seeking paper, so dope become a victim
I told Jill stay in school
Idol time is the devil, my nigga, don't be a fool
Guess that's why I'm serving packs and riding 'round with my 2

And I got so much pain in my soul
I'm drowning all my problems with this liquor, the devil keep coming back to me
I can't tell them no
My friends turn foe, got to watch these niggas cause they hoes
Nights mama cried
All them shootouts outside, when them niggas got killed, I could’ve died
But he kept me alive
And I still wonder why, staring down the barrel of my 45

What's pain to a nigga that be numb to it?
What's a pack to a trapper that just run through it?
My nigga, ain't nothing to it
I grew up without my daddy, I can't put my sons through it
But my problems still pouring in
Fucking different bitches in every city I'm touring in
I thought I never had fans
Cause I come from the city with choppers like Iran
I remembered being bullied bullied by Jordan and I ran
To my big bro Rio, made me fight him like a man
I was scared but I really had them hands
Jumped out the porch on Citrus, sold grams
Made my first forty, ain't look back since
I was in it head first, nigga couldn't tell me shit
Dropped out of school to chase dead presidents
Public housing, fist fighting, smoking blunts till I'm bent
And that was back when Dominique had that neon
And Brian creak apartments while my brother shotted Kian
Heard them gunshots, tires screeching up the block
Ambulance and the police, the violence never stop nigga
So what's problems to a nigga that be having problems?
And what's beef to a nigga that live with his chopper?
All alone, he never had no fucking mama
So all he know is pain, murder, and the fucking drama
I'm always getting home when the sun up
I be at the spot where it's going down
From the East coast to California
I be with them niggas they say run your town

Look who made it out the gutter still stacking and living
Niggas hungry so they looking for a lick with they biscuit
In the park with my sons feeding ducks and fishes
Stay down through my struggle cause I came on a mission
With a pad and a pen takin' notes while I listen
Politicin' bout some business cause I'm fresh out of prison
Niggas who can't mind they business wind up floating with fishes
Up in Vegas with my niggas playing poker with wifey
Top floor Trump tower give a fuck if you like it
Turning up on all my haters now I feel like mighty chee
Ego still intact baby please don't lie to me
And I don't wanna hear it you can say your apology
She poured a cup of tea and came and laid on the side of me
Soul levitated, felt things inside of me
Front row seat to the game inside of me
All of my niggas tribe ain't no lames on side of me


Went from runnin' from the cops now I'm runnin' a business
Taking laps in my pool with some beautiful women
Placing bets on myself cause I know Imma win it
Hit the mall with my son just to fuck up some digits
No regard for the money cause I get it with interest
Never in the booty club trickin' bread on the pigeons
Got the feds on my trail and it's getting relentless
Watching everything I see I liberated my vision
Barely schools in my city nigga that's how we living
Up in Harlem with the nation kicking knowledge on Lenox
Teaching brothers how to love with no type of condition
Never trust the government or crooked ass politicians
Looking back on where I came from, mama I did it
Switching lanes me and Joe up in that S550
Politicin' with them niggas they say runnin' the city
My bank account looking so juicy now I'm feeling like Biggie
Cause I'm on
My nigga, I don't do push-ups, just pick-ups and drop-offs
With a bad bitch, getting topped off, you try me and get knocked off
For a whole brick of that white soft, get outlined in that white chalk
Two bowls of loud for the Randy Moss, my niggas shoot, they don't never talk
Jays run up to the car when I pull up, nigga
??? I cook up, nigga
Fuck naw, ain't no hook up, nigga
AK got your block shook up, nigga
Yo' bitch on my meat, she gave me her door key
Only known me for one week, now that's where my work be

Full of bad bitches, y'all niggas and G's
My enemies be on my dick, they look like groupies to me
My bad, that's your girlfriend, then why she leaving with me?
We ain't dated a week but still she gave me a key

I seen your homeboy picture, man, a gram of the three
I told him count them bands up, I gotta sell me a key
And even though you see me MTV Jam of the Week
I got the stupid and rich game a nigga ever done seen
I got the kangaroo money, bout to jump off my jeans
I call a hundred thousand dollars, I was just in my timbs
NBA money, nigga, this just one of my rings
You say your nigga gettin' money, that ain't no money to me


Hopped up out the coffin, gold fangs like I'm Blackula
Poked my bitch in the back and told her work the spatula
Then I took a piss, I have farted, I have flatulence
I be fucking all these hoes, I don't practice abstinence
Ask your friend, I'm masculine, the boppers keep on hasslin'
I'm Mexican on mescaline, stressin' him, crescent kid
Pedestrians be steppin' in cause I don't look that threatenin'
Baby-faced assassin, I throw tantrums, I be flashin'
I get high 'fore I get dressed, does that mean that I'm high fashion?
Self-esteem high, I be high when I be braggin'
Breathin' like a dragon, beat him, leave him where he standin'
Sniff that white, Susan Sarandon or that young Dakota Fanning


I been guappin' off this coca so I'm choppin' up this yola
If somebody try to take it then it's "Dame me pistola"
I'm a rocker and a roller, there'll be problems when we show up
We don't talk much we just blow up (we don't talk much we just blow up)
Everybody 'round here know us for the way we keep it P
Me and Nacho P be flavin', extra wavy in the sea
Your homegirls won't give it up cause they gon' save that shit for me
To sum it up your motherfuckers is as basic as can be
I don't care she with you tonight, the next day she'll be with me
And you really should be payin' me, this game here isn't free
You gon' say that shit to her, why don't you say that shit to me
Just know I got them good hands from all this playing this key, boy
Riding with my thug
Everything love, everything love, everything love
Married to the plug
Everything love, everything love, everything love
Money just because
Everything love, everything love, everything love
Gotta thank the man above, cause
Everything love, everything love, everything love

Bimbo you too simple to get down with this here
Forrest Gump shit, run my town up in here
Be cool, cause we'll tear it down up in here
Ye' ain't tribe nigga you can't come around up in here
I'm a fool, I ain't fucking round up in here
Too precise for defeat nigga, check my technique
On the street, I'm known as that nigga with the verses
My old lady even tribe, she don't wear designer purses
What you thought, a nigga was a motherfucking dummy
Rock destroyed Chucks and I act kind of slummy
Blowing all the cheddar I ain't saving up the money
On the cash like a bumblebee fly to the honey
Get a clue, my nigga you don't even know the half
She was 'posed to be my equal but ain't even know the math
Get the picture, or nigga do you need a bigger graph
Stole the concept, running through these tracks like a contest

Riding with my thug
Everything love, everything love, everything love
Married to the plug
Everything love, everything love, everything love
Money just because
Everything love, everything love, everything love
Gotta thank the man above, cause
Everything love, everything love, everything love

What happened, huh? Don't nobody know nothing?
C'mon now everybody speak at once
You mean to tell me out of all ya'll motherfuckers in here don't nobody know jack shit? Don't nobody know nothing?
What up with this? Somebody gotta know something going on
See what I'm saying?
You fucked up big time. You're incapable of running this shit. If you was taken care of business...
If I was what? If I was what? Say it again, what you say?
That's what I thought you said, cause that's what I got right now- nothing!

Niggas be all in your face but they want your spot
I'm eating lobster, meditating on the yacht
Ain't the type to rap about some shit that I ain't got
Niggas always gassing rappers, acting like they hot
But let the truth be told, you really not
What you think you is but that ain't my biz
Niggas get offended then they get in they feelings
If you ain't my tribe we can't have no dealings
Building and destroying, tell me what you building
Niggas is bitches, they killing over women
Let me stop the track, so i can wipe my tears
Tears that I shed for the ones no longer here
Like Corey, Avery, Donkey, Rel, and Wheel
Now I understand why Lil Shaq be popping pills
Industry is fake but my life so real
All my niggas getting killed that's why I'm riding with my steel
I don't do favors for niggas
I fucked den you payed her, my nigga
That shit ain't player, my nigga
My neighbor the mayor, my nigga
That mean that my paper legit
That mean that my business in order
You pay her, I pay her no mind
I can't be wasting my time
Cuz I got mountains to climb
Places to go
And women to fuck
They running from us while we running it up
Got all the game and I'm soaking it up
Fuckin it up boy I'm fucking it up
None of you niggas is hotter than us
Try to play tough and I'm busting you up
Locking us up with no key to the cuff
Now the media eatin it up
Tried to erase us by giving us cases
Threw us in court with no representation
Boy I'm a soldier
My solider mentality
Be the reason why these people is after me
Bounty on me they never gonna capture me
Catch 'em slippin' they gon' wind up a casualty
Round table, breaking bread with the faculty
Ballin' like athletes
Niggas be hella jealous
Writin statements they be tellin tellin
Most of my niggas convicted felons
Still ridin' around with they weapon
Fuck a draco got a sig on me
And your bitch face
Got my kids on it

Fuck all these politicans
That be politicking
Man, I stuck my dick in while the clock was ticking
Buzzer-beater
Motherfuckers always hated to see her
I was the one
With the power to kill
But the power and will
That I had was a lot for a brother to take
Motherfuckers taking L's to the face
I ain't got time to get high
I can barely get by motherfucker
What the fuck you thinkin'
I'm drinking, I'm drinking a lot of the water
My future daughter won't be stressing 'bout shit
Wrapping it up
Then i dive in a bitch
I'm divine in this bitch
Still ain't got time in this bitch
Still looking fly in this bitch
Don't you lie in this bitch
I be the type that get live in this bitch
And Then die for a bitch
Motherfuckers got me fucked up
Thinking I won't pop the trunk up
I ain't never been a bitch, boy
Compromising for a bitch, boy
I got my shit together
In this gloomy weather
Motherfuckers tether they emotion better
Grab umbrella
Together we stand or
Divided we fall
Fuck it I ball
Shout out my brother Damarious
I felt like leaving the O was preposterous
I was just moping around 'til I picked up the pen
And I practiced my penmanship
Now I be penning shit
And I be killing shit
Fuck negativity
I practice diligence
I want a million
For all my children
I don't want nothing to do with you period
End of discussion

Fuck all that talking, my nig

I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care
I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga, without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care

They hollerin' get my bread up, I own the bread truck
Acting like they got it and they got me fed up
Every day a different bitch another set of problems
Plug showed love, niggas hated and they robbed him
So I'm riding solo with this .38 revolver
Never been the friendly type, ain't got a lot of friends
Death around the corner so I bulletproof the Benz
Careful who I'm letting out and cautious who I'm letting in
Hard trusting humans, did dirty by my kin
Smiling in my face but really don't want me to win
Been dealing with that type of shit guess it'll never end
Niggas start developing envy now the bullshit begins
Who are you to tell me different bout this life I live
I don't trust a soul, that's why its cameras in my crib
Lady did me dirty she was 'posed to be my rib
Can't have no expectations, guess it is what it is
Know to be destructive, lately I've been trying to build
Like working on my G.E.D and I just bought a crib
Sick of playing catch-up I done lost too many years
Done with all the running now I'm facing all my fears

I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care
I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga, without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care

They ask me what the business, they knowing the signs
Police planting drugs on me but they know they ain't mine
Thinking death around the corner so I roll with my nine
Mama praying all the time, she just hope that I'm fine
Bout to lose my fucking mind, ain't no trusting my kind
Overtime on my grind, got no time to unwind
Everything I got is mine, I just took me a trip
And they killed my niggas Flip for a brick of that whip
I ain't even get the work and thats what's fucking me up
Roll them dices long enough and you gon' run out of luck
Son mama trippin' on me, I ain't made it with rap
I'm just trying to stay focused, can't go back to the trap
Family tell me all the time keep my faith in the Lord
I been praying night and day but now I'm feeling ignored
Pussy niggas packing pistols but they never gon' use 'em
But still gon' get they head bust, that's just how real niggas do them

I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care
I see death around the corner I don't go there
I see envy in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga, without that pistol can't go nowhere
Still get your head bust cause niggas don't care
I'm getting richer, I'm getting richer
Fuck what you say... I'm getting richer

Standing on the block all day with my Glock out
Life ain't shit to a young black dropout
Motherfuck a job, that ain't nothing but a cop out
Capsizing work but I used to play the watch out
Teacher couldn't teach me and the preacher couldn't reach me
My momma can't control me got too old for her to beat me
Lights was never on, had roaches up in my house
Still selling dope even though we know the cops out
Smoking in the hallway never skip class
I ain't even bother to go the teacher can kiss my ass
Always had ambition to be the richest in class
Me and my nigga gon' get with the pistol or a bass

Hard in the game
Had to do some things, had to do some things
Fuck what you say, had to do some things
I'm getting richer, I'm getting richer
Fuck what you say...

Then the work start booming, time start flying
Peers graduating but my niggas still dying
Rolling up a blunt told myself I'd be fine
Boy I swear my life a movie that I wish I could rewind
Niggas writing statements that ain't build to do the time
But you should've thought about that shit before you did the crime
Rap sheet long but I still tote my nine
Cause I'm caught up in the game I done made up my mind
Told momma not to worry, cause she stays stressing
God got my back and if he don't I got my weapon
Counting up my paper while I'm counting up my blessings
Doing what I got to do I take the heat of all my lessons
Gotta get rich that's my first and only goal
Standing in the kitchen with the baking soda in a bowl
Chevy on 24's with a mouth full of gold
Dope dealer in his prime with the biggest bankroll

Hard in the game
Had to do some things, had to do some things
Fuck what you say, I had to do some things
I'm getting richer, I'm getting richer
Fuck what you say...
Yeah, KOBK, new generation, we got next, yeah

I'm just ridin' round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done sold so much dope in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin' round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done fucked so many bitches in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon

When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done did so much shit in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection and I'm just

Still, I remain the same
Stay in the game, create a new lane
And the niggas around me feelin the same
I remember bitchin when a nigga ain't even have a dollar to his name
Niggas don't wanna believe that KBG runnin the gang
From the crown to my head to my feet I plead the blood of Jesus
Yeah, that's over me and my people
Uh, hearing and seeing no evil, loaded this ? and choppa and bust in that bitch like it's legal

I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done sold so much dope in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done fucked so many bitches in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done seen so much shit in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done did so much shit in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection and I'm just

Charlotte on my back, it is on my heels
Runnin from my past, grippin on my steel
Tryin to make it rap, it ain't payin no bills
Just give a nigga 30, and a tour with no appeal
So I'm prayin on my knee, shit real
Flippin packs knowing you won't make no meal
Niggas still hustle cuz they don't know nothing different
Now they runnin to them graves or they gettin locked in prison
They got me wanting better, nigga imma do better
This shit hard when you out here with no cheddar
Still tryna hustle but I'm seein I'm no clever
Beefin with them pussy niggas so I'm strapped with my Beretta

I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done sold so much dope in the hood
When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it

When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection
And I'm just ridin round with my weapon

And I'm just ridin round with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it

When I look in the mirror I ain't got no reflection and I'm just
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll flip them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em
I said, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll split them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em

Nigga, it's a war going on outside
You don't got an army better join one
Got peers that'll kill and I'm on one
Swear to God, Uncle Sam don't want none
Put it on my hood, you fuckin' with the wrong one
Got a real short temper but a long gun
Nigga fuck a white flag that don't mean nothing
Got some cold blood killer like mean Russians
Chevy full a niggas on a scene bussin'
Police ask questions, we ain't seen nothing
Got a bullet for a snitch if he seen something
Homicide or murder nigga same difference
Catch him up in traffic while he lane switchin'
Chopper go to choppin', leave his frame twisted
Got a hundred fifty rounds and I ain't missing
Got a hundred fifty rounds and I ain’t missing
Nigga, it's a war going on outside
You ain’t a gun better get one
Niggas doing B&E's trying to steal one
Better keep your eyes open, nigga stay on it
GPS a nigga crib, we gon' to lay on it
Catch him out at public doing something dirty
Riding strapped with the .9 or the baby .40
Gotta beam on that bitch so you can't ignore it
Nigga, it’s a war going outside with the police and the government
But we all killing off each other and they loving it
Shit, it's kill or be killed, what am I to do?
Got me thinking ain't no future left for the youth
Young niggas don’t fight, all they do is shoot
Got me thinking ain't no future left for the youth
Young niggas don't fight, all they do is shoot (my nigga)

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll flip them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em
I said, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll split them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em

Nigga, it’s a war going outside
You ain't got a vest better get one
Like germs in the air when that MAC sprayed
Bullets hit ya body, bitch you better act dead
Arms, chest, head, face, back, then his legs
Put the whole clip in him, gon' fill him up
Niggas acting like they real, they ain't real as us
Gunning down the police, we don't give a fuck
Shit, it's kill or be killed and they killing us
If you can't trust a government, who can we trust?
Fist-fighting in my hood made a nigga tough
Ain't no safety on the Glock, nigga gon' bust
Hundred rounds in the 'K, I ain't gotta aim
Get me close to the nigga, let me do my thang
Better have an umbrella when them bullet rain
Killed a nigga home, and now you gotta feel his pain
Nigga, it’s a war going on outside
Over territory on my side of town
You ain't from 'round here don't come around
If you ain't got permission, they gon' lay you down
Woke up and went to sleep to that chopper sound
Nigga we don't fuck around with the fuck around
Fuck around and we'll have ya ass ducking rounds
Got the dope money buried underneath the ground
Nigga, it’s a war going outside
You ain't got a lawyer better get one
Judge giving niggas life for a couple birds
While police killing niggas like we ain't shit
Middle finger to the law, they can suck a dick
Judge giving niggas life for a couple bricks
While police killing niggas like we ain't shit
Middle finger to the law, they can suck a dick (my nigga)

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll flip them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em
I said, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', I'll split them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck who with 'em
Lately I've been praying for a blessing
Money problems got a nigga stressing
Paranoid so I'm riding with a weapon
Trying to overcome it everybody wanna test me
Told Mama I ain't going back to County
Gotta keep them fuck niggas from around me
Meditating everyday got me grinding
Made it out the hood everybody look astounded
My teacher said I'd be dead or imprisoned
Can't nobody stop me my nigga I'm on a mission
Working overtime bitch you know I'm committed
Looking back on life it was hard but I did it
Working at the mall selling shoes for commission
Now we are at the mall, whole Hood getting tinies
I always gave back I never been stingy
You ain't take care of your people now they heart full of Envy
Started at the bottom with a dollar and a dream
Waking up for school in the Trap with the fiends
I was selling dope at the age of fifteen
Just to have some extra money but it wasn't what it seemed
Lost a lot of niggas they was hating on the team
Niggas dead and gone know exactly what I mean
We was trying to ball like Jordan and Kareem
On that Wu-Tang shit we was all about the cream
Just some niggas with a dream ( just some niggas with a dream x3)
How the fuck you real when you testified
Judge talking time you was terrified
Can't look me in my eyes coz you petrified
Pull up in the hood now they mesmerised
Nigga saying that they real but they telling lies
Swear to god my Revolution will be televised
I can't work no nine-to-five I'm My Own Boss
Ain't no frontin' me I'll take my own loss
Hit a nigga with the work and he run off
When you doing something good niggas gon talk
Screaming free my brother tune and he gon walk
Left the hood niggas saying that Im goin' soft
They opinion never mattered I just let them talk
When you doing good niggas wanna knock you off
Park that S550 on the sidewalk
Distribute the work grab the cake and then I drive off
They runnin' up boy you know a nigga trigger happy
Paranoid schizophrenic get it from my daddy
I don't trust shit but these slugs and this ratchet
Imma tell you this, the money ain't gon make you happy
Cause i started at the bottom with a dollar and a dream
Waking up for school in the Trap with the fiends
I was selling dope at the age 15 just to have some extra money but it Wasn't what it seemed
Just a nigga with a dream x3
I use to pull kick Doe's
Run up in a nigga spot asking what it hit foe
Took a nigga roly now my mo' fucking wrist froze
Plug had them thangs coming in from San Francisco
Fed's got the phones tap can't give you no info
Now I'm laying low like a nigga doing limbo
Pull up to the trap let the jays wash the benzo
Swerve up beside the police roll down my window
Let em see the grill I got no love for the pigs tho
Every time I turn around niggas getting killed tho
Now that I'm on everybody want to come for me
Now a days I feel like loyalty a luxury
So I cautious of the people in my company
And got my eyes on the ones who say they fuck wit me
Momma told me it would be
Days like this dreamed about it
Never thought that we'd get paid like this
 X2 - Cause I dun stayed down now I finally came up
Niggas coming round acting like they made us
Used to do It free but now they gotta pay up
Just some niggas from the ghetto that got rich and famous

Used to pull kick Doe's
Run in up in a niggas spot
Asking what it hit for
Run up on the plug spent the drugs
For my kinfolk
Pull up in the driveway
You can smell the Indo
Trappin by my lonely
What the fuck I need a friend for?
Niggas say they real
But they really be pretend tho
Never catch me slippin
All my pistols got extendos
Makin fast money
So you know thas how I spend tho
Pockets on chubby
Swervin hard with lil ?Tenslo?
With some bad bitches
Eating sushi up  in Inzo
(yo yo)
And I'm prayin ??? I'd make it up out the streets
Fully loaded 45 for my enemies
Niggas hate me for no reason
Why the envy me?
Held tomb in the cell?
A G underneath
Momma told me it'd be days like this
Dreamed about it
Never thought that we'd get paid like this
 X2 - Cause I dun stayed down now I finally came up
Niggas coming round acting like they made us
Used to do It free but now they gotta pay up
Just some niggas from the ghetto that got rich and famous
(This is genius...)

All eyes on me, nigga, shit, I'm feelin' like pot...
They can't even picture me rollin' though, ha...

(Can you)
Picture me rollin'?
Ridin' and I'm smokin'
(In the) S550 and that bitch prolly stole it, nah nah
You know I'm rollin', .45-totin'
All this cash that I'm foldin'
Niggas hate to see me rollin'


Can you picture me rollin'?
Ridin' and I'm smokin'
Pistol on my lap, bust a nigga head open
I'm precise with the aim, you don't wanna provoke me
All this kush in my lungs is the reason that I'm chokin'
In this work I be servin', this niggas is so potent
Heard the jackboys lurkin', try to rob me I'm-a murk 'em
With the .40 I'm a surgeon, licking shots and then I'm swervin'
Throwin' work to all my niggas, they catch it like Michael Irvin
And them killers gon' blitz; nigga, I ain't never worried
I'm thuggin' it 'til I'm buried, that extendo hold 30
Told mama that I got her, she ain't gotta worry
Smoke foggin' up my whip, now my vision gettin' blurry
I'm just trying to make it home, cause the police out here lurkin'
Ask me how I bought my whip, bitch you know that I ain't workin'
You can't even search my shit, you ain't even got a warrant
No pussy motherfucker just don't wanna see me swervin', nah nah...


If you my nigga, I really mean my nigga
Vow to stay the same even if we gettin' bigger
The money comin' in like we got a money printer
And we runnin' through them checks like a motherfuckin' sprinter
I don't fuck with pussy niggas, stay away from pretenders
Cause niggas be in yo business, wearin' wires with antennas
It won't hold up in court, like pants with no suspenders
Money don't grow on trees -- then why the fuck I got these splinters?
And I'm ridin' by my lonely, tryin' to remember --
The days, when my heart wasn't cold like December
Stolen car; stolen rims, it don't even match the vendor
Whippin' dope up with the drill, fans sittin' by the window
And the family fuck you over, guess blood gettin' thinner
In a world full of losers niggas hate when you a winner
So I'm ridin' and I'm smokin', pistol in my lap
Just left my stash house; now I'm ridin' to the trap, nah nah...


Shady Blaze, bruh, and you know that I'm a schizo
I'm ridin' and I'm smokin', you already know how the shit go
If you niggas wanna beef, we can make that shit official
It'll be a two-on-one, you versus me with a pistol
Yes nigga I am loaded, so don't do nothin' stupid
Piss me off, you get the heat; who's the next to make me do it?
Wise up in these streets, I ain't hangin' with nothin' stupid
I ride around with my family, bitch niggas are not included
Deniro, he got the .40, so don't make my nigga use it
Destination is the money, no way we ain't gettin' to it
I'm-a be this way forever and what you hear is exclusive
Ya bitin' my style; fuck around, nigga, and get a tooth chipped
It's real life, king shit, I'm a fuckin' Raider
If they call this shit the rap game then I'm the top player
Niggas start off with they mamas, now they snitchin' to they neighbors
Then they talkin' to the pigs, next up's gon' be them mayors
Ain't nothin' more worse than a motherfuckin' snitch
Kill him and then take his bitch
Tie her up and don't take her list (?)
Dress the ho up in the rain (?)
Then drop her off with the Crips
I'm a shady nigga; it's Greenova, how you picture me now?


Picture me, picture a nigga rollin'... (x3)
Nigga rollin', Greenova...
See ya later, what she told me
And she hopped out my car
I'm a nigga in my eyes
But to her I'm a star
See I ain't that type of nigga to go hang at a bar
I hit the hood to buy a sack just twist up a 'gar
Fallin' victim to desires, that ain't taking me far
What's the point of being known
If you don't know who you are?
Shit, I'm just a ghetto baby that's in search of some love
Only time I hit up on her, is when I want her to fuck
See that pain in her eyes,I be making it rough
She camplain about her job cause she ain't making enough
Got a baby at the crib, that she don't even own
They gentrifying the ghetto, now she losing her home
I'm a part of the problem, shit I know that I'm wrong
Got my lady at the crib and she love me to death
I'd took that all for granted, now there ain't none left
Say I'm gonna make a change, but to my word she deaf
Damn

The most disrespected woman in America, is the black woman
The most un-protected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America, is the black woman. The honorable Elijah Muhammed teaches us to respect, our women, and to protect our women
We will kill you, for our women

Raised in the hood, but that ain't your fault
Niggas do the same thing, expecting different results
Definition of insanity, better hope you don't die
What's the point of having knowledge if it never applies?
Momma stressin' 'bout them bills, sick of watching her cry
I was born with the guilt, shit I know I'm a leader
What's the point of having power if you're hurting your people?
Definition of a nigga, if you're good or you're evil
On my seventh lifetime, and I'm fully conscious
Fuck religion cause I feel it apply to conquer
Got corrupted by the street, turned into a monster
Can't sleep, when you feel that holy spirit haunt you
What's the point of having love, if you don't love yourself?
Kept my distance from my feelings, they no longer there
Praying for my innocence, cause now I wantin' them back
But once they're gone, shit they're gone
I'm just telling you that, damn

Who taught you to hate yourself
From the top of your head to the soles of your feet?
Who taught you to hate your own kind?
Who taught you to hate the race that you belong to
So much so that you don't want to be around each other?
43 hours in, I'm on a money binge
Wanna know where I been? I'm where the money is
Now count it out, thousand dollar piles


See oftentimes I get lost in time
360 cents in every hour
So that means every second cost a dime
So imagine what I'm spending in a fiscal year
When bills start to pile up
And days start to disappear
So fuck a watch, I watch the sky
If the house at noon, made it back 'round sunrise
But you can't always follow the stars
So I walk by faith and try to follow my heart
My hometown on now, put it down for my home state
Young Superman still fly with no cape
And I was training in the rain all by my lonely
Now I'm winning; motherfuckers want to help me hold the trophy
So they ask why I rap about overseas
I tell them most of my Gs got cases so they can't leave
The state, or they never left the 'Ville
So I hit 'em up on Skype, show them the view from my hotel


(Shady Blaze, I see you
ST, what's happening, bruh?)
Out the concrete a rose grow
I'm from the block where they pill pop and guns blow
Them peewees strapped, where the fuck they finna run for?
Police patrol, we still manage to get the dope sold
That's how it go
I never been a stranger to the trap
I'm countin' up this dirty money scattered 'cross my lap
Hand on my strap, paranoid cause I'm serving smokers
Gotta watch my enemies and try to keep my friends closer
You can't tell who is who, I swear this world full of vultures
Can't trust a motherfucking soul, what the game showed us
Maneuver smooth cause them pigs tryin' to meet their quota
You get a extra five years, you lockin' with that soda
In Austin, Texas, conversatin' with my nigga Clova
He told me, "'Niro, keep on grindin' 'til you get exposure"
Christmas and Bentley with me, tryin' to get some bitches over
And Shady Blaze, my fuckin' dog, we gettin' closer
To flying private jets with ST, I'm gettin' chauffeur
But in reality I'm just a rapper trying to make it
Out my current situation with my lack of patience
Slowly embracing this rap shit as my occupation
Need a Bugatti, I'm on Twitter, DMing with Satan
Murder on my mind, I stop by the police station
Blew the cop head off that kill my nigga Aaron
I call that reparation
Bustin' like I'm crazy, pistol off safety
God, save me

I'm in the studio every day hoping for better days but I keep getting the worst, yeah
People singin' and tellin' at me but for some reason when I'm in the streets I feel cursed, yeah
I'm all on the gas and I'm tryin' to go fast but it still feels like I'm in reverse, yeah
I just wanna pile up all the money as much as I can 'til I'm up in a hearse, yeah
I got firearms gettin' held back
But the handless pain, I never felt that
Man, I go through the middle just like a tailback
And you ain't gettin' the money, I cannot help that
Nigga one time, bitch niggas want mine
But I eat like it's lunch time
Three niggas come by ridin', it's crunch time
And I threw it all, wrong man for the punchline, okay?
Let's get it, I'm ridin' here
Everybody in the area, I'm gonna have everybody in fear
All you wack male niggas, y'all about to be clear?
Get them motherfuckers droppin' 'til they box on the ear
Shady Blaze and his brethren and I got that drum
She gonna cut with your money, better stop that ho
Nigga one beat, better pop-pop and go
I'm on fire here, nigga, stop drop and roll
My homie sellin' our powder, I'm feelin' like power
The money is ours for 43 hours
(?)
It's time to devour the niggas who nah'd us, we doin' it
I just thought we'd go in it so don't be offended
Get money then spend it, we livin' resplendent
Don't tell my life business, yo, love to my niggas
And fuck all the women we movin', shit...
They been playin' a different game these days man
It's the long game, pay attention
When they come for you
They won't have their guns
Confidently etched out from the cold of their holsters
They know now that this world is photoshop ready
To digitally document their death squad tactics
That their antics
Are now archived, videoclipped, and facebook status
Set to go viral even though our protests and proof are never enough fire
To burn their house to ashes
Our death, our death sometimes pins medals on their chests
And allows them to retire with sizable paycheck
But nonetheless, we fight back, the best we can
So understand now, that when they come for you
They startin' at the foundation, at your doorstep
They will be dressed as developer or realtor or hipster
Your best 90's hip hop playing
From their boombox on your block
Dressed in your latest fashion
Appropriately, appropriating your culture till they fit in
Till they move in
But then the police traffic rises
And the crime seems to drop
Property tax rises around big momma's old house so much
That her fixed income ain't enough income and now she forced to move out
Of the house she lived in for the last 30 years
And raised two generations of kids, but it is what it is, ain't it?
The neighborhood got more Volvos and less Chevy's
Candy-coated painted because now
Well now your street is so charming and alarming, ain't it?
The sight of your neighbors being shipped out
Handed hollow vouchers to move to a place unfamiliar
This, this be the new slave ship
Go ahead, go ahead and visit the new cool kids on your block
Tell them the story of the haunted trap house
Where the ghosts of dope boys still shed tears
How you tried to get the city to tear down this nightmare for the last three years
Won't you tell them how, the deferred dreams of high school hopes
Would sit on its porch waiting
To snatch the soul from whoever walked by
Still looking for a way out this hood
The same hood that holds the street corner
The same corner your cousin died on
They repaved it and renamed it something expensive
Something you can barely afford to stand on this block
Don't feel like it used to
Now the folks next door call cops on you when your friends roll through
It's strange how things don' changed around you
Hey, they call this progress baby
When they come for you
They will say it's for the best
To clean up the mess
They will call it restoration
Wanna free you from the mortgage or that rent
And give you a new destination
They sellin' you false emancipation
Wanna reshape your school and call it reeducation
Now add a new word to your vocabulary young blood
It's called gentrification
 (x2)
Mafia business, niggas snitchin'
Then they gone murder ya'
Keep yo lil' money, If I don't know ya' then I ain't servin' ya
Fuckin' they bitches, now they claimin' that they gone murder us
Fuck with you hangin', what you claimin?
Nigga come swerve on ya'

Mafia business, if he snitchin', take out his whole team
Three million cash, had to weigh it up on the coke beam
Niggas be flippin', servin' chicken, trapped out some Popeyes
Walkin' up lettin' loose on you nigga ain't no drive-by
Glock-40 on me with extension, don't be approachin' me
Fucked his lil' bitty, now he claimin' he wanna murder me
Catch him in traffic, while he lackin', give him a 3rd-degree
Sniper with rifles, whip that pistol, I can do surgery
Ain't no new faces, I don't know ya' then I don't serve ya' nigga
Mafia shit, if he snitchin', you gettin' mudered nigga
Askin' me questions, you won't get nun', cause I ain't seen shit
Fuck who you know and where you from, nigga that don't mean shit
 (x2)
Mafia business, niggas snitchin'
Then they gone murder ya'
Keep yo lil' money, If I don't know ya' then I ain't servin' ya
Fuckin' they bitches, now they claimin' that they gone murder us
Fuck with you hangin', what you claimin?
Nigga come swerve on ya'
Get my papers ready for the drought
Trying to make a route
Riding with a stap make a niggers want to take me out
Yea where i’m from niggers dont really make it out
I am wishing i was free like when the breeze blow
And I’m just another lion in the jungle
Gun fights and rumble
I bust my own color s
And i know from when niggers dont make it out
Yea i wishing i was free like when wind blow

Mother fuck my PO finger to the CO
You asking me for dick for hitting niggers with the rico
Noodles mixed with cheetos can i get some burritos
Commissary stay straight shout out to my boy rico
Thugging with some niggers they really were my niggers
They wrote things on me the plots got thicker
I redo my motion confused feeling hopeless
These accusations bogus they lying and they know it
These niggers stress the truth like pilates or aerobics
Just to save there own ass because they don't want to take the fall
Like a motherfucking man so they snitched on their dog
Bitches around you when you ballin they always leave when you fall
I don't need no new friends bitches i fucked them all
Recorded on my Iphone and showed to my fucking dogs
Jail ain't no place to be niggers snitching like its cool
It's here men for themselves these niggers out here breaking rules
I wish i was free cause we slaves only street
Been harassed by these cops for having gold on our teeth
Niggers want to take my life that's why i’m riding with the heat
That's why i have the blood of Jesus
I know he watching over me
Should i fear no man but God even though he ain’t a man
I ain’t backing down from sheit you niggers bleed like i care
Young niggers choppers bought my city like iran
But we hustle just to eat fuck you if you disagree
Hustling in the drought trying to make a route
Grind strap banking niggers want to take me out oh yeah
Cause where i’m from they hope niggers don't make it out
Yeah wishing i was free like when wind blows
And i’m just another lion in the jungle
Gun fights and rumbles i lost my own color
And you know from when niggers dont make it out
I am wishing i was free like when wind blows
Fist fights and drama ghetto baby mama’s
Knocked up with no purpose sex without no condoms
Mass full of robbers they kids needs christmas
I’m getting scared of these murders i maybe another victim
These niggers in the system the judge trying to leach them
So free my brother too cause Lord knows i miss him
The police kill mi nigga they though he had a pistol
My niece starting to get noticed starting to look like my sister
My heart getting colder i’m starting to lose all my feelings
Fuck the mother of my kids but i take care of my children
I focus on my craft and now my better half
Two bitches want me my nigga do the math
My granny in the hood i’m trying to move her out
So she can see the world and i bought my momma that house
And saved to make advance to buy my brother out
So he can be free like when the wind blows

My paper ready for the drought trying
Trying to make a route
Riding with a stap make a nigga want to take me out
Yea where i’m from niggers dont really make it out
I am wishing i was free like when the breeze blow
And i’m just another lion in the jungle
Gun fights and rumbles
I bust my own color
And i know from when niggers dont make it out
Yea i wishing i was free like when wind blow
Chorus x 2
Thugged out and all my niggas gangster
I ain't friendly nigga I don't fuck with strangers
All I know is Danger
Fuck around and you gon' feel that banger
Hit you from a mile away they long rangers
All I know is danger

All you hear is bang, bang
They banging on my block
Oh Lord, oh my, somebody dun got shot
Now all you see is them choppers
Somebody finna get chopped
This murder shit don't stop
We retaliate no spot
Don't nobody talk to the cops
Niggas live by the code
Let's find out where they're staking
Shit, I know somebody gone know
And I know somebody know something
All them people outside
How the fuck none of y'all ain't seen nothing
Load them choppers nigga let's ride
I got homocide on my mind
Four deep and we ride
And in them chevy's nigga we flying
Hurt so bad my nigga I'm crying
Ain't no music and ain't no talking
Shoot the first nigga walking
In they hood, on they street
I'mma get them while none get me
I hit two my nigga hit three
Won't be the end of this beef
Im on pills don't need no sleep
Eyes up open up by the week?
Bitch it's dangerous where I've been
Dangerous where I roam
Always on point
Don't go nowhere without my chrome
And it's danger
Chorus x 2

Because all I know is murder
All I see is crime
Get the fuck from out of dodge
When bullets go the flying, better D-U-C-K nigga
Try your luck you think I'm lying
And you be riding in that hearse
Laying in a box that's pine
It's a hazard to your health
Don't you ever fuck with mine
Bitch I'm strapped up with that nine
And it shoot about thirty times
I got killers on my spor
That will knock you out for free
And I put that on 
Rest in peace my nigga look beat
Charlotte nigga trigger happy
20 murders in a week
Every time I watch the news, shit that's all the fuck I see
Another dead black male, just a victim of the gun
Nigga at age 21, see them choppers better run
Niggas ain't shooting to scare
They ain't shooting for fun
Niggas been killing for so long to the pain they go numb
Niggas knocking out your brain, then they living on the run
I'm strapped up all the time, won't catch me without my gun
Bitch you know it's danger
Chorus x 2
Finally made it out the gutter where they
Now everybody acting like they fuck with me
Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Plenty nights I went to sleep without nothing to eat
Guess that's why hood niggas love the beef
Love that body without loving me
Gave hugs to the ones without hugging me
All them nights I cried ain't get no sleep
Halloween in my hood ain't get no treat
On the first day of school ain't get no sneaks
It's no wonder why them other kids picked on me
Say a prayer for anyone who ever shit on me
I got love for my woman, she ain't quit on me
All that bullshit I did she could've been left me
Still running out of gas with my tank on E
With my babies in the car now I'm feeling ashamed
Putting five in the tank gotta scrape up some change
Dedicate this to my momma cause she gave me the game
She told me hold my head up and start embracing my change

Finally made it out the gutter where they want me to be
Now everybody acting like they fuck with me
Had to work my ass off it wasn't luck for me
I ain't going no where I guess you stuck with me
Finally made it out the gutter where they want me to be
Now everybody wanna know what's up with me
Finally seeing things they ain't want me to see
I ain't going nowhere I guess you stuck with me

Having talks with our day about lust and women
Told me bro I ain't perfect bro I'm the one to admit it
Been my dog since them days I was getting suspended
Living on the boulevard now I'm out of them trenches
My desire still there now I'm dealing with enemies (police)
Safe to say they don't fuck with my kinfolk
But I ain't ashamed guess it's part of the game
Nigga can't enjoy the sun without dealing with rain
Tune hit me on the phone tryna hide his stress
Cause the judge gave him 20 and he doing the state
That's a hard pill to swallow I ain't know what to say
Told him keep ya' head up and try to walk by faith
Certain things you can't change it's controlled by fate
But Imma always have your back every step of the way
Living right, I ain't tryna throw my blessings away
Hit my niece, say a prayer cause I ain't stressing today

Finally made it out the gutter where they
Now everybody acting like they fuck with me
Auntie died, me and Corey got close
I can see it in his eyes that his heart growing colder
I still got my mama, so I don't know his pain
Death brought us back together, got me thinking what a shame
Got 2 sons months apart, we be dealing with the same
Fucking women a vice for me, I'm dealing with the pain
Lost my lady, too destructive, she don't look at me the same
I didn't want to let her go but hell I had to make a change
Rapping all I got besides the love for my sons
Tune turned himself in cause he was living on the run
Say he wanted for a murder, he was strapped with a gun
Judge did my brother dirty cause they ain't give him no bond
Hurt me to my heart, he ain't never heard my son
Talked to him on the phone but I can tell in his voice
He trying to stay strong, he ain't got no other choice
Told me "'Niro you gon' make it, just exercise your voice."
Me and Sosa falling out, I just want him to listen
I find myself getting distracted, not completing my mission
Rappers in my city thinking that we in competition
But I'm in my own lane, we just hustling different
Me and Duru still cool but we don't talk that much
Since we went our separate ways we barely keeping in touch
I can't tell you when it changed but it don't feel the same
But I swear it's all love bruh, keep doing your thing
Made a movie out in Kansas thanks to Rico James
JR I ain't forgot ya boy, keep doing your thing
Bossy riding til the end, G you family too
They got my back, I got they back
Cause that's what families do
I don't tell you all the time but bruh I love you the same
If you could do it all over you wouldn't do it the same
But we live and we learn, I can tell that ya changed
Family treat a nigga different now, they think that I'm famous
But attention is a drug that I'm struggling wit
I can't lie, deep down I love fucking these bitches
I ain't never treat 'em right, now I'm seeking forgiveness
Jasmine never lied to me, such a beautiful spirit
Never did it for the groupies, hoes, cars, or Bentleys
I ain't really into cars but want that S55
Shout out to my brothers Gio, Don Don, and Bentley
Rest in peace to Aunt Pam I know you right here with me
Everytime I call Wendel he was coming to get me
Never told me bullshit or raised his hand to hit me
All my exes still checking, always saying they miss me
But I'd rather be alone, solitude, no movies
But my mind my change, Gemini's so moody
My duality is real I feel like two different people
That's why I struggle with commitment
Cause one woman can't equal
Up to everything I need so I take them in sequels
I'm Starving
I Ain't talking about no artist
If a nigga balling in the club, Imma rob him
Body bag full of fuck nigga, go grab a coffin
California kush be the reason why I'm coughing
Get jacked for the excess floss
And hoes be in my view, so be cautious
Youny niggas, they ain't do no talking
Died in a jet, but I ain't Tom Coffin
Screaming "Fuck How You Feel"
Ain't no other nigga kick shit like this
Cuz them other niggas ain't got my skill
I'm too real to ever be fake
They too fake to ever be real
Took my time, perfected my craft
Now its time to see me some mills
Fuck nigga
Why the hell you hating on my generation
Squeezing guns with no hesitating
For any kind of altercation
Living life fast with no time for patience
Breaking down dope, cuz its reefer baby
Screen door slammin', hide and go it
Icee from the truck got 5 flavors in it
Old folk grinnin', hopscotch skippin'
Quarter water sippin', telling jokes trippin'
Look at how we livin', you should come and visit
The hood like Crooklyn, but I ain't from Brooklyn
Knock, knock, zoom, zoom, down the block bookin'
Everything was sweet when a dime bought a cookie
Stonewashed pants, Adidas shelltoes
Tears in your eyes from you tryna pick your fro
Street lights on, ghetto running loose
Mama calling for us so I gotta chunk the deuce
Had roaches in the crib, mouse trap down
Every now and then you might hear a gun sound
Stay reminecing, damn I miss the 90's
LA Gear sneakers, and watching Moesha
Dealers on the block with they Glocks and they beepers
Watching All That reruns on Nick at Nite
The world done changed, it don't feel right
We used to stick together, now all we do is fight damn

You remember catching lightning bugs outside and shit nigga
Watching Nickelodeon and shit nigga, All That
Chasing the ice cream truck down the block
Remember that shit?

NBA Jam, Stretch Armstrong
Easy Bake Oven I can go on and on
Remember Power Rangers? Remember Captain Planet?
Watching Wishbone with my lil' cousin Sammy
Saved by the Bell, hidey ho Winslow
Blowing in the cartridge of your Super Nintendo
Bill Nye the Science Guy's where you got your info
Step By Step and TGIF
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Will Smith, Jazzy Jeff
Just to name a few but I got way more left
Blowing up balloons 'til I'm running out of breath
Celebrity Death Match where they always killed the ref
Remember house parties? Remember House Party?
Sneak and watching porn where the bullshit started
Baddest man hit my hand, telling yo mama jokes
Hit the store with food stamps, all of our mamas broke
Getting WIC vouchers, bread and them eggs
Juicy Juice and peanut butter kept a nigga fed
Getting beat with switches til it's welts on your legs
Mama tell you that she loves you then she send yo ass to bed
Leprechaun in the hood, Tales from the hood
Watching Rugrats made my soul feel good
Kool-Aid Icee, plastic on the sofa
Who love orange soda? Kell love orange soda
Goosebump books, make you feel cool
Leaving class early cause you're part of Right Moves
Tissue in the tape before the mixtapes
Waiting by the radio for your song to play
Mama made as hell I recorded over her tape
Jerry Springer going down, they fighting bout everyday
Damn I miss the 90's, in every single way
Feel bad cause the new generation don't even play, damn

Nigga remember we used to play outside 'til the motherfucking streetlights came on and yo mama yelled down the block like "Dante get your motherfucking ass in this house 'for I beat your ass." Nigga remember gotdamn slapboxing and shit? You smack the shit out of one of your friends and then that nigga go home crying and shit, wanna take his mom back and go in the house and shit.

But hey, you know what I'm saying? It's all love you know what I'm saying. This for them 80's babies and shit, them early 90's babies and shit
Cliff of Death nigga
Life or death nigga
If you have a silver spoon then we are not the same
I'm a product of the drug game

16 years old I was on the block
Fuck a education I was selling rocks
Seventeen I bought a AK-47
Then they killed my nigga Corey hope he up in heaven
Just a nigga with a dream tryna make it rappen
Addicted to the drug money tryna make it trappen
Wet work to the dry set it in a napkin
Lost niggas in the system don't know how it happened
Pockets got fat now I'm paying rent
At my momma crib stashed my pistol in the vent
She said a hard head make a soft ass
I don't give a fuck I'm rolling blunts and skipping class
Eighteen years old caught my first charge
Late night on the block hanging with my boys
I ain't have a childhood,never played with toys
Momma did all she could but I made the choice
I'm a hustler

Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah
Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah
Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah
Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah,Ah

I was nineteen working with a whole peak
Never had a daddy so a nigga ran the streets
Hit licks with some niggas did some B&E's
But they stand me in the back for the fucking cheese
Caught some cases now I'm stressing about them lawyer fees
Tryed to work with them crackers but they lawyer me
Got the surge,ran right back to the streets
Pledge allegiance to the game with my loyalty
Greedy for the money ain't nobody shorting me
Bitch I'm broke so why the fuck he extorting me?
Problem child momma wishes she aborted me
Tears running down her eyes while they cuffing me
Just a nigga with a record they'll love to see
Not amount to shit what a damn shame
If you have a silver spoon we are not the same
I'm a product of the struggle and the dope game


My nigga I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But if you out here in these streets and you making moves
Trust none and make sure your on your p's & q's
Watch them niggas that you serve,gotta pick and choose
All money ain't good that's a lose-lose
Don't be petty out here hustling for no tennis shoes
Don't be fronting all your work when the rent due
And if you keep coming short that's an issue
Watch what your saying homie cause your line tapped
Serving work out your crib get your kidnapped
Don't you ever give a nigga an unloaded strap
Seen a nigga take his closest homie off the map
My nigga I'm just telling you what I done seen
Can't sleep cause I keep having bad dreams
Everywhere I go its like a gotta watch my back
Paranoid don't go nowhere without the mac


Said you always saw it
Come into my home
See into my sea
Breath into my breath
Third eye third
Come get a slice
Of elevation pie
Let it get you high
Energy never lie
Kiss me but never tell
They say love is blind
My heart is made of 
Why don't climb up on top of me
Universe watches me
Fuck until this morning
I like buns with no poppy seeds
She don't fuck with GMOs
And all she smoke is broccoli
And I been dealing in rapping
Rapping 'n dealing
Focused on me has
Manifested until my money stacked to the ceiling
I've been stacking and rapping
Rapping and stacking
But my karma way too deep for my actions
I swear I hate it
I don't fear death no more
Just reincarnation
Heart of a soldier
With the brain to teach a nation
I've been running out of patience
Lately I've been elevating
Working on the best version of me
That's what I told my old lady

Come into my home
See into my sea
Breath into my breath
Third eye third
Come get a slice
Of elevation pie
Let it get you high
Energy never lie
Kiss me but never tell
They say love is blind
My heart is made of 
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
I don't fuck around with molly
But I might just hit your weed
I don't want them GMOs
That they selling in them stores
Used to eat 'em back then
But I don't like 'em no more
Searching for my sin
& meditating under trees
Reading books to my sons
Picnic with my lady
Lovebirds in the trees
I do shit you wouldn't believe
Looking at my babies
They're a reflection me
Looking at yourself
Nigga tell me what you see
I can stand here today
And say I'm happy being me
If I had to meet myself
I'd be one to meet

Come into my home
See into my sea
Breath into my breath
Third eye third
Come get a slice
Of elevation pie
Let it get you high
Energy never lie
Kiss me but never tell
They say love is blind
My heart is made of 
Kill your idols, sawed-off rifles
Have niggas bleedin' like a menstrual cycle
Claimin' that title; nigga, what title?
Chopper make 'em dance like a ballet recital

Played up with motherfuckin' low cash
Tryin' to get rich with my broke ass
Nigga need bread, I'm lookin' for some more cash
Sick of blowin' back, yo, and now I wanna blow gas
Forty on deck, and nigga I'm gon' blast
Money ain't power, catch up yo' ho ass
Run up on the dope man, with a black mask
You know what it is, nigga, take me to your stash
Now I'm dippin', outta that exit
Whip that dope, make sure I stretch it
Gotta figure free, goddamn good investment
Now I'm known as that little nigga with a nest egg
Fuck that, nigga, blow a hundred on a necklace
Mossberg pump 'case shit get hectic
Badass bitch laid up at the Westin
Feed me grits, cigarillos full of Welch's
Nigga, I'm a badman, badman
Twenty-five thousand dollars cash, man
Have them killers jumpin' out yo trash can
With them red dots on yo Ray-Bans
And I beat a bitch pussy like a caveman
Whip that Benz like a slave master
You can try to run from me but my chopper faster
'Bout to lay the competition out in front of the pastor, nigga


Kill your idol, even if he me
Mossberg blow takin' off a nigga knee
In the middle of the war zone, that's where I be
Hand on my strap cause a nigga got beef
And that bitch suck dick like she ain't got teeth
Eliminatin' all competition with the heat
Illuminati illuminatin' and niggas can't see
Lame ol' flake is something I can't be
Leave it as an idol, something I can't see
Role model for your kids, my nigga, that ain't me
Better go to church, my nigga, I don't preach
I can only reach the one that I see

Rollin' up blunts with they mouth full of fronts
Ride shotgun with the front seat slumped
I still black cause he just got jumped
Lookin' for them bitch niggas with the Mossberg pump
Lay down, deep breaths
Count to 10, nod your head

Ugh
Shorty feel different when we on them drugs
Good girl but fell in love with a thug
I don't wanna hit the block and I don't wanna club
Netflix on the couch, cuddle up with her
Sticking to the plays, never huddle up
Undress her slow, have her cumming in a rush
Hate to see me go, I never tell her "bye"
It's cheating in her eyes if I tell her lies
Brand new whip, brand new titties
Brand new bitties come with every city
Down to fuck any nigga rollin' with me
Bag full of drugs just to keep me up
Phone full of hoes and they down to fuck
It get rough, cause all I think about is her
Shit, we FaceTime every time my show over
G5 Benz, she don't do no Range Rover
She say we growing distant so I hold her closer
She coming back cause I never give her closure
I like the way you smell, I love the way you fuck
Let's make some pretty babies baby but it ain't a rush
Haha

Never fell in love, now I'm catchin' feelings
What goos is being rich if you can't share it with me?
Breakfast in your bed, waking up to head
She never complaining 'bout how I get this bread
I promise I'll be home before you go to sleep
Tell me 'bout your day, while I rub your feet
She scared for her nigga, cause I'm in these streets
Livin' by the gun, ridin' with my heat
She in love with her nigga, cause I keep it G
Fuckin' up her 'do when we in them sheets
I swear to God, we don't be getting no sleep
And it's all war cause we don't no peace
Family talkin' down, they don't know me
It's really "fuck 'em," but my feelings low key
She good with her nigga, she got the dough key
Touchdown nigga, and that pussy deep
Take a quick break, roll more weed
Round two, now you're 'bout to go to sleep
Took a quick break, and roll more weed
Round two, now you're 'bout to go to sleep

I mean it's like
Every time you be with a nigga, you know what I mean?
You just tell me you're so worry free
You be so stressed out, when you be, I don't know
Fuckin' with that nigga and shit
Nigga a motherfuckin' liar
Yo, KOBK the murder gang
World on my shoulders
Heart getting colder, sons getting older
Gotta raise 'em to be soldiers
Teach 'em morals and values
Keep your pistol for these vultures
Cause everyday you close

And I got the world on my shoulders
Heart getting colder, sons getting older
Gotta raise 'em to be soldiers
Teach 'em morals and values
Keep your pistol for these vultures
Cause everyday you closer
Name a crime and I done done it
Trying to get some money, cause it wasn't coming
Fast, shit I was hungry
Tired of being bummy, and treated like a dummy
How the fuck you got my back nigga, If you always frontin'?
Told my sons if they gon' do it, then do it like you love it
Say a prayer for my auntie cause she still get beat by her husband
Family don't mean shit to me, unless they about my cousin
And if we control our destiny, well I guess I had that coming
And school was never for me, cause they ain't wanna teach me
Got passed with failing grades cause they ain't think I was gon' be
Who I am today, I did this shit with no degree
They destroyed our community and the violence be unity

And the felonies they ruined me, nigga this ain't make believe
Got corrupted by TV to worship all this vanity
Selling dope to all my people, fucking with my sanity
Fighting with these demons and I swear they be commanding me
Gotta take control cause I know its a better man than me
Nigga be yourself cause that gangsta shit ain't impressing me
Prison or an early grave, there wasn't much left for me
I managed to stay out they way, I figured out the recipe
I only talk to bosses so you workers stop addressing me
Made it out the hood without no phony niggas next to me
Winded by my problems, all these bill collectors stressing me
But I still got my crib doe, somehow the Lord keep blessing me
Chopper need bullets, sons need pampers
Niggas got so many questions but they rarely find the answers
Chopper need bullets, sons need pampers
Niggas got so many questions but they rarely find the answers
Fuck like I love her
In the morning I be gone
Called and I ignored her
Now she blowin up my phone
Nigga this how felt when we wrote juice
Stuck to the script
Now I'm starring in the movie
Women used to diss me
Now they follow in my movement
Nigga pay attention
Let me show you how I do it
All about the money and power
Nigga I get it
What's the point of that
If you ain't working on your spirit
Keep all your excuses, baby
I don't want to hear it
Death is all around us
It ain't nobody I'm fearing
Niggas finna pay attention
Fuck my pockets 
Tribe all around me
Everybody with me shooters
Nigga kill a G
Now I'm ridin' with the ruger
Got me searching for peace
I meditating like the Buddha
Praying for forgiveness
Because they know they did me wrong

Fuck like I love her
In the morning I be gone
Called and I ignored her
Now she blowin up my phone
I say knick, knack, paddywack
I hit her with the bone
Everybody changing
Cuz they know a nigga on
Story of my life
This ain't just another song
Coolin with the people
Nigga that's where you can catch me
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head, nigga that's me
Story of my life
Can't nobody tell it but me
Dissin all the women that ain't used to want to fuck me
Now I'm getting money
Everybody say they love me
Story of my life
Can't nobody tell it but me
Dissin all the women that ain't used to want to fuck me
Now I'm getting money
Everybody say they love me

You just know my name
But you don't know my story
There's way too many gimmicks
These rap niggas corny
They asking where I been
Cuz I been out the mix
Just stayin' out the way
It keeps me out of shit
I hear the small talking
I see the phony fives
I can't respect a man
That can't look me in the eyes
Run and tell these rap niggas
It's time for you to change your career, feel
I see these niggas still running on the treadmill
Heading nowhere fast
And I bet you say you fucking stole for that cash, huh
These niggas opportunists
How could you say we ain't never helped you
Run out of gas
We run you out and shelfed you
We gon' be alright
Either way it goes
I embrace my imperfections
There's nothing to expose
I can't respect these rappers
Because they be on that ho shit
Loyalty is real
So don't hit me with that bro shit
I told Deniro keep your feet on solid ground
You gon' be the one to make it
Don't let 'em bring you down
Put your soul in that music
And know doubts and hesitation can affect your execution

Story of my life
Can't nobody tell it but me
Dissin all the women that ain't used to want to fuck me
Now I'm getting money
Everybody say they love me
Turn that motherfucking shit down
Nigga what the fuck you want from me
Nigga you know what the fuck I want, nigga

Started thinking to myself why the fuck should I bother

Baby tell me what you want
Tell me what you feel
I can make you 
Something that's real
Half on the baby
I can pay your bills
If you ever hungry, you can have my meal
Rollin' like a coaster
Gun in the holster
Smooth when I approach
Intellect focused
Baby girl noticed
Other niggas hopeless
Elevate her mind
Now she open like a lotus
I ain't gotta fuck to make your mind 
Had a climax and I didn't even have to touch
Body activated
She loving my patience
Threw the pussy at me
But we better off waiting
Want me so bad
Now she begging me to taste
Fucked her so good she ain't had that 
Even though we separate
Our souls came together
Got music, incense
Make her feel special
Half on the baby
I pay the rent
Locked eyes once
Been connected ever since
That was ten years ago
Now we almost thirty
Unafraid to grow
A little age won't hurt me
Scrambled up them eggs
Butt naked in the kitchen
Bend her over just to lick it
Fuck it if we break the dishes
Food getting cold
Heat it up and remix it
No pun intended but baby we can't kick it
Damn you look good
And your body like a vixen
But I got a lady baby so this ain't the right time
Maybe next night time
When we turn to butterflies
I don't even smoke weed
But you got me so high

Baby tell me what you want
Tell me what you feel
I can make you 
Something that's real
Half on the baby
I can pay your bills
If you ever hungry, you can have my meal
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you feel
Couple months late
It is what it is
Treat you like you 
Baby you can have my ribs
Cheated all the time
But I swear that I'll stop
Bought a bunch of land
Just to grow our own crops
The love gon' continue
Even when my heart stop
Got me reading to your belly top
Baby girl drop
Fell in love with you like you was hip hop
And I'm dealing with duality
You know I feel flopped
You love both sides
And for that I gotta thank you
Bad on purpose
Because you love when I spank you
Known for destruction
But baby I want to build
Brick by brick
Like a brand new crib
Mama don't like you
Brother want to fight you
None of that matters
Baby, because you still 
I had sons when I met you
And they looked just like me
But that ain't the point
I'm getting off subject
Swimming in your body
Backstroking in your tummy
Love the way you taste
Baby it's so yummy
When I first met you
I was plugged out and slummy
Now I'm liberated
And I'm getting to the money
That ain't why you with me
You don't care about the money
Even when the scene dark
Your love made it sun & shit


Baby tell me what you want
Tell me what you feel
I can make you 
Something that's real
Half on the baby
I can pay your bills
If you ever hungry, you can have my meal
Yo, free Tune. That's my bro.
(2x)
Can't get sleep, (why?) newborn hungry (yup)
Woke up in the bed with a bitch who don't want me
Voices in my head keep telling me to pray
I ain't got shit to my name but this AK

And I'm just a fucking victim to them voices in my head
Been with her for so long yet she a stranger in my bed
She told me I ain't shit, she wish that I was dead
Sick of feeling hunger pains, smoking til my eyes red
Fuck eating a crumb, boy I want a slice of bread
Don't know how to be a father, and that feeling got me scared
I'm looking in the mirror, and don't know what I see
A reflection of my past and it's still haunting me
I wake up to hearing screams, hit the block and serve fiends
Gotta feed my fucking son, you know what the fuck I mean?
And I can't get sleep, he crying cause he hungry
Tried to do his mama right, that bitch didn't want me and I...
(hook 2x)

And the only thing I own is this mothafuckin choppa
Sick in the head, I think I need to see a doctor
She always going clubbing, she forcing me to watch him
I feed him then I change him then I set him in his rocker
I should've known better; shit, his mama was a bopper
But that ain't no excuse cause I'm still that baby's papa
Thinking bout them days crying on my mama lap
Asking bout my daddy, shit I wonder where he at?
She looked at me and said that he ain't never coming back
But what she really meant is he was somewhere smoking crack
So ever since that day I put my family on my back
Walking round with my choppa feeling like I'm in Iraq, and I...
(hook 2x)
P.S.A. to all you fuck niggas, mayne. Out here riding rims, throwing money, think y'all doing it big... Take care of your mothafuckin kids nigga. Y'all out here flexing for these mothafuckin hoes nigga, that ain't good business my nigga. Y'all out here popping all that bullshit about all this money you got but your kids out here hurting? Man up fuck nigga
We livin in a time
Where the police are killing us
And they don't consider it crime
Hungry for attention
She starving in the mind
Searching for a god
Not lost, show a nigga signs
They be rappin' with no message
Guess they do it for some shine
Fuck what you believe
I'm serious when I speak
Slang in my speech
Just to reach 'em when I teach
Best-kept secret
I'm no longer a mystique
I have one foot in the game
I have one foot in the street
Wash my hands with the trap
Had to rinse and then repeat
Obstacles in my way
I would not accept defeat
Cuz nigga I've been hungry out there
Living on the street
Had holes in my clothes
And the shoes on my feet
Look what I became
What they said I'd never be
I sit my hustle on the bench
Cuz them laws tryna play us
Break my heart to see them sell again
Fuck out they bodega

So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of  selling alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine
So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of Christians selling alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine

And I'm just living life 
Taking everything that's mine
Me and her against the world
She watch my back
I got her spine
Accountable for everything
I spit off in my rhymes
Sick of living on my feet
So it's time to make a climb
Money the root of evil
And them trees keep on growing
They say marijuana legal
Tell them pigs, free my homies
They tryna knock the hustle
And the government condone it
They was tryna feed their family
They  paid they rent
Ever since the war on drugs
Shit ain't been right ever since
Up in Denver Colorado them
The white boys getting rich
But them niggas in my ghetto
Getting murdered over cents
With all the evidence
I sit my hustle on the bench
Cuz them laws tryna play us
Break my heart to see them sell again
Fuck out they bodega
Shake my head and walk away
Close your eyes and say a prayer
To whoever you think is there

So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of  selling alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine
So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of Christians selling fucking alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine

And I'm kicking that knowledge
I'm spitting that knowledge
I'm tellin' you niggas it's real
Dedicate this song to Cory
Lost his life behind the wheel
Never heard the full story
Just a victim of the steel
Having vivid memories
Of 
Left them babies in the world
All alone, feeling confused
Better get your life together
For the same happen to you
All the shit that I been through
Come walk a mile in my shoes
And you will see why I'm so real
And got the passion like I do
Had to save my fuckin' self
Because I wanted to save the youth
I used to have these talks with 
Then I seen him on the news
Pray for guap and pray for g
Shit big boss say that's my plug
Screaming free my brother tune
That's my motherfucking blood
Fuck the DA and the Judge
Tried to drag him through the mud
All this hatred in the world
Just ain't no magic it's true love
I sit my hustle on the bench
Cuz them laws tryna play us
Break my heart to see them sell again
Fuck out they bodega

So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of  selling alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine
So tell them niggas respect your mind
Half of Christians selling fucking alcohol to they kind
Don't take no advice from broke niggas
Or one who be swine
Make decisions with your heart
And everything will be fine
KIRA what's happenin?
DuRu I see you
Magic, tell em watch that lean

I strive to do better (baby)
I'll die before I let em (change me)
I'll die before I let em (change me)
I strive to do better (baby)

Now I know how putting on feels
Niggas don't do it like I do it, so excuse me
Stepping on stars fuck a bitch from Mars
Gotta keep that five drop six in the bong is really what you heard
Is really who we are who would ever think I'd make it this far
Look at their faces mama I made it standing ovation
Yeah I remember y'all used to talk about me
Now them same niggas and them same hoes wanna hang around me
Now watch me lean while I lean lean while I do my thang clean
And I'm stacking cream this was all a dream
Still I ride (still I ride)
And stay high (and stay high)
Don't know night (don't know night)
But get life (but get life)
We alright (we alright)
Now watch me lean while I lean lean while I do my thang

And that bitch can't tell me nothing (and that bitch can't tell me nothing)
Nigga I feel like stunting (nigga I feel like stunting)
And that bitch can't tell me nothing (and that bitch can't tell me nothing)
Nigga I feel like stunting (nigga I feel like stunting)
Now watch me lean while I lean lean while I do my thang clean
And I'm stacking cream this was all a dream
And the bitch can't tell me nothing (bitch can't tell me nothing)
Nigga I feel like stunting (nigga I feel like stunting)
So what fools be humble
You can hear me come
My ? be flow
Flow like my car running
Watch out for them jackers trying to run me off my burner
And I'm fresh from out the mall, so it make no earning
30's on the whip, ain't no scrubbing when I'm turn it
Watch me lean while I (watch me lean while I) now your bitch get nervous
Cause I drive fast like I'm always in a hurry
And my fur seat on recline blowing purple pine
You know my bitch dime there's thirty in my nine
My pistol got no holster all my niggas killers
Please do not provoke them they will bum one of you niggas
And I'm on my way to mine VIP eternal
DONTREZZ that I throw up Purple Kush and I roll up
Watch me lean (watch me lean, watch me lean) better stay in your place
Cause that 40 ho ? bust that bitch up in your place

Now watch me lean while I lean lean while I do my thang clean
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
Been riding with my pistol
Since my homie got shot
Baby telling me come home
But my home is the block
This the life a nigga chose
So is you rollin or not?
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
I've been screaming fuck the system
Since my brother got locked
Mama tell me go to church
But I'm chasing this guap
And I ain't serving no new faces
That's how niggas get bought

Give you two for a quarter
Give you four for a fifty
Ain't enough for me to meet you
If you want it, come get it
Can't be cuffing these bitches
Once your partner done hit it
Red beams on all the pistols
But my partners ain't missing
We got choppas and dracos
Money made me an A-hole
Step on that fucking work
And stretch it out like this play-doh
Mad Max with a peso
Molly 
Score a movement like monsters
Drink Cabernet with the posse
Niggas say they some killas
But they ain't on the motion
Daddy left me and mama
I hit the streets wide open
Servning junkies their water
Smokin' blunts with my brother
Say a prayer for my mama
Cuz Lord knows she be stressing
I cut out most of my niggas
Cuz they wasn't one hundred
Tune writing my letters
Say he got caught with a shank
60 days in the hole
He told me brother 
That's why I'm snapping on niggas
And going hard in the paint

Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
Been riding with my pistol
Since my homie got shot
Baby telling me come home
But my home is the block
This the life a nigga chose
So is you rollin or not?
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
I've been screaming fuck the system
Since my brother got locked
Mama tell me go to church
But I'm chasing this guap
And I ain't serving no new faces
That's how niggas get bought

Give you two for the fourty
Give you four for the eighty
Doing what I got to do
Just to provide for my babies
Mama say that I'm lazy
Cuz I won't get a job
Before I work for nine dollars
Mama, I'd rather rob
Told her straight to her face
Looked her dead in the eyes
And said my daddy was a gangsta
Tell me, why you surprised
Dumpin work in the kitchen
I be baking them pies
Had a run-in with them laws
Told them nothing but lies
Name on some paperwork
You still shoppin for dope?
Well, you ain't welcome in this trap
I ain't gonna tell you no more
Mama tell me go to church
But I'm too deep in the game
Here religion and racism just one and the same

Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
Been riding with my pistol
Since my homie got shot
Baby telling me come home
But my home is the block
This the life a nigga chose
So is you rollin or not?
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know that I'm not
I've been screaming fuck the system
Since my brother got locked
Mama tell me go to church
But I'm chasing this guap
And I ain't serving no new faces
That's how niggas get bought
