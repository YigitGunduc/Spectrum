There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future
But through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that!
Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah

Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!

Smile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me (Smile)
(What you lookin' all sad for?
Nigga, you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me
(Nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile? (No doubt, smile for me now)
Just smile (And the next generation)

Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!

Smile for me, won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me
Smile for me
Won't you smile? Just smile

Fuck the world, as we elope and witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is "Fuck friends!" – we military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga

And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

Smile, smile for me
All you need to do is smile
Woooo smile for me
Come on, smile for me
Talk to me man…
This ya boy Young Hova, yo, turn the muh'fuckin noise up
We can get right into the proceedings this evening
Headphones are distortin', bring it down a lil' bit
Okay, now we workin' wit it
The boy Face up in Baseline (Face Mob!)
Welcome to New York City
It’s ya boy Young Hov' (chyea!)
Kanye West on the track
Chi-Town, what’s goin' on now?
Can I talk to y'all for a minute?
Lemme talk to y'all for a minute
(Just gimme a minute of ya time baby, I don’t want much)
Lemme talk to these muh'fuckas, uhh

Guess who's bizack? You still smellin' crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them road; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do nuttin' with it, straight from the oven with it
Came from the dirt, I emerged from it all
Without a stain on my shirt; you can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling guts every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Face Mob, every time we face-off
Face it, y'all, y'all niggas playing basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall
Homey, I'm in the drop with the AC on
That's why the streets embrace me dawg, I'm so cool

Guess who's bizack? Back on the block with them O's
Face Mob, Mack Mittens and Hov'
Don't make me relapse, back to the block with the four
Cause this street shit is all I know

From the womb to the tomb, a hot pot a jar and a spoon
Trying to make me forty thousand and move
Motels, star-studded, rock stars and goons
Plain clothes wanna run in my room (woooo)
But nigga guess who's bizack? It's ya boy Face Mob
Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake dawg
Give niggas a break, nah; you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? No
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the 88
Don't got no wholesale, cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue and that's on the fo' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make fo' sho' I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war and you ain't making a dime (haha!)
Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking, gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game brewin', lemme give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'mma give ya the blues
It's a new game goin', lemme give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'mma give ya the blues, whoa (haha!)

Guess who's bizack? The boy B. Mizack, AKA Mr. Crack-A-Brick
Turn a whole one from a half a brick, look I mastered this
You can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make ya swell up if ya gas get clipped
You can make ya chips swell up, you don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip, like old box-spring
Pissy mattress shit, low old box of things
Strictly glassy shit, I hug the block like quarter water
Shit, I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
Til' like deuce in the morning, with the old heads (uh!)
Slangin' loose quarters, this Philly cat back at it
Still fuckin' with em crack addicts, still bustin' with that black-matic

Guess who's bizack? Back on the block with them O's
Face Mob, Mack Mittens and Hov'
Don't make me relapse, back to the block with the four
Cause this street shit is all I know
(So what you gonna do when you get outta here cat daddy?)
I don't know dawg. I'm just trying to live it one day at a time, ya know?
(I hear you talkin' man, live it one day at a time...)
(It ain't nothing but a thang though, bro)
Yeah I hear you fool...
Well let me get up outta here, my ride out here waitin' for me
(Alright cat daddy, take it easy baby)
You stay up fool
(Peace)

He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly, but glad to be the man's child
The world is different since he's seen it last
Out of jail, been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's letters
Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young, plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally making eighteen
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's calling up his homie who done came up
Livin' lavish, now they dealin' with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth land
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
Now it's different, he done did dirt
And realized killin' men meant comin' up but it still hurt
And can't nobody change this
It's 1994 and we up against the same shit
I never understood why
I could never see a man cry 'til I seen a man die

Imagine life at it's full peak
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this Earth when there's no grief
Imagine grief on this Earth when there's no peace
Everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for souls, then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for your final test
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
How much longer will it be 'til it's all done?
Total darkness at ease be at all one
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
You took his life, but your memory you'll never take
You'll be headed to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face
I still gotta wonder why
I never seen a man cry 'til I seen a man die

I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on
And you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low
Stop trying to fight the reaper, just relax and let it go
Because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try
And you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die
Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal life
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life
Make the choice, let it go if you can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you ready, close your eyes and we can set it free
Here lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace
I still got to wonder why
I never seen a man cry 'til I seen that man die
Everyday it's been the same old thang on my block
You either working or you slanging cocaine on my block
You had to hustle, cause that's how we was raised on my block
And you stayed on your hop until you made you a knot
On my block, to hang out was the thing back then
And even when you left out, you came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Bellfort, to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox, we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On yo' block you prolly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun, or B.I., ya homeboys from knee-high
And even when it was storming outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me, dogg, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was Creepy, if Black June could see me
He'd be tripping - and I'd bet he still try to tease me

My block - where everything is everything for sheezy
My block - we probably done it all homey believe me
My block - we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

On my block, we duck the nigga-haters and the cops
Fuck a IROC, we race Impalas, chromed-out
On my block - it ain't no different than the next block
Ya get drunk and pass out, and they back ya to the house
And when you wake up on the couch you going right back at it
On my block when ya that fucked up they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, making your mark
On my block, we're cuing all the time, playing dominoes
Keep the Swishers sweet down until my Mama goes
Back inside -- then we can fire
Pass it around a few times to get high

My block - where everything is everything for sheezy
My block - we probably done it all homey believe me
My block - we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

On my block, everybody business ain't ya business
What's going on in this house is staying here, comprende?
On my block, ya had to have that understanding
Cause if ya told Ms. Mattie, she went and told Gladys
And once ya mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, they set yo' ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets shell-shocked
Who never quite got right, now they inhale rocks
On my block--it's like the world don't exist
We stay confined to this small little section we living in
Oh my block, I wouldn't trade it for the world
Cause I love these ghetto boys and girls
Born and raised on my block

My block - where everything is everything for sheezy
My block - we probably done it all homey believe me
My block - we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me
Now the funeral is over, and all the tears are dried up
Niggas hanging tape on the cut getting fired up
Looking for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie
An eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me
Look deep into the eyes of your motherfucking killer
I want you to witness your motherfucking murder, nigga
And since you wants to kill then your ass has gots to fry
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slipped I guess you sleep
You sho' nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
Cause where I come from yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rolling through your hood and now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house now your sister's life's in danger (by a total stranger)
With a gang of, niggas wanting to bang you
And hang you, stain you, with one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holaway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standing up for our own shit
And if you outside the clique then you die, bitch
It ain't no love in this motherfucker
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother, uh
Because we real with this shit so we stay true
And since we bang then we do what O.G. say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror so I'm looking at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me
I've got my pistol pawn cocked
Ready to lay shots nonstop until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit you motherfuckers know who run it
So when you put this motherfucker to the test
You gotta realize something nigga
You fucking with the very best
I got this killa up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary
I'm going off on the deep end
I found myself face-to-face with myself while I'm sleeping
I see your picture in my head and my hands shake
You can run, you can hide but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this mutherfucker fore he gets to me
So in your own blood, you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this motherfucker in his fucking grave
And I can say this once again
You can cry but you'll still die
They'll be no tears in the end

Thank you One clear

"In world news today: officials agree that rapper Brad Jordan, alias
Scarface, must be stopped. After being monitored by Secret Service agents for two years, evidence leads Tobacco and Firearms officials to believe that his literally dope lyrics promote drug usage and distribution,degrade women, influence gambling, promote and teach violence. And more importantly it's influencing our minors and destroying our young community. Officials say, he's the lord of underground rap and his music must be stopped."

We got this whole motherfucker on a mission
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they calling on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me
Gangsta Nip, Spice-1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you trying kick some dust up
America's been always known for blaming us niggas for they fuck-ups
And we were always considered evil
Now they trying to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Lets peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled
So why you criticize me
For the shit that you see on your tv
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus: Devin The Dude
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long

So now they trying separation
And sending black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation
Tapping into our conversation
Saying the message that they give
Bring forth or premeditation
So David's got a silver mag
While listening to Brad, David gets pissed and kills his dad
David Duke's got a shotgun
So why you get upset cause I got one
A tisket a tasket
A nigga got his ass kicked
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket
An open and shut situation
Cop gets got, the wanna blame it on my occupation
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me
Because the shit that I be saying ain't worse than no western movie
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus: Devin The Dude
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long

You best to free your mind
Before I free my nine
And stop fucking with Devoid of Pop
Or feel my hot rocks
Bang,bang, boom boom, ping ping I'm the black
White boys got a magazine and don't kow how to act
I'll attack and make you vomit
Down with Khalid Abdul Muhammad
Do he got a brother, I'm it now
I'm the illest
Wanna kill this house nigga Don Cornelius
Can you feel this?
You punk niggas make me sick
Sucking on the devil's dick
Scared of revolution
Need to start douching
Houston is the place
I caught a case
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face
But I bust two times to the gut
Do the Reverend Calvin Butts
Got a pair of nuts?
I started this gangsta shit in '86
Now you dissing me
For publicity
Isn't he a ho to the third degree
Who me
I'm a g who like to scrap-a-lot
Down with Rap-A-Lot
And I can't stop, won't stop
So fuck Bill and Hillary
Ice Cube there ain't no killing me
Ice Cube, Scarface
Dropping on these selling out niggas, doing it like this
Chorus: Devin The Dude
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long
{Verse 1: Scarface}
Man, I met this chick so fine
So bad she made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in The Galleria shopping
Buying gifts for some guy that she dating, still jocking
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs, she started smiling
So I handed her this bathing suit, and told her "Try it"
Replied, "Why?" with light brown eyes
"I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size"
She put it on so I paid for it, and then I told her she could keep it
Then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it: made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I've done it, made mack move with girl chasing me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless, but honey must've missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just humping and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes, she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, it's me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Verse 2: Too $hort}
I called her up on the phone, said "I'll be there in a minute"
'Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all that shit
Every chance you get, you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But everytime I see her got to stop and look
'Cause she so damn fine, bitch
I want to make you mine, bitch
I want to fuck one time, bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind, bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with, stuck with
I love the way she suck dick, and make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't, I knew the bitch would
'Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you know you ain't gon' last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
'Cause It's like that
That's how we do this shit, bitch

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Verse 3: Devin the Dude}
Let me holla at 'cha, B; Short, check this
Just got through fucking this bitch
Who swallowed my cum and drunk my piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or move it
Sucking and fucking, mayne, she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6, nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch, and she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all the time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas, dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me, chewing my nuts like bologna
Then click, she licked on my dick like plop
Then nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said "Look what I got"
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard and rock is what these hoes be missing
And in return, she used a stolen credit card to by me cases
And later on she get this bone and gives me fuck faces

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Verse 4: Tela}
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying it's about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we gon' do is fall through with crushed ice
Man, these hoes been talking 'bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick, it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and it's quiet
The Remy that she give me, and feel me, it's tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties, so damn me, it's in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat-ass eyes
Rochelle who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See, I love these kind 'cause they ain't with that bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl, stop licking right there, you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and feel the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me sit through
Damn hoe, I must admit, that's why I dig you
So I put you to the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex chases
You know what I'm saying, baby? It's either now or never
Too $hort, Tela, Devin, Scarface in style

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
You must be used to all the finer things...
Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen, I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife
I try to give another nigga advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cause this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two?
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid, be one a' your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, detrimental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It's not your enemy who get you
It's always your own people (x5)

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With a loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons in between us, came between us

I know you hate me, don't you
I bet you sit and wish my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well ya'll see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggas start looking at me different than this
And downplay the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But I'mma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against
Nigga you get what you get
Sure the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, well I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggas know I
Don't believe in letting shit slide, nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
With a homeboys demeanor
But let the bullshit come between us

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With a loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons in between us, came between us

Ay this um...
This song right here dedicated to the homie Curtis Davis
We love you home, Big Mello, RIP
Facemob for life
If I had to play God for a day
I would open up the gates, let the world see my face
Remove all doubt from the ones without the faith
And put them on the path of the straight
A safe place, for the young to come out if they want to play
I let their mommas know that they ok
And when y'all pray, I'll respond so you can all see a sign
And answer every pray one at a time
If I'm God huh, all the stabbings all the war would come to cease
My whole entire hood would be at peace, no more beef
And you could sleep without the fears of being woke
By the sounds of sirens, screams of people being smoked
No more dope you don't need it, you'll be cured of all diseases
Your whole entire life would be deleted
Please forgive me I've been dreaming
And rudely interrupted by the demons
Laughed at the picture I was seeing on the ceiling

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face

Just imagine if the devil had a day
And God had took a break and walked away, would you feel safe?
If everything you loved turned into hate
Will the dark angel's evil show you grace
Only to be eaten by a snake, one life one mistake
Be careful of the choices that you make, cause one day
You'll be standing on your feet and then the next
You're underneath the sheet greeting death
I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest
Stealing breath, shortening my days even less
Lost souls never rest, a killer walks the streets seeking flesh
A adolescent hangs she's depressed
A priest who confessed, a judged typing a nigga in a text
Your honor, what the fuck did you expect?
A father kills his son look at life it's a mess
Just imagine what would happen if the lord up and left

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has face

When all that you believed in was a lie
Are you willing to accept it when you find out
Or try to reason with yourself that's what it is when it's not
And all the whole while it's been a plot
To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact
That they keep us in the dark know they act
We react all surprised and not realize that this shit a trap
Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasn't that
The church and these politics they all full of crap
It's a shame but that's how were blaming it's for the scratch
So I don't knock I'm tryna to put a black card in my wallet
But some dollars in my pocket ain't the topic
Y'all need to stop it
This is just crazy these little babies ticking time bombs
Walking around the lunchroom pulling guns
If momma and daddy took the time to raise their son
Then the sister wouldn't be the mom before she twenty-one huh

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has face
Dope sold on the cut make our hands bleed
Fuck broke it ain't an option, penitentiary
Or the grave is the only way we fall back
Do our time A.T.W then crawl back
To them streets where we come from taught life
Look alive know niggas better walk right
Real with it quick trigger finger gun play
I only know how to deal with these niggas one way
And someday I swear to God I'mma change that
But I can't cause them evil demons came back
And when I'm high y'all I can't explain
What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
Cause mane I've been a loyal dude and you can trust that
But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
I need to talk but there ain't no one to listen
Lost inside a mental exorcism
And wishing

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

I woke up from a dream feeling all good
Prayed for better days ahead but what was yall doing
Lost, stuck in a stand still waiting for a hand out
Hustling for tennis shoe paper never panned out
My sister tripping got my grandmother stressing
Cause shes only 17 and shes already pregnant
Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
Bg's is tripping ain't nothing left to stop them
Uncle in jail daddy dead and their mamma's
Can't teach them how to be men; grow up being followers
The streets swallow them then life overpower them
Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
Crash tested a dummy high volume
Only God can judge but y'all niggas is comical
90 percent of our future's off in prison
Prescription for my mental exorcism
And listen

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

Another kid killed in cold blood a mothers heart broke
Family crying on the first few my heart spoke
Hurtful words I would never dare speak
In the house of the lord still I'm in the devils reach
I don't wanna hear the preacher preach that shit a lie
Plus he knowing how that evil be, but who am I
To judge a man when I see him try
FOX news tried to justify him
And ain't no way that you can clarify
In cold blood our lil homies dying
Another sign of the times but it's terrifying
That you could kill us off have us outlined in chalk
Get arrested go to jail go to court and get the fuck off
That shit is fucked off we worried about the money lost
While the clans about to light another cross
I ain't denying it I speak from intuition
It's also from my mental exorcism
And wisdom

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
Yeah
What do you mean, "Where am I at?"
Tss, I'ma call you back

No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my life and
No you can't be my girlfriend

I think if Adam would of had another squeeze he might
Not have ate those fruits from the leaves of life
Far as Eve, there couldn't have been a more deceivin' wife
Seen that Adam had a weak spot and she was right
I just call it how I see it, she in love with him
And he in love too, but still fuckin' all of them
Can you imagine you on lock with one breeze for life?
Wakin' up in the mornin' and layin' down at night
With the same face lookin' at you all the time
Realizin' now that happiness was hard to find
You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face
Plus she's always mad and her sex ain't great
And she don't suck dick like she used to do
Force a nigga into tryna find him somethin' new
And on the real, I done seen it when it went like this
But girl, there's one thing happenin' that you can't forget

No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
No you can't be my girlfriend
And we can get it on and on and on
I'm gone when the sun come again
Can't be my girlfriend
You can't be my, you can't be my

But you can never be my main boo, we can remain cool
But we can't be seen and for this I can blame you
Because you got more miles than a F-350
You been ran through and I know for a fact you got history
But since we met, I've been hearin' your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like a turtle
And you can catch a nigga on the late night
Comin' out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite
And make a man out of him quick 'cause of how you handle the dick
It's unlike no other, she a bad motherfucker
But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover
Make me look fucked up 'cause unlike those others
I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan
So you can't get mad 'cause I am not your man
Your understandin' was bad, it was not my plan
For you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that

No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
No you can't be my girlfriend
And we can get it on and on and on
I'm gone when the sun come again
Can't be my girlfriend
You can't be my, you can't be my

For me to say that, "I do," would be a lie 'cause I don't
Believe no woman is right for me so I won't
Try to talk myself into thinkin' she is
And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch
And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man
But for every one woman, there's a man, home man
Sayin', "Damn, I done spent six years in this shit
The first two was cool and then the bitch just flipped"
And then that's it, had to make some new plans
'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man
Now you're hurt all alone, steady hittin' her phone
But a bigger whip and longer bankroll, she gone
And if I ever say, "Maybe," and you thought that I might
You consider, just imagine what my wife was like
And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own
And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone

No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
No you can't be my girlfriend
And we can get it on and on and on
I'm gone when the sun come again
Can't be my girlfriend
You can't be my, you can't be my girl

Sorry baby
Cos I ain't ever change on you motherfuckers
And OG's spitting game on you motherfuckers
You should be ashamed like a motherfucker
The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers
Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You won't find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper

These youngsters think that I'm so cool
They wanna learn the game from an old school
I give em strategies to sleep on
So when they put me in the grave they could keep on
Now first on your check list
Be your own man cos your friends ain't shit
They only come around when they need to
Use that home boy shit to deceive you
Remember you don't owe nobody, niggas
Niggas put the bite to the hand that feeds, that’s your body
And they forgetting how they got there
This is life, it's a game, but it's not fair
It's hard enough trynna get by
Day to day struggling with shit so you get high
And staying drunk on the regular
Talking dope talk on your cellular
But in this game that's a no-no
The streets ain't the only ones watching, taking photos
And life ain't bitches and money
This life's bout getting this money
Because that bitch is a problem
Can't live with and can't live without her
My advice to you is stay on your grind
Keep that bitch on her back and your bank on your mind, nigga


And we don't talk to police
That's the number one rule on the streets
Cause if you can't do the time, then you don't do the crime
Nigga keep the streets quiet
You don't upstrap unless you have to
Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
You gon' revenge somebody?
Dig two graves, just in case it's two bodies
And never bring a stick to a gunfight
One shot, one kill, you get one life
And shitting where you sleep ain't an option
People knowing where you sleep, that's a problem
You got to watch these niggas
They ain't your home boys, not these niggas
First chance you call sleep, they could murk you
So don't put squares in your circle
Cos these streets don't love nobody
You gotta pay attention to the signs, Johnny
If you a weak nigga, don't try to play hard
Better keep your punk ass out the yard


And don't get fronted, just avoid that
But if you have to, pay them boys back
Cos niggas ain't playing, it's a drought
The border is closed, the cash running out
And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks
Every nigga in the way getting shook
You got to play the game by the book
I fuck around and your life getting took
And last but not least, when you make that money
Keep it low-pro, don't say shit, dummy
And don't say shit to your girlfriend
Pillow talk will send your ass to the state pen
Take notes to the game I'm providing
Stop using momma names trynna hide shit
Nigga them feds ain't stupid
You ain't the only nigga trynna do this
Riding round the hood in a four-door
Flying spur ol' rims, trynna showboat
You drawing too much attention
And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
But once you in it, it's hard to get out of
And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do
So when you get the chance to make a break for it, run fool
Staring down the barrel of a Colt .45
I'm feeling mad suicidal, so I think I'm gonna drive
Everything is hazy and I can't see my lanes
Demons got me seeing double in the rain
If I put the pedal to the metal, take my hands off the wheel
Lord if you hear me, steer, steer
Lord if you hear me, steer

I think I need to breathe cuz I ain't feeling right
My conscience is at ease saying live your life
Got everything I ain't missin' much, bruh
Got my little paper back I ain't feeling fucked up
My woman got my back so I ain't stressed out
Side looking in, you can say I’m blessed huh
Career still intact got my street cred
Went on with life thinking that the beef’s dead
But every now and then I get flash backs
Get down on my knees and I ask that
God keep my head on cuz I dont wanna spaz out
Load back up that 45 and air a nigga, ass out

Staring down the barrel of a Colt .45
I'm feeling mad suicidal, so I think I'm gonna drive
Everything is hazy and I can't see my lanes
Demons got me seeing double in the rain
If I put the pedal to the metal, take my hands of the wheel
Lord if you hear me, steer, steer
Lord if you hear me, steer

Awaken by the sound of the siren
Helicopter spotlights illuminate the crime scene
Crowd gathers round try to find out what the fuck just happened
Wait a minute, time out
I looked a little closer at my t-shirt
I see squirts of blood just now starting to bleed worse
I'm lost I got blood on my hands, though
And then the camera man starts to pan slow
Realizing what I'm up against
I guess I just have to face the consequence
Snap back to reality
I gotta think fast, got some motherfuckers after me


Paranoid, got me running for my life now
Homicide, questioning my mama and my wife now
Parking lot, full of cops, got the dogs out
Running, chest burning, out of breath
About to fall out
Hit the corner, parked car at the stop sign
Going back to jail ain't the plan so the outline
Is to come up with something so I escape this or hand cuffs
Fuck that I ain't gonna take shit
I rather be carried by 6 than judged by 12 getting that cell
Or maybe they gon' gun a nigga down
Cause they don't wanna see me in the trial

Everything is hazy and I can't see my lanes
Demons got me seeing double in the rain
If I put the pedal to the metal, take my hands of the wheel
Lord if you hear me, steer, steer
Lord if you hear me, steer
Ghetto niggas remain violent while the killers remain silent
Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all warrin'
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggas do they struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons died in
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
It's the nigga that makes music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets
Cause it's deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't surface
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
Who done came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it loves me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggas

This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas

'Face, imagine us working at McDonald's
To me and you, selling fucking, tapes to the Bahamas
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggas
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No Limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on red beans the size of some bullets, huh
We ghetto niggas can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little J down at Rap-A-Lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggas off from New Orleans to California
Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh)
Independent, black owned got 'em hooked on this cocaine
You used to see CEO’s in suits and ties
But we young niggas in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be 'bout it 'bout 'til we gray in the wheel chair

This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas

What do you get from boosting?
Niggas coming out to California, and represent them niggas from
Houston
And now 2Pac ll keep this shit popping
And all my niggas across the Bay, know L.A., keep the shit hot
I keep a Glock inside my pants , don't give Locaz a chance
Put me inside a casket, you dirty bastards
Until the day I die, you catch a nigga high off weed, the police can't
Find me
My shit will drop and I'll sell five million
While all the niggas enter the game, they caught up in drug dealing
Now how can I fall? how can I ball, how can I catch my enemies and murder 'em all?
My words of flame, burn niggas inside their brain
Niggas can't hang with me, and nuttin's changes, uh
Scarface got me on this shit
We lace heat, motherfuckers in they body and face, uh
Growing thicker, liquor, maybe ya daddy a nigga
Niggas don't wanna see me worldwide, mob figure
M.O.B., Hennessy keep me g'd and
Keyed niggas, don’t wanna see me, when I got weed, in my system
Catch another victim, capture bodies
Bring a shottie to the fucking party, yeah
I party all night
I do this shit cause it's wrong but we born right
And to these niggas in my zone, we do it long ways
'til these bitches understand nigga my song pays; cause I'm the man
Now these are my homeboys, we outlaws 'til the day we die
Keep this shit, rough and raw
My 45, make sho', that I survived, to another day
Just bust rhymes, and brothers get paid
Now that's the end of my freestyle, but it was laced with game
Buy my shit and you can hear it plain, West Side!

This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas
I am ghetto, boy, chillin'
Represent for the niggas in the hood and how they livin'
Heavy metal concealin'
Hustlin' 'til you touch a 9 to 5 of drug dealin'
It don't matter how I get it, I got it, fuck feelings
I don't have none, I'm 'bout my paper, nigga, ask 'em
Don't get confused on how the cash come
Never, by any means necessary better
Get up off your ass and get my money 'fore I stretch yah
Out in front your doorstep, when I brandish this .45th
You can make arrangements, you a dead man, a ghost
See I come from them cuts for real
Much long before this rap came, fuck the deal
I survived the game of life, nigga, fuck some skills
Crossin' me, get in the way, this pussy must get killed
I'm alive, he came, he bust 'til he left
I would have made for sure I was dead and fuck yourself
Yeah, cause now I'm at his ass with a vengeance
Blood in, blood out from the beginning to the ending
Real shit bein' spit, know your limits
It's best you mind your mothafuckin' business
If you ain't in it

So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin', no, eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle 'til I see the dirt
Riskin' 25 years just to see another first

I was all alone, car full of niggas
How'd I get here? Car full of hittas
I was rollin' weed, they was snortin' blow
Such a cool breeze, heart so cold
Step up to the plate, where your money at?
Bobby Brown on cake with a hundred packs
New editions, Lisa Lisa
We were secret lovers, had to get a beeper
My Atlantic star, not a Notre Dame
Not a student loan, tried to motivate
Continental, my Bentley, this shit should be illegal
Selassie eye in the ghost, thousand bales of that diesel
Lord, go toe to toe with any pussy boy
Fuck, one time for Face and all the Boobie boys
26 inch plates on a 68
Where I'm from a half a key'll set a nigga straight
I just wanna make the car notes
Let mama make the pot roast
You should meet me at the car wash
Washin' all 8, that's inshallah

So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle 'til I see the dirt
Riskin' 25 years just to see another verse

Speakin' for those squeakin' in them cell blocks readin'
To blacks, whites and Puerto Ricans
Brothers with those ankle bracelets, impatient for their releasin'
To make it back to the block, the hatred, the present
Time sure flies, look how many years went by
My young niggas already need hair dye
Alcoholic faces, women bad as a mug
Gettin' fat as fuck
Fried food be addin' up, the system thrives off its victims
They ask how this economic collapse
Can affect people all over the map
Tea party for tax reenactment is whack
The past the past, yo, to my vatos out in the East Los
Nietas on the east coast, shouts to Puerto Rico
Dominican Republic people, rep I
Brown and black, we must get it together
The prison industrial complex a fuckin' set up
The Aztec, Olmec, African settled on this land from the get up
I changed my aim, who I'm gon' wet up
When violence is resorted, knowledge is distorted
Unless it's payback for brutality
I'm more or less with that, get back

So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle 'til I see the dirt
Riskin' 25 years just to see another verse
Mr. Mr. Scarface been walking down the block
Out jumps some fiends and steals all his rocks
Pulls out a gun and shoots down all the fiends
And Mr. Mr. Scarface went up the block again

All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have, all I have, all I have in this world

Ahh yeah, hah
Mr. Scarface is back in the motherfuckin house once again!
Yea, droppin some of that new
Mr. Scarface Two, on your motherfuckin ass
So suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
Or something, bitch

I don't give a fuck about the chatter in the background
Niggas get beat when they step this is Ak's town
If you don't know, I recommend you check
And ask them motherfuckers how many heads I put to rest
I play a game but the game ain't roulette
Slangin 'caine is the thang and I bet
That there's a lot of wannabe Scarfaces
I've heard the name in ninety-nine different places
I'm here to squash it all original will speak
Scarface on your ass from the streets
I left my cut, in fear of a prison term
They wanna put me in a chair and let me burn
But go to prison on a murder rap, fuck that
I refuse to be a visitor in state's camp
So I broke and left behind all I worked for
Either that or be sentenced for a drug war
And many want to know why I've slowed up
It's either that or get fucked
Cause laws get happy on the trigger
Say fuck it put a cap in a nigga
But this ass ain't made for no caps, homie
This ass says 'Exit Only'
So I get in the wind but hey
A nigga still sold a quarter everyday
I sat around for six months black
Waitin for the day to make a comeback
And now I'm ready for combat
Mr. Scarface is back

All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the for-reala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the for-reala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world

Aiyo Bido, drop that shit
Yeah, heh heh
Back in the South Park, six o'clock on the dot
Checkin on my old rock spot
I seen the same old set
Heh, the small timers see me so they jet
Buildin' 128
I got myself a bag and I can't wait
To cut em up small to make a profit
Niggas on the cut short stop it
Fiends'll see em small then they go
Where, to see the motherfuckin' pro
One nigga got pissed
And started reachin' for his shit
.357 on your ass, fool
Like I said before, you don't get a second chance dude
Unloaded on his ass, he was hurt
Six shots put his dick in the dirt
Laid him out like a motherfuckin' rug
Gettin' pumped full of .38 slugs
Some other niggas stepped out y'all
Aw shit, I had to make a phone call

J. Prince: Hello?
Scarface: Hey J!
J. Prince: Wassup?
Scarface: I'm in a little trouble man
J. Prince: Where you at?
Scarface: I'm out here in South Park Village
J. Prince: Stay right there, I'll be right on
Scarface: C'mon let's take these motherfuckers to war man

J called up some niggas from the 5th Ward
And came back with a motherfuckin hit squad
Motherfuckin Uzi machine
Big Chief packed an M-16
Will an AK with a banana clip
And little Bill had a god damn pistol grip
I hit a little laugh and got me a buzz
And that's about the time they got drugged
One more war took place
You can call me the shit starter, or call me Mr. Scarface

All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the for-reala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the for-reala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world

Damn, check this shit out
Later on, all alone, you know what happened next
Another bitch came by to give me sex
It was kind of strange I was thrown off
The last bitch got her head blown off
But fuck I ain'tsta pass up no putty
She started strippin' at the door, oh goody
I got in that ass with the quickness
Fuckin her down with the diznick
I didn't have to pretend I loved her
All she wanted me to do was just fuck her
So I gave it up to the lady
And all she said was "Fuck me baby, fuck me baby"
I started stroking in an outrage
The whole while I was starin' at my twelve gauge
The bitch was makin noise I said I'm killin her
And all the while my dick was hard and he was still in her
I made a nut as she fell to the floor
I heard a knock on the front door
I grabbed the twelve gauge from the bed head
Who is it? (Fred) Who?
Who the fuck is Fred, I stood by the door
By that time someone jumped in the window
Now what the fuck was I do?
The bitch packed a twenty-two
Hit him in his head, there she laid him
The nigga standin' by the door I sprayed him
And headed for the back
I seen that same old brown Cadillac
It kinda fucked me up at first
Cause the nigga that drove that Caddy rode away in a hearse
I opened up fire on the ride G
Who I was shootin for was standin right behind me
I had a double barrel pointed at my ass
Could this be the end of Mr. Brad?
I don't know what happened to the slut
Well that's about the time the closet door it opened up
(On your ass trick!
I'll be damned if I go out like the last bitch!)
Heh, five-0's on my ass man
They know me by the face, but they don't know my last name
Now I'm back on the case
Yeah, just call me Mr. Scarface
(Scarface whispering):
I don't really remember feeling like this
Got this love formin' in my life-for this dame
And indeed took the form of life-and that's a shame
How a man can fall in love with dreams--not afraid
Not afraid to let you up and leave
Do your thang MaryJane mess with all my folks-got 'em high
For the days that they were lost and broke-shit got 'em by
Only right we stop and give her props
Plus she from the block of only finer crops
Do your thang MaryJane
Chorus:
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
Do your than MaryJane
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
When the world starts to stress you out-what you do?
Put a cancer stick up in your mouth-or grab a brew
Sold in stores but the fact remains is-they the blame
And the government's been taxin' that (   )-- gettin' paid
If it's taxable it's cool to smoke--kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks- true or not
Other people try to make you bad--but I know you not
When my situation's lookin' sad I know I got
A true friend in my time of need-all I need
Your natural you come from seeds-I decree
Makes me happy when I'm feelin' pain
Once again makes me happy just to hear your name
Do your thang MaryJane
Chorus:
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
MaryJane do your thang
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
When you sad depressed and feeling strange-who you blame
Need some company to keep you sane-call her name
MaryJane I love you MaryJane-do your thang
You're all I need to get me through this thang-true to game
You ain't never made me smash my thangs-scratch the brain
Anything you've always kept me tame-and its plain
For me to see that you my everything-MaryJane
MaryJane helps to ease the brain-when you hang
Through the seasons you ain't never change-stayed the same
Never seen what people seen in speed-you became
Naturally you everything we need-do the thang
Do your thang baby true indeed
Do your thang MaryJane
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
MaryJane do your thang
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And fuck the baddest hoes that your ass can find
One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
Four of the finest hoes that your ass can find

Sittin' at the stoplight, looking at hoes
Peeping out this bitch in her black Girbauds
Windows rolled up tight, top was closed
Blowing Swisher Sweet smoke out my nose
Open up the door and asked the bitch, "What's up?"
Lookin' at me crazy, I'm like, "Bitch what's up?"
She asked about my woman, I said "My woman at home"
I asked about her nigga, she said her nigga was gone
I got my pencil and got the digits and things
And after three or four days, I gave that bitch a ring
We started talking and I dropped some shit
Gave her some game and now I got that bitch
Now she wants to give your homie some ass
But it's just one question I got to ask
Can you...

One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the finest bitches that your ass can find
Can you, one (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the finest bitches that your ass can find

I called my homie, told my homie "It's on"
Gotta few hoes that wanna moan and groan
They on they way I just hung up the phone
And we gon' be like Marvin Gaye, nigga, gettin' it on
But you gots to keep your head right
And make these bitches feel at home
'Cause these bitches got they head tight
And furthermore, they bringin' weed
Just kick back, nigga, follow my lead

One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the finest hoes that your ass can find
One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the finest bitches that your ass can find

Hung up the horn and the hoes arrived
Three tight young tenders, them hoes was live
Rolled herself a woola, told her "Fade me, troop"
Cock bustin' at the seams of her Daisy Dukes
Ass fatter than a motherfuckin' quarter horse
Ready to take one of these bitches to the slaughterhouse
Got my shirt over my dick 'cause it's hardened to fuck
Hoes eyes getting red, now they wantin' to fuck
It's about time to put the game in attack
Tapped her, told her bring "ol' what's her name" in the back
Got 'em in my room, about to hop in the tub
My homie walked in, "Show your partna some love"
Told my homie put it down, we finna act a fool
The ho said, "Cool, hop yo ass in the pool
I wanna polish up your tool"
But it's just one thing before you do
Can you...

One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the fattest Swishers that your ass can find
Can you, one (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the fattest Swishers that your ass can find
Can you, one (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the fattest Swishers that your ass can find
Can you, one (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
Act a fool...uh!
...It's a new day... ya know what I'm sayin'?
A new day, brings a new problem to a brother
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
Cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke
Either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
And with his help, my mother made a man of me
Didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in
Taught me how to save my little dividends
So when I graduated I'd have a little school money
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
And flunked outta school with the flag pole
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
Cause we was alone, and me I bought an F home
My real pops he broke out with the style
So I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child
So now we livin' comftable
Taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldn't see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'
And ended up in a big fight
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now I'm livin' in my grandma's home
My grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own
And keepin' me ain't no big deal
But now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels
Being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke
And now the money's low
And pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go
Or either try to find a job so I can help out
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
So my family can have a better place to stay
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope
And now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong
She just prayin' for me heavily
Take care of her grandson
And the lord must of heard her prayer
Cause he made me get a grip
And got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...
I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun
My baby's mother just had my first son
May eleven, I never will forget the day
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface
My first born and yo I'm a proud father
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father
And sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead
But what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk, and pampers tryin ta do my part
And he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes, and jewellry not the Tonka toys
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
And I don't want my son to look at life
Through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like
But yet and still I let my son be a kid
Just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
And now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role
Because these years he'll remember most
So it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close
But I got a buncha obstacles
If it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybody's got my baby
Wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy
"It's your daughter, don't she look like you?"
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do
Because my mother knows the real deal
All these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal
So now we in and outta cope
Tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me
Now eveybody knows, that she was just fakin' G
Come to find out, the girl never had me
She's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy
And biological tests can prove
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
But now I finally got a real daughter
No need for the testin'
I know that I'm the baby's father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...
I feel ya...
Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife
And got a bigger stick to fight with
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick
Because we livin' in a concentration set
And everyday, we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
And judgement day is just somethin we can't run from
So I know my number's comin' up
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up
And even though I hate killin' off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine
My brother Quanell's tryin' to keep the neighbourhood at peace
Don't fight each other, we gots ta stand and fight the beast
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
Because we always tryin to take another brother's shit
And the cops is in the same vote
Just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
And now the story's all twisted up
And if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldn't give a fuck
Because she left my partner's family with memories
And after hearin' this I know you gon' remember me
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up
Because I know what you did was wrong
But you won't realize until you dead and gone
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning
You straight up shot him from behind
But all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back
You give a gat to a black he don't know how to act
But you gotta tell your story to the judge
Not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
Then in reality you took care of your business
But regardless I know you wanna kill me
But I ain't goin' out like dat
Ya feel me?
...yeah

I sit alone in my four cornered room starin' at candles
Are we on the radio dukes?
Awww yeah, give it to me

Yeah, at night I can't sleep
I'm tossin' and turnin'
I still got the candlesticks burnin'
It ain't changed but it's a different time
And I'm still playin' tricks with my mind
My mothers always stressin' that I'm livin' wrong
But I got my Smith and Wesson cause I'm gettin' grown
And their lookin' at your little boys success
And I been thinkin', I'm dealin' with too much stress
So I stay up on my p's and q's
And watch out for the G's and fools
Cause the homies that I thought I had
See me stackin' up a grip
And they just started talkin' bad
So I stay away from outsiders
And when I roll through, it makes 'em open they mouth wider
I used to think that you was my one and only homie
My mind was playin' tricks on me

My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me

Yeah
Dear diary I'm havin' a little problem with my mind state
How many bullets would it take to change my mind? wait
Sometimes I want to end it but I don't though
They tell me see my pastor but I don't go
Cause they all be on this one street
So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
And give my money to the most needy
And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
Cause their puttin' a price tag on a man's word
And it's a fashion show, so the men flirt
The world is endin' so they try to make us switch fast
And they openin' up these churches for some quick cash
And usin' the money fo' they new cribs
While brother Johnson just got kicked out where he lived
I follow no man, cause man be phoney
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't seem to keep my mind on a steady track
I'm all about gettin' mine so I study that
But it seems they want to get me
So I try to keep my nine millimeter wit me
Just in case they want to see a homies head blown
But I got to stay around to see my kids grown
I finally found a woman who could deal wit me
Back then I had a woman who wouldn't real wit me
And now she's back with her old lady
And now I got it goin' on and they sure hate me
Now I'm a gone and she's alone
Hahahaha, her mind was playin' tricks on her
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
Bringin' it back like this here
1-9-9-1 all the way to the 1-9-9-4 and they call me 'Face
My mind was playin' tricks on me
You know they always say, man, it's tough being at the top, huh?
I couldn't agree with you more
Jealous hearted motherfucker
Never been able to fuck with me nigga, ever
Super solid from day one
Never put myself in a compromised position, I'm a chess player
And if I did... I'd just shoot my way out

First born to my momma
I come from the place where you're promised
To die before your 21st
You'll be surprised what's underneath the earth
Dug dirt, I put bones there
All my enemies is gone now
I can't sleep through the cold sweats
Flashbacks, I'm a known threat
God fearing yet I'm evil though
I think deep, I believe in ghosts
Ever felt the hand of a dead body?
Then you know why I took my gun and head-shot him
War started over dope cuts
I put what I live by on both nuts
It's either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU!

Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long
My M.O. is like "fuck you!"
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
I'ma reach out and touch you
I ain't gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

I live like I spit it
Raised by the wolves so my mentality is "get it"
A life on the streets takes commitment
The power that you gain gets addictive
The money being made gets you bitches
A real nigga played the game like it's business
A weak nigga facing time, go to snitching
Plotting on his whole team 'cause he ain't wanna listen
If it was all good just a week ago
Take your motherfucking charge, that's your key of dope
We all wanna eat, gotta feed folks
Took an oath on the streets called a G code
That's what we live by, die for it
I got homies standing firm doing time for it
We have five-K-one's, gun killers
 bust that nigga, fuck that nigga!

Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long
My M.O. is like "fuck you!"
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
I'ma reach out and touch you
I ain't gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

They jealous of me cause I shine bright
Grind strong plus my mind right
My gun loaded up in both clips
Jump out on me wrong and meet the four fifth
No shit, this is music you can drive-by
G's the only code we abide by
Blunt burning in the ashtray
Playing faggot games and now your ass chafe
Niggas wearing tight pants and high heels
Claiming another nigga's hood that is not real
I am still the hardest nigga being heard
Fuck he claiming he real when he ain't keep his word?
He ain't fooling me, my nigga, he is just a nerd
Nothing but a rap tune, he ain't seen a bird, word
I talk that shit that I can back, though
Cause that's in my boxing game, I'm in the back, hoe
Talk that big six but pack a double blank
You where trouble ain't
Just another saint, fuck 'em!
If this is love I don't see it
Can't make me believe it
You a nice girl, but I'm a hood nigga on some street shit
And yeah, you know my weakness
Sucker for some love type
I come from the slums girl, you come from a good life
I wonder what you see in me
I love weed and Hennessy
You barely doing happy hour, I ain't never seen you drink
And now that's leaving me to think, how I got so close to you?
This was just a hit and split, that's what I supposed to do
One thing let up to the next, I'm addicted to your sex
You addicted to this dick, every cause has its effect
That's what I get I guess, I can't commit that's killing this
You gave me an ultimatum, I'm numb I ain't feeling shit
Must not know who she dealing with
Puddles on her pillow case, tears running, eyeline, lipstick smeared
Hey are you ok?
You disobey, you pay for that
Well, the love is gone, and she ain't made it back, pray for that

What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
(skit: Scarface/woman)
I'm just sayin', a relationship should be 100-100 not 50-50, right?
Right
Oh what you gon' think about that?
Yeah I'm gon' think about that
Look, you want me here or not?

Think before you answer that, it's hard enough we breaking up
But after this no turning back, brought this on myself with her
Mistakes I'm forced to live with that, I'm knowing more mistakes to come
I'm human, that's my best excuse, in fact my only one
Tears fall, my kids call, 'This ain't me, it's his fault'
Oh shit no, we did this
A partnership with no room for forgiveness
I take the blame, take your aim
Shoot that shot, can't wait to claim
All of this, in Jesus name
Pray in church, they give you change
I feel your pain
Songs sung in the key of life, with no meaning right
Hopefully one day might come I'd see the light
Can't sleep at night
And I'm wondering who's fooling who?
I'm sure you know who's fucking me, cause I know who's been fucking you
We used to be inseparable, never thought that that day would come
Where I'd take that shit so serious, and you get so good at playing dumb, you got away with one

What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'

You had me I'll admit that, fell into the trap you set
Lookin' me in my eyes, lyin', killing me with that soaking wet
Wouldn't let me meet your connect
Scratching me all across my face
Says she loves the way it feels when I'm in it all the way
60 calls a day, wondering where the fuck I'm at
Wondering where the fuck I stay, who else I fuck like that
Now let's be honest, you got him with whom you made your promise
And let us not forget, it's her with whom I made my woman
I know our days are numbered, enjoying moments after
Plus in lust we fell in love, the pains are more than laughter
Living our separate lives, are husbands reckless why?
Beneath the questions lie, why was she left to cry?
Should have left shit quiet, but you was out of line
Better step aside, gotta tell me why?
I was everything, you was all I had
Now this is change, and then this change is bad
Make a note of that

What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
Greatest ever done it, you can learn from it
Dope game; ran it - rap game; run it
Street cred hundred, nerd turned D-boy
Naughty genetic make-up, baby, I'm a G-boy
Hashtag street-boy, wrong one to fuck with
Cross me at your own risk, play to get back, you can trust this
I am far from average, to me it ain't no such thing
Me against the world so fuck it I let my nuts hang
I've been known to bust bang, Kíli of the NEB
I don't need an army when the smoke clears, he sees me
Rhyming at its finest unlike those vaginas
They claim that they the real deal knowing I'm the highest
Time for the command chain, I am what the streets made
I am what the hood built, you are just a weakling
Homocidal maniac with suicidal tendencies
You're more like a punk band, I'm more like a pedigree
Nigga, you ain't seen yet so y'all can not describe me
I'm a freak of nature, Don't shit here suprise me
Money over everything except a nigga's manhood
I am not a prostitute, you don't understand hood
Fuck a nigga getting his unless he 'bout to give me mine
Otherwise he prime beef, shocking when I up the nine
And hit him with it several times, fuck you thought I was civilized?
Welcome to the jungle, fool, it's only right I punish you
Nigga with an attitude, feel like MC Ren felt
Quiet on the set, you funky bitch, you get your friend slept
I'll give your gang a black eye, blame it on the black God
I be on some nigga shit, I'm nigga rich so that's why
Guess what my religion is, this is what the business is
Expose you for your garbage ass rappers, you can witness this
Came to bang the game up, pussies think they came up
Oh, you got a drophead? So now you think you're famous?
Out here it's dangerous, if we don't know your name cuz
We don't even give a fuck, rappers get it fucked up
Security save you? Nah, it's their side job
They don't want no conflict, they don't want no problem
Nah
(riiinnnngggg) "Don't answer that"
"Hello, I'm not at home, leave a message (beep)
"Yo, bitch, this is (beep) pick up the phone, bitch
I know you're in there
You fucking with that old fucking ass 'Face now, huh bitch
Where my motherfucking kids at, bitch
Fucking bitch, punk ass bitch!"

Hey, today must be my lucky day
I turned the corner, hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away
(now where's she staying?) she must be new in the hood
But I ain't trippin' on that shit, cause it's all good
I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name
Ain't a damn thing changed, ain't no shame in my game
She said, " Used to go Thomas"
I slowed my roll, cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas
Now where your man at, she said "Gone at work"
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinkin', "Go on and flirt"
My homies women ain't no thing to me
Cause if they caught one of my ho's, they'd do the same to me
And furthermore, she was peepin' my ride
Convertible, 64, with the ride inside
Super clean with the discs and vogues
Higher than a fuck spittin' this to hoes:

Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight

Reminiscing on the bitch that I had back in the day
Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face
Now that's the breaks
She didn't have to put up a front
I stuck that ass back in there
And haven't called her for 3 months
I guess it's in me to be doggin' a chic
Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master
Let her take a ride with the Bradster
It cool, don't front ..ooooh, no sex
No sweat-not even on my mind-we just met
And furthermore, we can get to those
But for now, I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to hoes:

Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight

Now I'm cruisin' to the crib with this bitch that I scooped
Parked my Ferrari, now I'm back in the coup
I knocked her boots - your baby's mama put me to work
I tagged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt
She wanted me badly so I put it inside
She got the (front, back, and side to side)
Back and forth with the gangster glide
Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9
Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the Knicks
Now she's asleep, cause she just had her drawers full of dick
(now that's sick) and plus she got you staying at home
With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on
So believe me when you downin' the Brad
I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass
So player hatin' niggas check the bitch you chose
I'll be mobbing in my 'Benz spitting this to ho's:

Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight
There's gonna be some shit you might not understand
But, you may have to rewind this shit a few times
Heaven, heaven
Check it out
I know tomorrow ain't a promise
That's why I live one day at a time
So when it's my turn, there'll be no crying
I'm aware that when my number's called I'm punching the clock
No need for screaming at me momma, I'm out
And plus I wasn't really happy here to start with, let that be told
My own homeboy was robbing me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, cause 2 don't count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is scheming?
And every other corner, you're passing a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm remembering this
Your families your backbone, your friends ain't shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was saying "Back in the days..."
When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl, everybody's saying
(Chorus)
My angel
My sunshine
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
My best friend
My good time
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
Listen to different scriptures, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religion, this shit's ain't no song
I'm hearing niggas makin' up scriptures, and playing along
Probably saying I'm the hypocrite, for judging these folks
But you can tell he ain't a Christian, by the way that he spoke
I pray for everybody, hoping that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down, boy
When you're aware of your surroundings, yet you still can't move
Water shooting outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder, than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Gon' change your life when you hear it
And the next morn', you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener, and the sun brighter
I know the feeling first hand, I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life
And it was like (heaven, heaven...)
But I'm a man, I ain't perfect
That's a poor excuse, that ain't working
I asked him for forgiveness, for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
And trying and get to heaven...
America the Beautiful, don't be so cold
How do you expecting our seeds gonna grow?
When you trap us in the ghetto
And show love, to the other motherfuckers
While we right here starvin' at home
I'd cry, if I thought, that me sheddin' a tear might help
Then again, me sheddin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the President, and see if he know help
Let him know you up shit creek yourself, we all sinners
Facin' the winter, with no socks, and no shoes
In a position, where we all gon' loose
Instead of penitentiaries, we gon' need more schools
Or what the fuck is we gonna do?
Sit around and let the world pass us by?
Waitin' on a message from the reverend
And he ain't but another man, tryin' to get to (heaven...)

You was playin' when you was sayin' you was ready
I'm knowin' you ain't mean it when you told me you was tired of life
And just wanted to leave it you was drinkin'
So I ain't really pay it no attention
Took you back to your crib and dropped you off
With the intention of gettin' with this Asian bitch
I’ve been off in Visionz, somethin' exquisite
I had to spit that game, she was vicious
I'm hoppin' back on 6-10 punchin' the drop
On my way out to her house I started noticing cops
Somethin' tellin' me to turn around and follow these dudes
Normally I wouldn't consider but out of the blue I'm bustin' a U
I get off where they get off at
Well-familiar with these streets, this where I came up at
Roadblocks, yellow tape, "a crime scene" they say
What the fuck just happened? I just left this place...
I get out and started walkin' askin' Frog, "What's up?"
Lookin' at me dazed like, "Face, it's all fucked up..."
I move a little closer tryin' to see who it is
And I saw his baby mama in tears holdin' his kids...

I ain't﻿ whole in the inside I'm hurting I can't explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies I'm knowing this ain't how my life's supposed to be

And it was then it finally hit me
I'm standing here nervous as I can be
It was nothing that can prepare me for what I'm finna see
I'm praying this is a dream and I'm bout to awake
But the closer I got the more I realize fate
Wasn't fair to change for me
And why would I think so
My homie had a date with death
He had to make though
I'm feelin' eerie, I'm liftin' up the yellow tape
By the time I get to the scene
They rollin' this away
I wonder whats under this sheet, my knees get weak
To the point I had to take me a seat
This shit's deep
When they put a nigga down that you was raised around
What was once a minor statement's turnin' major now
Never woulda thought in years that my homie was suicidal
Had it all; money and kids and a wife that read the bible
They say it's life and death in the slum
He had his reasons I shoulda believed him
Anotha soul no longer breathin'
Hate to say it but this one been heavy on my conscience
My nonchalantness just took a life over some nonsense

I ain't﻿ whole in the inside I'm hurting I can't explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies I'm knowing this ain't how my life's supposed to be

And everybody thinkin' it's murder, but homicide sayin' self-inflicted
By the way the body was sitting, brains in the kitchen
Who coulda predicted
But the detectives who was fishin'
Fucked up that the family had to see dad in his position
All I remember was us doin' what we did
To survive in these streets where we lived
We was kids growin' up in this environment
Nothing but trouble
You either struggled or you hustled
Folded the bubble
Grade school til we dropped out, we had a plan
We was either finna be rich or die like a man
We did it all for the love of the hood, every journey
Imagine seein' your dawg lifeless across a gurney
I wonder what was goin' on
You shoulda said that you was feelin' mad
I coulda talked you outta that
But never will I see you again
Nor will your kids
Nor will your family or your friends
It's the end
Not even words I write in this song
Can right that wrong
My nigga is gone and life goes on

I ain't﻿ whole in the inside I'm hurting I can't explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies I'm knowing this ain't how my life's supposed to be
I started small time, dope game, pushin on the corner
Twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you want 'em
Full of formaldehyde, my clothes wreakin marijuana
Cops rollin up on us, my neighborhood's like a sauna
Pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us
But if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
I ain't playin no games, I'm on a mission fo' the change
Motherfuck being a lame, I'm ten toes in the game - deep
I can't slip, this whole world want me sleep
See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin for keeps, 'cause see, it's a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin his and me gettin mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
And anybody standin' in the way of that is dyin'
I bust nine—how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me

One wrong move, and I'ma have to leave you for the goons
Catch you slippin asleep in your bedroom and then (Explosion)
Get you Audi, now what the fuck was this dude thinkin?
You can cheat the rules of the streets, and not leave stinkin?

I can squeeze without blinkin, I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta

I got a brick from a sucker that he wanted to move
But the whole while I'm cookin I'm like, "Fuck this dude"
It's on, thirty-six zones of my own
Keep the money fo' myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone, "Ay", I just got knocked
And the cops was askin bout you, come get me hot
Never showed, so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme, steppin on the dope
It's cold, but that's it, I'm on it like I want it
And twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
That means I'm on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break 'em off a couple of C, and double up they fee
Takin over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
And when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block
And if they wanna ride for they corners we ride right with 'em
Dummy move, whole thing, the goon squad get 'em


No mo' petty rock hustlin, I'm in for the run
And I'm fo'sho I'm gon' be murdered for this shit that I done
But I'mma die standin up cause I'm a stand up nigga
Fuck dyin like a bitch on my knees, I'm a killer
So don't nobody cry cause I was destined to get it
Just remember, I'm the one who took the dope game and flipped it
And pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
Of me seein first motherfuckin light of the day
A trigger man, deadly as fuck with a loaded AK
Spot my enemy and kill him the American way
I turned a dream into reality, with a fuck you mentality
Silencin all these niggas in the neighborhood who challenged me
Family grievin from they loved one's mortality
He ain't got a reason to die then kill him, it's a tragedy

Right?
I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

I wanna walk with you, follow in your footsteps
Talk with you to find out where my goods kept
I been gone away from home for so long
Seems like everything I try to do without you go wrong
I'm confused about a lot of things, but not with my fate
So I'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
See I'm a sinner in the 3rd degree
Ain't afraid to admit it, cause I seen niggas worse than me
Who am I to judge a man when I'm a man myself
In the dark, trying to get me some help
I went from pawn to king, king back to pawn
Doing my best to try to ease out the storm
I know that every tunnel's got an end and a light
And I prepared a new beginning in Christ
My life is like a jigsaw dulling in time
And as I'm thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine


It seems like every other Wednesday I'm attending a wake
But I don't question you, I know that's your way, ok
I know we living for the minute and there's a moment in time
We've got to leave here, cause that's your design
And nothing lasts forever, not even spirit, only your word
That's what I live by, cause that's what I heard
I wasn't there when you rose from the dead or parted the sea
I never seen you, but still I believe
How you explain the moon, the sky, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea, the earth without form facing the deep
In darkness challenging the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds, to make up the trees
So why we turn our backs on the truth?
It's heaven or hell, the point we seem to hide from the youth
And I was singing this morning, got touched by the spirit
So I wrote it down for the homies to hear it


Lord I know that I've been wrong
They say a man is lost without a prayer, without a song
So I'm singing on my knees cause I believe you'll keep me strong
Until it's time for me to bring it home
But until it's time for me to bring it home
I'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood
Even gangsters need to pray, cause when I pray it's understood
That I got flaws about myself, I can't make it by myself
I need the heaven's help, I want to follow in your foot steps
Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
And given all his glory to God cause God towers
Over all, and in that I save this prayer
For all my homies that's been trapped out there
That's stuck in their ways, it's different now than back in the days
So fuck what they say, cause ain't no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about


I just want to be your solider
I just want to be your vessel, woooo lord
Ho! It's young 'Face, slanging yay everyday
Heavyweight, got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind non-stop till I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas stay the fuck up out my way
I'm a true OG, you can quote what I say
I'm an H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, Ridin' Dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Trae
And I don't gangbang, I patrol the game
And what I'm representing here is putting holes in brains
Before I say the same thing I'll be old and grey
'Fore I fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
Gripping grain and popping trunks, dog but that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in eighty-three
I stay street, when it's done, that's that
You could find me in your hood pumping monster crack
I roll over rodents in Rovers with rims on 'em
Sniffing out a rat I expose him and then dome him
A lot of nigga's bitches, they claim that they OGs
A straight up pussy and claims that he knows me
You see I, putting out these DVDs
Now my shit done hit the streets, he gots to squat the pee
Got the Feds on his team so they watching me
Mousetrap for a rat, pussy watch and see
 + {UTP}
I've been straight {for a long time}
Getting cake {for a long time}
E&J {for a long time}
Nigga {try to get like this!}
I've been a G {for a long time}
In the street {for a long time}
Toting heat {for a long time}
Nigga {try to get like this!}
{I got big dog status} *8X*

Hey I'm they fave
They say pressure busts pipes, but I ain't scared
It's my pleasure to tell it right, don't think I ain't said
Cause they got prices on my head homie, I don't slip
Clips long as giraffe necks, that's why I don't trip
Just open up and let it rip, ain't nothing new to a G
Hey I ain't worried about these niggas till they shooting at me
My partner died, daughter too, give excuses to me
Still a buster ass rapper I'm refusing to be
Scarface seem to say I'm the king, you a fool if you think
There's another young new rapper dude out there cooler than me (Haha)
I cruise in the V, brand new with the beat
I live a real life like I say I do in the beat
Yo, true indeed, I do indeed
Do it for the OG's and the true MC's
Them busters say this year I got brand new and it's all phat
Cut that fighting in the club, I'm done with all that
Nigga ass out of line, well his ass getting wet
Give a west side nigga ten stacks, that's that
Oh, or maybe less as a matter of fact
Nigga be testing the professor, what's the matter with cats?


I've been doing this shit, nigga who are you?
Lil nigga, I done seen keys bigger than you
Lil nigga, you ain't know shit
Cut off a nigga head, make him suck his own dick
How the game go? Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistols into y'all face
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistols into y'all face
Yeah!

I came here to exercise my game
Spread love to the hood is how I do my thang
Smoking weed with my homies, barbeque them wangs
Sip Hennesey and coke cause I don't fuck with drank
Don't pop pills either cause that shit ain't cool
We just drunk a Mad Dog 'fore we went to school
Flick off, back then I was smashing boys
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now, I demand respect
And if I slapped one ho, then her man was next
I'm a kick door robber, a hot-shot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If it's a dare to be made, then I'm finna make it
But if it ain't no way, then believe I'm finna take it
Cause a nigga with no hustle, it ain't worth this G
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
I've been good at bullshitting but this game can cost
And if a nigga can't maintain, mayne he lost
He a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail I heard
And as a nigga, I come in here with my balls and my word
Snuck up behind him, had his hands in his pocket
Took my pistol out, unlocked it
Pulled the hammer back and - cocked it
And left his shit all on the carpet
I seen a (murder, murder) I pin-pointed my target
I'm making my way up out the building
I got the nigga that I came here to get, notify his children
That they old man done fell up out the game
Because I came through this motherfucka
And killed his ass just like Jesse James

Think it's a motherfuckin game?
I come around this muthafucka and kill yo ass just like Jesse James
What's my motherfuckin name?

There'll be no witnesses to this homicide
No re-enactment on the late night news to be re-dramatized
All you got is a nigga with a dot
In the middle of his motherafuckin head he been shot
Dropped in the middle of the floor and he ain't breathin
And the nigga's on the go cause we ain't seen him
He did his dirt and got the fuck up out the picture
The hollow point just hitcha, out of line, so it got witcha
Call the motherfuckin helicopter
But ain't no hope, cause the Tina broke that nigga off a hella proper
That oughta hold your monkey ass (motherfucka, you)
That oughta teach your funky ass (motherfucka, you)
I know this motherfuckin game is sheist
And you done lost the fuckin game of life
And that's a motherfuckin shame
You let a nigga come around and do yo ass just like Jesse James

Think it's a motherfuckin game?
I come around this muthafucka and kill yo ass just like Jesse James
What's my motherfuckin name?

Wait - this motherfucka got me bent, I gots to - break
Because this nigga done put his hands all up in my - face
He best to chill before I hit him with this - mace
And catch this motherfuckin case
Cause once I got him blind, then he done with
Because I'm true to myself, fuck the dumb shit
You ain't no motherfuckin gangsta, gee
And when I get up out your ass you gon' realize it just ain'tsta be
It ain't no studio up in me
And all that bullshit I'm hearin you talk only offends me
And lately I'm under a lot of pressure
It seems to me you can't come clean, so yo, I gots to check ya
I pull my .45 and (buck, buck, buck, buck)
And right before he die I (fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck)
I could give a motherfuck about the sentence
I snatch yo ass up off the hinges cause I'm (SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE)
Cause life has no meaning, no meaning
We were all born to die, so no screaming
Think it's a motherfuckin game?
I'll come around this motherfucka and cut yo ass just like Jesse James
Blow out your motherfuckin brains

Think it's a motherfuckin game?
I come around this muthafucka and kill yo ass just like Jesse James
What's my motherfuckin name?
Sunday morning I'm off at church
Sinnin' throughout the week, hustlin' every day
Gettin' it as we speak, listen to preacher preach
Choir singing the song, annie clapping her hands
Momma singing along, I'm impatient I wanna leave
Can't let my Momma see, I ain't listening to the word
Not like I don't believe, but I'm trippin' nobody perfect
To speak it wouldn't worth it for a person to be so Christ like
But I swear, I heard him cursin'
Let him without no sins cast the first stone
But I am so not him so let me go on on
Get home and he will find his hat on
Who's family when this all went on
Come on, let's see, some laughs, then we
Can do the same damn thing again next week
I love it when It happens like that
I smile cause it's not all bad

You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it ain't all bad

Monday mornin' it's back to business
Cash the motivation, cops steady watchin'
Plottin' and waiting patient
Yeah I been thinkin' lately
Prayin' on even maybe
Probably best if I left it
The stress will drive you crazy if you let it
The penitentiary is where were headed
Designed for downfalls and some still don't get it
And yeah I might have said it way back and got sweated by
The same ones that hittin' it now but no credit came to me
If you can see the things I see
Then you could point your fingers at the blame not me
Ashamed how we can't stand one another
We hate the idea of a unified young brother so we suffer
But I adapt cause I'm a hustler
I still stay strapped with the muffler
I'm ten toes trapped in the struggle cause
I'm what the hood made mothafucka what

You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it ain't all bad

As solid these niggas come, realist they ever made
Money is not important it's livin' it how you say
Picture back in the day, me moving a brick a week
Murdered you if I had to nigga I'm from the streets
And out here were playing for keeps, speak and your getting froze
Neck gettin' wrapped in sheets, sneakers will be exposed
This bullet here for your soul
Bitches is just for sex, that said I could jack my dick
She don't deserve respect, I'm knowin' my niggas feel it
Nothin' is fabricated authentic as I can say it
The only way I play it, this is for Curtis Davis
Mothers of fallen soldiers, Children of murdered fathers
Fathers out on the corners
Corners I'm standing on and I love 'em without a reason
Feelin they aid the bleedin' they made me I'm never leavin'
Though the looks can look deceiving
Believe me yall it might sound sad
But trust me dog it's not all bad

You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it ain't all bad
You win some, you lose some, life in a nutshell
Free all my niggas on locked down, fuck jail
I've seen enough hell to never wanna live there
Tattooed teardrops, sitting in a wheelchair
Kids on the streets doing bad, momma moved out
Dopeman pushing on the corner where the schoolhouse sits
This is bullshit, this can't be life
I can't blame it on the hood 'cuz it gave me  life
This a stick-up, don't turn it to a 187
I don't go to church so I'm far from a Reverend
Ain't nothing like a young nigga, armed with an AK
Walking up the sidewalk, shooting in the broad day
Fuck what a broad say, I'm all day villain
I'm getting money so I'm always chilling
And even though they say I'm killing all they children
I'm just a nigga hustling for my million dollars

You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
I and I stay rooted

Now if I had to play Jack, I'll be leaving you bad news
Everybody in here be bound and gagged too
I'm postin' at your crib nigga hurry yo ass home'
You was out here hi-capping and all yo stash gone
The money met the work and that's a real life no-no
It don't take a bunch of niggas, just me solo
I go for dolo, I can't tell on myself
Immature ass niggas get you sentenced to death
Loud talking in the tank like he a stone cold killer
And you fighting a murder charge, my nigga?
The moral of the story is keeping your mouth shut
'Cause everybody is listening, speaking you fucked up
I tell you like them old cats say: get what you get and get your ass out the way
'Cause greed'll get you 35 type, you're 27, that's the rest of your fucking life

[You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted]
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
I and I stay rooted
(It's in my DNA, my blood type G, my roots is deep up in these motherfucking streets)

Real recognize what's real, the bullshit see through
The way I spit it, ain't another one that's equal
This for my people in the game ten toes, rooted in the streets, and withholding info
We got secrets we gon' take to the grave
We don't honor nothing else, except the rules of getting paid
And no wonder why a motherfucker hustling dope
Everything we doing legal eagle leaving us broke
What I hope is that a nigga don't forget where he from
And turn his back on his hood cause he's seeing some crumbs
And no money in the world that's enough to respect, when somebody take a gun and put it up to your chest
Saying 'fuck it' at the same time he squeezing a round
You can blame it on your homeboy for keeping you down
If it was me, I'd be leery of the people I meet, cuz in this motherfucking game niggas playing for keeps

You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
I and I stay rooted
I would, never violate the codes of the streets
And I would never make a promise, that I know I couldn't keep
And I would, never testify, cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police
And you could, never catch me on the block without a strap
And I would, never pull it out unless I'm bouts to black
And I could, never forget my homies dyin for they scratch
Forever pourin out liquor for 'em, God send me back
And I'll, never shed tears, my heart is like a stone now
Never thought I'd live to see 21 look I'm grown now
Never say never they tell me all the time
Cause never means it's forever, but it's never crossed my mind
And I'll, never go broke, I promise I'mma shine
Never come short on my issue, I'm on it every time
And I'll, never be passive, you better gimme me mine
It's my money, and I want it, every motherfuckin dime
No I, never forgot all my struggles in the past
And I could, never forget how to hustle for my cash
And I will, never forget how I felt when I saw Brad
Take that first breath and from then, I knew I had to mash
And it could, never be said I went out like a ho
Never been punked, I'll never let it slide, never let it go
Never ever, never ever ever no
Get on my level ho, or get a shovel ho
It's never any question for my manhood I get down
I'll never switch, never snitch, never sit down
I'll never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
I'll never squat to take a piss, who's the bitch now
I never ran, I never will, I ain't never scared
It's in my bloodline, the realest nigga ever bred
And that's some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics, I ain't never dead
I'll never disrespect my momma, never disrespect her momma neither
I'll never turn my back on Jesus
I'll never get caught off in the system, cause I believe a
Man that follows man, ain't no man, and I'm a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga, I could never trade
I'll never cross my homies out, that I ain't how I'm made
And I never had not one regret, on how I was raised
I'm from the ghetto, where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way, this ain't gon' never change
Never gon' bite my tongue, FUCK what nigga say
100 with myself I swore to God I'd stay the same
And when I finally got my paper, I was on my game
I'll never talk a nigga down, do yo' thang dawg~!
Never hate a dude for tryin, that's insane dawg
Get yo' motherfuckin money, that's the thang dawg
Too many homies dyin young, feel my pain y'all
(Riiinnnngggg) "Dont answer that"
"Hello, I'm not at home, leave a message" (beep)
"Yo, bitch, this is (beep) pick up the phone, bitch
I know you're in there
You fucking with that old fucking ass 'Face now, huh bitch
Where my motherfucking kids at, bitch
Fucking bitch, punk ass bitch!"

Hey, today must be my lucky day
I turned the corner, hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away
(Now where's she stayin'?) She must be new in the hood
But I ain't trippin' on that shit, cause it's all good
I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name
Ain't a damn thing changed , ain't no shame in my game
She said, "Used to go Thomas"
I slowed my roll, cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas
Now where your man at, she said "Gone at work"
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinkin', "Go on and flirt"
My homies women ain't no thing to me
Cause if they caught one of my ho's, they'd do the same to me
And furthermore she was peepin' my ride
Convertible, '64, with the ride inside
Super clean with the discs and vogues
Higher than a fuck spittin' this to hoes
(CHORUS)
Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight . 

Reminiscin' on the bitch that I had back in the day
Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face
Now thats the pits
She didn't have to put up a front
I stuck that ass back in there
And haven't called her for 3 months
I guess it's in me to be doggin' a chick
Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master
Let her take a ride with the Bradster
It's cool, don't front, no sex, no sweat
Not even on my mind, we just met
And furthermore, we can get to those
But for now I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to hoes:
CHORUS

Now I'm cruisin' to the crib with this bitch that I scooped
Parked my Ferrari, now I'm back in the coup
I knocked her boots - your baby's mama put me to work
I tagged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt
She wanted me badly so I put it inside
She got the (front, back, and side to side)
Back and forth with the gangster glide
Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9
Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the day
Now she's asleep, cause she just had her drawers full of dick
(now thats sick) and plus she got you staying at home
With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on
So believe me when you downin' the Brad
I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass
So player hatin' niggas check the bitch you chose
I'll be mobbing in my 'benz spitting this to hoes:
CHORUS
What can I do?
What can I do, to make it better?
Yeah, yeah

I thank the Lord, for every morning, he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining, there's a cloud in the sky
Lettin' me know, that at any moment, there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is, there still can be pain
Down the park, I hear the sirens, just a screamin' away
And then the inevitable happens, the end of them days
As sad as it sounds, but that's the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth, will taketh away (will taketh away)
I live and I learn, I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash, it reminds me of the now and the past
I say me a prayer, cause eventually I'll stand in the path
Of the souls and dark roads that lead to rest

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone like you and me)
Take away their fears

And then a child is born
Bloody naked, clingin' to life
Unaware of his surroundings or if breathin' is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams (baby's alive)
At the same time, another mother, murders her kids
And the unbearable thought of this here just brings me to tears
It's hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith, and killin' your pearls
And sometimes, I sit it down, and wonder myself
But then again, I ain't Jesus, and I couldn't help
All I can do, is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds ‘cause dealin’ with that
Would be the hardest thing, I’d ever have to do in my time
I'd have to take my own life too, and I couldn't climb
The stairway that you hear me singin' bout in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin' his kid ain't decidin' the time
I know it's truth, the next day, we just livin' to die
But I believe if you livin' right, you'll live in the sky
Lookin' down on the good and the bad, the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did, before you had to go

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(someone to dry their tears) Take away their fears
Can I make it, better? (I want to make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through? (they're through)
What can I do?
What can I do?

I say goodbye to you cruel world, I see peace in the red sky
I see the beast when the dead die, relief when my head’s high
Hear the streets up ahead cry, when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye, 'fore the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table, the tale of the tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John Doe’s that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb, but I’m cool, I’m cool
(Kelly Price)
Do you hear me?
I'm cryin'

Do you hear them, crying? (x2 to fade)
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(someone to dry their tears)
Take away their fears (take away their fears)
Can I make it, better? (gonna make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through?
(everything they're goin' through) What can I do?
What can I do?
(Say, Face .. nigga, I think I can fade you now)
What, fade me how?
(Sheeit, on this rap shit)
Come on, nigga..
I brought my chopper and my hard hat
The shit's fucked up now show a nigga where the war at
Cause I'm about to clean house
Stick this a.k. up your ass and blow that fucker clean out
Cause you niggas in the wrong
You came up short and now we fin to get it going on
I ain't your average motherfucker
You step out of line and watch a motherfucker bust ya
Cause you done came at me the wrong way
I ain't no Clint Eastwood, nigga, and you done picked the wrong day
So bring your ass to the battleground
Rat-a-tat-tat, like that is how my gat'll sound
Avoid no niggas cause niggas be human
I squeeze the trigger and niggas be moving
Cause I don't point it in the air and pull the trigger (why?)
I'd rather point it at your ass and watch the nigga die
I gives a fuck about your team mates
When it's all said and done you're gonna wish you never seen 'face
You shoulda seen that lil nigga Brad
James through here, seen Dave and, yo that nigga bad
And your homies better stand still
Don't make my brother Warren bust one of you bitches cause the man will
Don't bring your ass to my picnic
Cause I done had it up to here with all you niggas talking that bitch shit
So you better get your shit right
I'm from the state where you rarely see a motherfucking fist fight
It's all about the gun blast
So you can miss me with that bullshit you spitting with your punk ass
It's the diary of a born killer
Don't have to worry about me falling off this thang cause I'm a strong nigga
Doubt my regard of the hard
With niggas behind me from East Oakland to the South Park
I've got the mind of the man right behind ya
You can run, you can hide but I'll still find ya
Like I say there's no getaway
And I'm gon' have it where your family'll have to throw your shit away
It's the return of the real niggas
I'm prejudiced to a certain extent but still I kill niggas
I'll bust that ass on the fucking double
So push on with that ho shit, bitch, cause you don't want trouble
So get your ass up of my shoestrings
And let your shermed nigga do things
Ay, ay, ay where you fin to go, fool?
(I can't fuck with it, you got it, man)
Come on, man .. you wanna rap, nigga?
(I can't do it) Come on
You see, you see! That's how motherfucker is, dogg
That's how motherfuckers be, punk ass hoes
You motherfuckers better quit fucking with me like this
That's really doe
* a/k/a/ "Look Into My Eyes"

Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see
Do you think I'm cra-zy??? (AAAAAGHHH!! Just bein me)
Sometimes I wanna die, maybe I'll be free
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin me
(I can feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed
Look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes)
And tell me what you see (and tell me what you see)
Can you see my future, and what lies down the line?
Is it just my test, or is it just my time?
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did
I forgot to get picked off, when i was just a kid
A poison in my mind, tryin to find relief
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin me
Tryin' to set me up, bustin down my streets
Blockin' up my door, to see if he can catch me
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what niggas say
Fuck Ronnie Carbone(?), and fuck the D.E.A
And fuck these undercovers, that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese
And I ain't finna snitch, cause I don't know a thang
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane
I know you crackrs pissed off, I can see it in your eyes
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die
(Until the day that I die)
So fuck you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie
You just wanna destroy me, just like you did my god
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth
Listen up my niggas: "The F.B.I. been watchin' you"
Especially if you black, and tryin to leave the streets
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin me
Runnin in my crib, makin niggas lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed
But not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me?

Look me in my eyes!
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?(My eyes!)
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee?

Look me in my eyes, I've told all I could tell you
And now you know too much, if you leak a word I'll kill you
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged?
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain
What's up with all these nightmares, this long rewinding road
That leads me to the same place I started from;
Right before I left home
(Look me in my eyes!) I thought you was a shrink
Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think
OK your time is up, now analyze my life
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes
(Look me in my eyes, my eyes)
You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations, when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers, I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes
Looked me in my eyes
(2x)
(And meanwhile, on the Southside of town...)
Chorus:
Now when you're rollin' through yo' muthafuckin' hood
What do you see?
(I see some muthafuckin' G's)
Now when you're rollin' through yo' muthafuckin' hood
Tell me what you see?
(Some muthafuckin' G's)
(Verse 1)
Roamin' in my muthafuckin' hood and thangs
Seems to me my mutherfuckin' hood done changed
Cause niggas used to kick it with the rival gangs
But now we gots to deal with them survival thangs
.45 in my lap when I'm on the creep
Niggas livin' shife, so I roll one deep
Cause now they see me flippin' in the 1-9-9-4
C.S.I. nigga, black 850
And now they lookin' at me crazy
But off-brand niggas can suck a dick because they can't fade me
And if it came down to the gun, black
I never cracked up under pressure, cause I was trained for combat
So get yo' muthafuckin' boys together
I represent S.A., nigga, and we makin' noise forever
And gettin' paid at the same time
So you respect a muthafucka when a muthafucka claim mine
Cause if you disrespect, you ass out
And they we rolling through yo' shit in the Glasshouse
Actin' bad with the flashers on
Makin' niggas get they asses on
Cause ain't no mutherfuckin' love for fools
Who come around this muthafucka trying to scrub, you fools
It ain't no haps on it, hops
We snaps on the cops
And straps on the Glocks
And take the law into our own hands
Cause you ain't fucking with a rookie, nigga, you fucking with a grown man
And we gon' show you what we mean by funk
Muthafucka, you ain't see my trunk
I got a (SK) and a (AK)
And a (12 gauge) that'll fuck a nigga whole day
So recognize a real nigga from the streets
When you rolling through yo' mutherfuckin' hood, what do you see?
Chorus...
(Verse 2)
Hollerin at my homie at the swisher house
Scored a 40 bag and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park and got up under the tree
Pull the swishers out and gave the ganja to 3
Rapped us up a fattie and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin' red cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin' cause it's all good
And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood
But other niggas don't wanna see it that way
But all I got to say is: you don't wanna see that S.A
Because we're all upon a mission
Killin don't make us no different
And dyin don't make it no different
Cause I done been to mo' wakes in this past year
Than the muthafuckin Bengals lost last year
So ain't no muthafuckin' thang for me
To kill a nigga who ain't fuckin' with the gang with me
Chorus...
(Verse 3)
Formaldehyde smokin, niggas gettin' loc'ed and
Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scoping, hoping for you to fuck up and slip
So we can have a reason for fuckin' up your shit
(It ain't no muthafuckin' peace when they see me)
Cause we never had a muthafuckin' peace treaty
So I know I got to get em with game
And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
Cause it's kill or be killed, never cut slack
And if you cut slack, they bust back, fuck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
Cause if they bust one time, that be the worst one
And that's the one that can close the shop
So you gotta stand and hold the Glock
Cause in my muthafuckin' hood, that's how it be
But when you're rollin' through your muthafucking hood, what do YOU see?
Chorus...
(Bun B)
I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
Had to find my place
But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
Had to dodge a case
Had to dodge a bullet
And the nigga that tried to pull it
The streets is throwed
If I don't get lean and blowed everyday
I feel just like I'mma explode on overload and overdrive
All my life this drive I tried
I seen a lot of good niggas die
Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
Or somebody's a bitch
I wish I could change the past
But I gots to live in the present and pray
That tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast
Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me
But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself
I found out she had to told me
Just to show me just how good I had it
I guess I couldn't see it
Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it
But that was just the way we used to G it
One of the wrongest niggas I see
Or one of the strongest niggas I know
Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know
So I put weed in the bong and I blow
Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
Child that grew into a man that's widely respected
Too real
(Chorus)
I feel no pain
I can't complain
Stuck in the game
Tryin to maintain
Cause I'm so real
(Pimp C)
We blow big everyday
But that don't stop our pain
Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
Got niggas doin 40
When you 25 that's life
I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
These bitch ass niggas shife
Niggas might snitch out they momma
That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama
Cause we ain't promised tommorow
But nigga you promised to die
Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry
At night I talk to God and try to understand
How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back
So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
I still love my piece and chain, wood grain and big head ones
But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun
I guess that's true for some
But them hoes will never win
Out here just hustlin and grindin
Tryin to change from niggas to men
Chorus
(3-2)
My nigga you a ho to me
Boy you done went off on me
Runnin round with the fakin and hatin
I'mma blast if you run up on me
I'mma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch
This matter coulda been resolved
If you woulda came clean and paid my shit
See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last
Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass
And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up
No respect for your family that's dead
Don't write yo peoples locked up
Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game
Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name
You boys is funny
I'm bout my money
And oh so true
Mr. 3-2 when I never trusted you
I'm too real
Chorus
(Scarface talking)
Yo anybody seen my diary? Oh there it is
I gotta write this shit down. Check it out
Dear Diary, I'm having a little problem
I can't make it by myself maybe you can help me solve em
I'm confused and I don't know what to do
I'm hoping you can help me cause there's no one else to talk to
I want to die, but it ain't for me
I try to talk to my dad, but my old man ignores me
He says I'm delirious
And I drink too much, so he doesn't take me serious
But little does he know I'm really losing it
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
I be thinking deep
That's one of the reasons at night I can't sleep
I thought it would change when I was older
But even now I'm still peeping over my shoulder
Is there life after death too?
And what about the nigga with the cane and the black suit?
And what about cancer?
Too many motherfucking questions, and not enough answers
Ain't no use in trying
We might as well face it we were all born dying
There's a black book in Brad's hands
And its the diary of a madman
(chorus)
Dear diary today I hit a nigga with the torch
Shot him on his face and watched him die on his front porch
Left his family heartbroken
Flashbacks of him laying there bleeding with his eyes open
I can't put the shit behind me
I'm know I'm here somewhere, but I can't find me
I used to be a drug dealer
On the fo rilla, now I'm a born killer
And it ain't no changing me
It used to be hard, but now it ain't no thing to me
To go up to a niggas house
Put a pistol in his mouth, and blow his fucking brains out
No doubt if you cross then I'mma take ya
Cause I'm a fucking killer by nature
You got an M11, bring your weapon
Huh, I got an AK-47
It's gonna be a bloody Sunday
Cause your fucking with a nigga like Bundy
And I was taught not to care
Like a Vietnam vet with a thousand yard stare
So welcome to the slaughterhouse nigga
Redrum and I'mma be the grave digger
And if you want to cap, come cap me
I'm trigger happy like my great-grandpappy
Just watch for the chrome in my right hand
My second entry from the diary of a madman
(Chorus)
Dear diary, help me cause I'm frantic
S-sometimes I think I'm going schizophrenic
The world's looking dark for instance
Maybe cause I'm looking from a distance
But then again I wear a blindfold
Staring at the motherfucking world with my eyes closed
To myself I'm a stranger
Walking in the footsteps of danger
It's a long path ahead of me
I gotta get somewhere cause everybody here is scared of me
I had a job but they fired me
My wife walked off now I'm living in my diary
I got the new 'Face tape I'm about to, pop in the deck for you niggas
Turn up your radios

You're down and out, money funny, you hustle and die
On the verge of pawnin your jewelry and sellin your ride
Somebody shoulda told him ain't no life in these streets
You only out here 'til you touch it, when you touch it you eat
Niggas done took too many chances shovelin snow
And ended up facin a lifetime for tryin to sco'
I'm givin livin definitions on the subject of dope
One week he back on his feet, the next he's WHOA
I was a 70's baby, raised in the 80's
I was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
I remember in the 80's, me and pop would ride
Now we conversate on acres we's about to buy
He had already been what I'm about to go through
Told me ain't no sense in gamblin if you gamble to lose
If you made twelve dollars, you put seven away
And lived off the five, and never ever fuck with your safe
But when

When he hustle and he robbin'
That's when niggas start plottin'
And when you niggas start plottin'
Us country niggas start mobbin', mobbin'

I'm bout my paper, these other niggas slang for the sport
Like unaware tomorrow ain't promised, the game is too short
I've witnessed niggas get it all and give it away
Gettin back was out of the question, they lived for today
Then the hunger pains start up, then the murderous plots
To set up, they fuckin homeboy to get what he got
I mean the ones he broke the bread with, the ones you don't want
To be the ones fuckin your girlfriend the moment you out
I know the street game backwards, forwards, sideways
It used to be an honest hustle back then but nowadays
It's cutthroat, that's fucked up, niggas want they come up
So bad they'll take the .357 and smoke they brother
A damn shame; but, that's the way the game go
A chance niggas is takin especially if they slang dope
I've been in that position, back in the day
In fear of my homie hittin' my head to crack in my safe
And that's when

When ya hustle ain't evolvin
That's when niggas start starvin
And when you niggas start starvin
That's when you niggas start robbin (when these niggas start robbin)
When these niggas got problems
That's when niggas start plottin
And when you niggas start plottin
Us country niggas start mobbin - mobbin

So listen up my niggas, and I ain't tryin to preach
I'm just tellin it from my side 'cause I'm in the streets
I done been there, done that, seen a whole neighborhood
Destroyed by the government bein tipped off by one rat
He caught a dope case and they threatened him with time
He get his own fuckin people jammed and he take the five
That's the shit there; they ain't even catch him with dope
But they gave him thirty-five years 'cause the nigga done spoke
Snitchin, that's a motherfucker, watch what you say
You don't know no-motherfuckin-body, nigga, you lame
Watch your so-called homeboys, keep to yourself
Stay away from niggas gettin caught that get out of jail
Don't talk about your business, keep yo' thoughts in yo' head
And this game it got a paper trail, watch where ya spend
Don't write down names and numbers, it's a memory thing
Never shit where ya sleep, keep the crib out of range
And plus you never let these niggas know where you stay
'Cause when the push turns to a shove, they hittin your safe
True motherfuckin' game, true motherfuckin' game

When ya hustle ain't evolvin'
That's when niggas start starvin'
And when you niggas start starvin'
That's when you niggas start robbin'
When these niggas got problems'
That's when niggas start plottin'
And when you niggas start plottin'
Us country niggas start mobbin', mobbin'
Chorus:
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short I got the
Money and the power
Yup! Hehehahaha, hehe ha hah hah.. yeah
Money and the power, money and the power
Never goin back cause I got
Money and the power

Deep in the heart of South Park lurks a stalker
S.A. fool, native Houston South Parker
Born and brought up to be a heartless motherfucker
No one else to blame, fuck it blame it on my mother
When I was growin up nobody seemed to give a shit
And that's what makes me one hard son of a bitch
Since they ain't give a shit, I ain't give a shit either
Sweet 16, time to stack me up some ki's
Learned the game of hustlin, fuckin over fiends
Sellin niggas beat, in other words amphetamines
My game was more advanced, sellin speed I'm goin broke
Got em up with Floyd and Floyd had fronted me some dope
Learned to rock it up, now I got it sold
Time to go for broke, motherfuck who I owe
Business started boomin, started movin powder
Motherfuck the bitches I want money and the power.. yup!
Chorus:
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short I got the
Money and the power
Yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
Bitches on my dick cause I got
Money and the power

Bought me a Caddy, 30's and vogues
Brand new crib, brand new clothes
Mom would ask questions, and often pitch a bitch
Where am I gettin the money? Mickey D's ain't paid me shit
I'd make up a story, just to get her off my back
Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack
Everything was smooth, exactly how I played it
A dollar to be made, best believe a nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties, and sixty cent bumps
Nigga rollin hard, stackin paper like Trump
And I ain't give a fuck I told you that from the jump
Didn't worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump
Ass out of line, word em up a nigga sprayed em
Momma told me shoot first, and ask questions later..
Six hundred bucks a motherfuckin hour
And I ain't fallin short cause I got money and the power, yup
Chorus:
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short 'cause I got the
Money and the power
Yeah..
Money and the power, money and the power
I got it like dat, cause I got
Money and the power

There goes 21, and still stackin 30's
Brought my brother Warren Lee down from New Jersey
He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up
Said fuck gettin paid, I guess my brother'd rather fuck
Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin Lee
I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause Ak'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggas stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggas up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'mma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will
Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin noise
Hehehehehe.. I guess the juices are sour
But I ain't fallin short cause I got money and the power YUP!
Chorus:
Money and the power, money and the power
Sold a million records I got
Money and the power
Yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
Best to come clean, cause I got
Money and the power
Money and the power, money and the power
Money and the pow-the-pow-the-pow-the-pow-the-power!
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Verse 1
It's like I have been living a lie
It's beautiful huh the way I can keep it inside
I'm settled in somebody's dream
Seeing through one of his eyes
Pieces of somebody's mind
Pictures of thoughts in the frame
I stand alone in the dark now
Sad and crippled and shamed
I loaded my pistol and aimed
Cocked it quick and then bang
Woke up in sweat feeling the death
Creates an eclipse in the brain
Sometimes I think I'm insane
I hear the voice when I'm asleep
Whispers my name again and again
This is what's she's singing to me
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Verse 2
Sometimes I just want to cry
We kiss in the rain
She is speaking to me once again
Hands in my ear
But this isn't clear
I listen but nothings explained
This is a lie
A feeling inside
I still often drift when I drive
The tears they leave burns on my cheeks
Motionless mirrors with eyes staring me down
A view of a soul
The heart of a woman is cold
My conscious is weak
She making me weak
The only love I've ever known has left me alone
And I'm dying inside
The only thing left is my pride
The pain you hear in my rhyme
For happiness I'll never find
All in my mind
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Bridge
I think I've finally failed at something
I honestly believe that
Cause looking at us from outside
You would think we would take better care of our hearts
I died when you did mentally
Spiritually?
I'm numb I feel nothing
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
”The moment that is bound to shape the future…”

I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened and read it, they tellin’ me to dead it
It said that the message I was bringing brought destruction
I put the pen to the pad and said “Fuck them”
Here’s a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me from the jump; they’d rather see me slump
Face down, shot five or six times
With my kid and her mama in the cop car crying, and I’m dying
Stop lying, it’s a black and white thang
Redneck ass judge would rather watch a nigga hang
Than indict what’s white, not right, fuck a news feed
Black men got the same needs as the Jews need
Who me? I demand reparation
Fuck a cowboy, I’m a native robbed of my nation
I’m an African, Black man, fucked out my language
Got me praying to a white boy God, that’s insane
And if you ask me, why they steadily harass me
I reply with that “These muthafuckas nasty”
And I’m a god yet they calling me a nigga
They scared of me, so they try to hide behind the trigger
Acting bad ass, fuck a honkey with a badge
I’m a nigga with an attitude, you can kiss my black ass
Ain’t no sense in niggas being diplomatic
Televise the revolution, let these muthafuckas have it
I’m calling up the homies, they said to come through
And I run with them niggas ain’t scared to come shoot
Take an eye for an eye, take a tooth for tooth
Do unto others as them others would do onto you
And now they saying “Make America Great”
But what America hates kept America straight
And America safe, muthafuck that flag
My people are not free, we wanna touch that bag
So quick to try to copyright what came for free
Now they blaming me, and it’s plain to see
That they mad at that, like I’m a magic act
Yeah, imagine that; muthafucka, I’m Black
Fuckin’ vultures, super quick to steal one’s culture
Trying to make it your own; caveman, go home
Over-tan, long nose, funny-looking ass Donald
Got his nerve disrespecting President Obama
If you don’t want us around then let us leave
Pay the money you’ve been owing my peoples as they were set free
That 40 acres and a mule never came
And yet we’re still outstanding—out standing in the rain
Just waiting, patient, pacing, and praying
For God to step up, and not ain’t shit shaking
I was mistaken thinking scripture coulda helped us
Following the faith of our very own oppressors
No justice, just us
Look at how the aftermath of slavery today still affects us
Our kids educated by the enemy
And they don’t know shit about their history
‘Cause they ain’t teaching that in school
Leave it up to them coons, and all that’s cool
Let the bygones be bygone
And besides, we’ve been killing off our own
Shut the fuck up, you know what?
Uncle Tom, house nigga slaves need they muthafuckin’ nuts cut
I pack steel in the hour of the chaos
If Black lives still don’t matter to you, stay out
I'm representin fo' my niggas on lock, doin time for that he-say
She-say, layin niggas down on the freeway
Believe me, they need me, cause all these mouse-ass niggas
Comin home too long before they release date
He facin twenty-five years fed time
And he ain't never seen a day in that thang, he bustin head time
Let's keep it real, I got the documents to prove
That youse a snitchin-ass nigga tryin to hide behind your music
You hit the highway, got money the fly way
You phony, youse a ho-ass nigga that's what I say
And you can quote this and niggas wanna touch you
Last album I was 'Made' this album the motherfucker so
All you niggas wanna plot against the mob
Since you wanna make it hot I'm fin' to, adjust your knob
I'm high powered

Beep beep goes the sound of my cellular
It's the life of a hustler
You know we livin in danger
And dem I treat just like strangers

Real nigga he don't talk about it he be about it, cause he a G about it
I got a problem with a nigga I go squeeze him out
And what the fuck am I gon' talk to the police about?
I'm from the streets doin the type of shit you read about
I got chrome 45's under pressure, and in the dresser
And now you're froze on the stretcher
You wanted trouble, I wouldn't settle for lesser
I'm the devil in the flesh, my pistol is my protector
See my reflection as it fades into black
When I reappear on a nigga it's a ragin attack yeah
And I solemnly swear, any problem I have
I just empty the clip and him callin {?} square
That's on my life because I represent the mob
Since you niggas want that heat I'm bouts to, turn up the knob
To high power


Bitch nigga you just a dead man walkin, one foot is inside the grave
The other one is in a closed-top coffin
You're still talkin, like you the O.G
When you was locked down though, you was low-key
Them niggas told me that they had you in the seg
And the locals you was workin with the boys in there
And even had the nerve to go and try to talk to the streets
Thinkin that they'd embrace a marked-as-police
And then you tried to sue a nigga, but it got back to a nigga
And when I see him I'mma do the nigga
So skip that funky-ass deposition fool
Since you wanna crank it up, then that's what I'm about to do
To high power
Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why..
His life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but hey
I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldn't raise
And she will never see her father again, cause he's in a grave
Hey yo, let's think about it, nilla
"My daddy was a dopeman, so I'mma be a dope dealer"
How will the family explain it?
"My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!"
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid livin fly fucks me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizin life is hard
A big time dope dealer's all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situation's got me guessin..
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die
..

It was crazy how it happened
Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera cappin
All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds
And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled - get an ambulance
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You shoulda seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head
He just laid there in silence..
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up..
Followed by a law man and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher..
But if he survives, I'm willin to betcha
He'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by ?? on Scott Street
School was lettin out
"Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?" "WATCH ME!"
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun..
.. he shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullard
His brother was just dazed in a shock, "Why you do it?"
"Why you shot his moms Jay? Shit"
"Hehehehehe.. hah man fuck that bitch"
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack, "Aiyyo J.D. homey"
Hung it up and rolled down Dagger
Headin for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven niggas all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper
Shit gets deeper but why?
I guess you only get a minute to pray
And a second to die
I'm a born killer, you're face to face with Scarface
You tried to ice an ace, but that's a motherfucking waste
You snoozed, fucked up, G
And your momma shoulda warned you bout a nigga like me
Cause I don't eat and I don't sleep
Save that motherfucking flack, cause talk is cheap
And uh, since you got beef
Lets take it to the streets and I'm a bring it to your ass, chief
I'm coming from the heart son
And I don't take no shit, but I'm about to start some
Now which one a you hoes wanna jump
If you got static, then get it off your chest punk
Cause I ain't barring none
If you're feeling lucky then go ahead and getcha some
I ain't with this fucked shit
If ya ain't in trick, then get your ass in ya trunk bitch
Cause I'm about to square it off
Hit your ass in the chest with the Tec and try to tear it off
Send you back to mommy, in some plastic
And have the bitch out hunting for a casket
I'm on the for realla tilla my nilla
I'm a born killer

I'mma born killer
Born
Killer
"Don't fuck with me"

My momma did her part
But it ain't her fault that I was born without a heart
In other words I'm heartless, dude
I don't love me, how the fuck I'mma love you?
That's right, you guessed it
I'm legally insane, marked manic depressive
I'm taking all types of medication
To keep me out the mood of premeditating
Yo, the longer I'm alone it's worse
I'm having thoughts of killing me, but I'm killing you first
My psychiatrist talks but I don't listen
A victim of society fucked by the system
My whole life's been a see saw
I'm up one day, down and out on tomorrow
Right now I'm even more upset
Some shit done happened to me that I don't think I'll ever forget
You think I'd let it die, but I ain't
It ain't because I want to, its because I can't
I'mma getcha but I ain't going into it
Cause ain't nothing to it but to do it
See it ain't no sweat to me
Cause in the first place, you fucked up the minute that you stepped to me
I'm not your average dealer
I'm a born killer


Now I'm living where I can cause I'm homeless
Can't make important calls cause I'm phoneless
I ain't eating, I'm starving duke
I can't go to momma's house cause momma's starving too
Better grab that 12 gauge
Cause that's the only way a nigga's gonna get paid
I'm on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they don't think that I'd gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And don't think about pushing that panic switch
I'm getting paid and you're getting killed bitch
Take notes to the message I gave ya
Ya dying ho, and can't nothing save ya
I'm doing bad, so I'm going bad
Huh, and you never expected that from Brad
But there's a lot of things pressing me
And I ain't the nigga to let a mortician be dressing me
So I'm coming out winning
A hundred thousand in the case now I'm coming out grinning
But the shit didn't flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pull a ho move
He reached for his pistol
The 12 gauge went "BOOM" should've heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one of you motherfuckers in here wanna die next?
Nobody made a move
And I got away smooth
And that's how it is, nigga
I spared a couple of lives, but I'm still a born killer
Nigga don't act like he don't know who I'm talkin' bout
(Fifty-Cent piece drops on table)

It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day
It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day
What it is?, nigga!
You don't wanna get involved with this here, nigga!
Is you a bitch nigga?, you a bitch nigga!
Look at yourself and then analyze me!
This motherfucking G
It's the flossy, you got girl draws and
Girl flaws and, a braud nigga!
I peeped your whole hand when you came in
I'm a man and I hang men
Play the game to win
All mission play on ten
Scarface 'finna do it again
Mash you nigga, stash them niggas
Don't make me upstrap and blast you niggas
Once again, it's a only if you must I do it
Lock you in my scope and blast your ass through it
I'mma poet
The image and the style that you used to
Cus' you don't keep it real like you used to
A O.G., S.A., fool to the hole fa'sho
So niggas slow your motherfucking roll
'Fore I come through with the same M-11
The Feds took from me, and shoot you in yo motherfucking stomach

You a Snitch Nigga, when you rat on yo friends
Bitch Nigga, when you still be in pads with yo kin
You'z a Snitch Nigga, running when the drama go's down
You was ballin' at first what happened to the man in the south
You a Snitch Nigga, specializin' at bumpin' ya gums
Bitch Nigga, countin' on ya bricks but all I see is crumbs
Snitch Nigga, ain't you tired of running your mouth
And you can go home, 'fore the Devil run in your house

Now snitch fellas get up under my skin
That's why I don't mess with friends
Unless it's my Mac-10
I'm the king of the ghetto, Z-Ro the crooked in the flesh
Looking for head shots, cuz bitch fellas get the bullet-proof vests
What you scared for?
What happened to all the tough ass talk
The way you was bumpin', I thought you had a taste for asphalt
Look at momma's baby out here starvin' for his ass
Whippin', chiefin', with a magician then drippin' out his ass, listen
I'll be damned if I pull a rabbit out a hat
Well pull my 40 out of holster, and do this snitch fella on his back
WHOA!, look how I handled this .44
My conscience be screaming Z-Ro Murder Mo!, Murder Mo!
And these snitch fellas on "How I'm Living" try snitchin' on "BET"
But got a restraining order against "Murder I-N-C"
This how we ride, and ain't never gon' make a switch dude
Z-Ro the Crooked, I'll be damned if I be a snitch fool


It's Bun B I go back-a like "Atlanta Black Crackers"
I back-slap a, back-packer, from here to Cakalacka{Carolina's}
Wack cracka, short stopper or dope beginner
Bitch I ain't ya chicken hitter, bring the heater get you wetter(get you
Wetter)
We can flip the caliber magnum hanger
Step a bear off in his chest, you better hope I don't land one
If I cock the bitch back..aim it at your chest
It'll be piece before they even find the pieces to your vest
We relievers of ya stress..ease ya fame
Put this pistol in your mouth, you better lead them treason games
Now when ya momma warned ya about
Bun and he's insane
Kill a kid over a quarter, who just keeps plain
Now watch this kids plain, 'fore you fuckin with the triller
Z-Ro the young guerilla
And Face the born killa
(Bitch Nigga)
Bend around in the dark for dough
(Bitch Nigga)
You here the sounds you spark for the floor
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round (that's true)
And money makes me do all things that I do
And hang with my homies smoke weed and drink brew
Ride down Belfort one deep and bang Screw
And money makes the world go round, (that's right)
Money makes the world go round, (that's my life)
Livin' in a mansion one day with my wife
Stack me up some papers these days one night
If wind stops blowin' these days to my sight
The winds start flowin' I'm paid, trunk tight
I gots to have paper these days in my life
I gots to have paper these days of my life
Cause money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round

That's right
Money makes the world go round, (straight up)
Money makes the world go round
Everyday up on your life thank your God for your life
That money makes the world go round
Without a doubt
They all want to see you about a clout
They don't know, don't want to know or see what it's about
We faced with danger, do any thing for the paper
Scarred for life mentality of the street life made us
Watch out for the snakes and fakes
Out to take what's yours to make it theirs so prepare and beware
Money makes the world go round for some niggas
Money make the world kill all niggas quicker
The sckrilla, the cabbage, the cheese, the scratch, the cheddar
Whatever you call it, it's all hot

Money makes the world go round

The unfortunates is now fortunate
Cause money makes the world go round
What's up 'Face?

Money makes the world go round

Some people gots to have it, some really need it
A lot might even sacrifice their life to retrieve it
I see that money's good for me, money's good to me
Money can't buy me love but it can rent me some pussy
You get your hands on a little bit of it and before you know it
You go crazy without, do strange things for it
Although it's made of paper, it don't grow on trees
Unless you comin' up sellin' weed, while you blow on sweets
You see money makes the world go round
Makes the price of livin' go up, chances of livin' go down
You see money makes the world go round
If you ain't got it you ain't nothin' but you come up then they hound you
Cause money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round

I take me a shit and try to gather my thoughts
Bumpin' the south/west beat, while I sip on a quart
You see my mind is on a whole lot more than just rappin'
The nigga got to do somethin, until this rap shit happen
It's been a long time, since I got my hand on some cheese
It's gettin' hectic, my daughter can't get what she needs
Shit is fucked up, you wonder why we rob and sell dope?
I go days without eatin, it ain't because I snort coke
Fool I'm broke, what's a good way to get paid these days?
Flip burgers, or lay your ass down to get sprayed
Hey man, I got to reason with ya
Nah, fuck tryin' to reason
I'm tired of strugglin' so now it's huntin' season
I hope you understand by now what I'm thinkin'
Get a bag of that dank, from the hemp and I'm steady drinkin'
Contemplatin' on what should I do
This nigga got G's, I'm talkin' about a hundred or two

Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
See, money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
For my stars, money makes the world go round
(talk)
This song is about a nigga always trying to keep you down you know
Now touch that
We made something from nothing
And vowed to never tear it apart
We turned the street hustle into an art
That would quickly change life forever for us
No more riding bikes or catching the bus
We on the roll up, money to fold up
With Cognac and cooked yola
Got the neighborhood about to blow up, but hold up
I see this van sittin', this old cat in a fitted
Trying to get your little homey tore up
Yo bruh, we ain't working on this corner take your ass on, dog
Before you make me feed your ass to my hogs you fucking faggot
I know you want to catch me with this bag so you can hide me
Or with my .44 so you can 45 me
You put this shit off in our neighborhoods and sweat us
And when you finally catch us up you give us letters
A cold thing
Just when a nigga reach his goal, mayne
You hand him a case for easing out the dope game
And I'm...
**Chorus**
Watching us unfold with the times
He don't really want a nigga to climb
You'd rather separate me from my family forever
Instead of trying to keep us together
You motherfuckers would rather keep me down...
So what I rap about these streets
That don't make me be no less of a man
Than a person that do work with his hands
It's bad enough I gots to deal with all these pressures that stand
You tryin' to make me stray away from my plan
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm from the gutter, where all we had was one another
No wheat bread to butter, from one bed to the other
All uncles and no brother
My mother's at work
My grandfather was my dad
And when he died it hurt
And as I hold back the tears my eye-wells swell
I been praying for heaven, I been living in hell
And these niggas in my age group is dead or either locked up
The bitches no better, they smoked out or knocked up
But I still love my hood, that's where it started
Ain't no hard feelings, we partners nigga, regardless
That's why you always see me coming around
Cause I could never turn my back on my town
But still I'm...
**Chorus(2x)**
Watching us unfold with the times
He don't really want a nigga to climb
You'd rather separate me from my family forever
Instead of trying to keep us together
You motherfuckers would rather keep me down...
Money never changed me
Money changed the people around
Now they plot to try to keep me down
But still I rise like yeast
Your whole conversation bout B
Fuck a nigga talking bout me, I'm a G
The realest motherfucker ever done it
You can't continue to pimp me and y'all eat from it
So fuck every soul who ever felt like I owed
Them a god damn dime, or a god damn rhyme or a god damn chance
Motherfucker you sad
You a grown ass man, holding a nigga hand
Now get out on your own, stop depending on your homes
To chuck you a bone, and stop throwing stones
And that goes for everybody thinking it's them
Fuck you, you and you
Her, him and him
Tom, Dick and Kim
All of y'all stand accused
Saying fuck to me
And I done bought your children's shoes
I'm...
**Chorus(2x)**
Watching us unfold with the times
He don't really want a nigga to climb
You'd rather separate me from my family forever
Instead of trying to keep us together
You motherfuckers would rather keep me down...
Alright, let's ride...
I spent my day right off a Holloway, broke and disgusted
Without enough money to buy food but I'm smoking so fuck it
Hit the schoolyard, no report card because I'm larger than life
Clothes smokey, eyes shining, 'cause I'm high as a kite, fuck it
High school teachers I'm a man of respect
South Acres baby gangsta, I'm demandin' respect
Fuck the school vice principal, he shife and I'm leaving
Told my mama about my dope case and my mama believed him
Now my daddy got a problem 'cause I'm home for vacation
Strong and shy with a fucked mind, let him know what they facing
Got the doctors who done studied this, but niggas with doubt
Probably take a shrink a lifetime to figure him out (Trust me)
I seen the same thing flash change violent
And motherfuckers caught in that chain remain silent
So why you figure I've be standing here shaking
Because the devils is close to taking me but I can't face him (oooooh)
My soul is controlled by the blessings of God
Still scared to walk to first ground 'cause the devil's in charge
Somebody help the lost souls find savior
'Cause I'm standing on the cut with a Tec-9 for the hoe behavior
They want to take me out the game like Rider
But you youngstas better stop and peep game because my game wider
I send this out to those who thought that they come
Cold as fuck when it came to the game and my game done
Southside south south side; southside south south side
Southside south south side; southside south south side
You know what I'm saying
It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody
Everybody forgotten about me..
Will I ever, ever, EVER, be free?
Huh, uh, HUH?

Just when they thought it was safe
I picked up the phone and called it a day
I bought a new car, caught a new case, fuck it
The harder I walk, the ground shall shake
Stomping, the harder I march, the ground will break
I am, groundbreakin, like an earthquake, heh-heh
Yeah, I run this shit, but I'll tackle it
You want me to break it down, I'mma fracture it
My mind is wandering, I can't find it
But ten times outta ten, my mind on the money
Bandana around my head like I know karate
And I'll wax a nigga ass like Mister Miyagi
And it ain't over 'til the fat lady sang
And that bitch got a whole lot more weight to gain
And call me by my new name
(...What is that?) "Featuring Lil Wayne"

"It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody
Everybody forgotten about me..
Will I ever, ever, ever, be free?
Huh, uh, HUH"
(My nigga, Featuring Lil Wayne...
Came here to fuck with me tonight, shawty)

I am as, real as they come as hard as they get
They go to talking off the wall I put a par' in they shit
I'm the o-riginal gangsta, I'll tell you how I do it
I take niggas from the jump when they step to me with that bullshit
I am a fool, bitch, a native H-Town from the south side of Houston
You're tuned to the sounds of a nigga, who don't give a fuck
Cause one way or the other
I'm gon' still get mine, play the game, motherfucker
The truth is in the building and I came tonight
And I done sold so many records, change my name to life
Cause I can breathe into the hood, make it feel my pain
And even though they try to change me, I remain the same
And even if I did have that chrome-plated grill on my shit
I come from out the motherfucking bricks
Now, never forget, where I come from, son
I'm respected in these motherfucking streets I run
I'm Face

"It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody
Everybody forgotten about me..
Will I ever, ever, ever, be free?
Huh, uh, HUH"
(MY, NIGGA)

It's Bun B, the nigga Mr. Swisher, and Mr. Flows
Mr. Brick, Mr. Killer Grams Nigga, Mr. 'BOWS
Mr. Slab, Mr. Candy Paint, nigga Mr. Dough
And Mr. Eighty-fo', hating ho, even yo' sister know
When I hits the do', motherfuckers drop and kiss the flo'
Light bulb flow, I glass shatter, transistors blow
I'm the shit fo' sho! Roll wit it, bitch or {?} worm
I'm hot in this heat, a head shot'll keep your perm burned
It's my turn, I earn stripes and paid dues so
Don't be surprised if I'm in a trap or own a new show
I don't dry snitch, sneak diss or even backdo'
Balla block, a short stop or drop down in Fat, ho
(What!) I don't keep it a hunnid (huh), I keep it a thousand
I'm hood, so I rep the hood, direct from the public housing
(Mayne!) I got it crunk like Obama in a 'Fesco
Nuttin less than the best, ho
Nigga, let's go it's U..

"It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody (muthafuckin G..)
Everybody forgotten about me.. (K, fo' LIFE!)
Will I ever, ever, ever, be free? (Long Live the Pimp!)
Huh, uh, HUH"
It's been a long time coming but now I'm back at it
Flipping the script, from balling back to gansta rap classics
You know that shit that hit the hood and upset it
If real niggas respect it, the squares gon' rep it
I done came in here to bring it to you
The uncut version of ganstarism with the nickel painted Ruger
Quick to cock it on you, spark light in your eyes
The unexpected is happening to you now nigga, surprise!
Who is it? (Face, marchin', mobbin')
You said it one more time (Face Mob)
What else? (we keep you)
Now motherfuckers lay it down
The ruler's back, cause it's too many pussies out here
Making bullshit records and ruining rap
I gotta check this whole game; niggas out here listening
To these record label bitches instead of doing they thing
I'm a real nigga, a street nigga till it's done with
And I could never let you talk me into dumb shit
Like selling out to move a few more units
Just keep me in the ghetto cause the hood stay truest
You fuck around and cross the other side of the track
Catch you a brick then realize that you can't come back
I'mma stick to the facts
Fuck it if I don't go two
The homies know that Face stay true
And though I've got more muscle, my sounds don't change
Been the same ever since I stepped in the game
Now, this is for these niggas switchin' they shit
Prostituting theyself, trying to get them a hit
Suck a dick

You a sellout nigga
Bow down nigga before they fuck around and find you face down in the river
Talk down nigga and I'mma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga
You a sellout nigga and I'mma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga

Fo sho I talk a lot of shit but you can bet that I'm the nigga
Out here backing it up, while you acting it up
I can prove you ain't as real as what you claiming to be
You the king on your block, but you ain't shit in DC
You ain't shit off in the city of Chi
You ain't shit off in the Do It or Die
They want to skin you alive
Out here talking like you carrying arms
We don't shoot at motherfuckers, we done flipped the script to carrying bombs
I can end it for niggas out here who's hard in the booth
Any city I can hit the hood cause Scar is the truth
I know so much about these streets that I can walk them asleep
You can't tell me shit about your hood, I walked on your beat
I know your whole life story, plus I've seen for myself
You got caught smoking dope, that's why they sent you to jail
Had you locked up with wet backs, only real niggas suffer set backs
90 days and I ain't goin' to respect that
And you can sniff a snitch a mile away
Fuck him in his ass and feed him dick, a pound a day


I've got niggas I was raised with who know who I am
Lil' Brad from out of South Acres, prone for scams
Never ducked the motherfucker, I was down for the dirt
Got respect from older cats cause I was down for the work
When Fondren had its Great Skate I'd roll to the club
Drunk off the bird with thumbtack holes in my glove
Stood in the corner waiting for bullshit to jump
And in the event it jumped you saw a fool get stomped
There it is, can't get this shit no realer than that
Had a super boxing game, but now I'm peeling your cap
I done been in fist fights with niggas twice my size
Got an incredible record, 27 and 5
And the 5 losses I got, I had to redeem 'em
So he had to fight me everytime I seen him
Ain't no pussy in me, I've been for real before this rap shit
I study MCs, that's how I know you hoes is plastic
So-a, shake your ass and I'mma tell 'em the truth
Fabricate your bumps and bruises homey, do what you do
Just remember who for real when they tell you they real
I survived the game of life nigga, fuck some skills
(Scarface)
Hotel, motel, deep up in a ho's tail
Pussy smellin sweeter than a half a key a dope smell
Knock that top back, told her I'd be right back
Nigga where your wife at, y'all niggas don't like that
I bring a bitch the rough shit, you be on some love shit
Kiss and hold and hug shit, she be wantin thug dick
You winin, and dinin, puttin all ya time in
I be into windin, knockin out the linen
Silk pink panties, but she can't understand me
I be buyin condoms, you be buyin candy
She love you, lust me, gansta shit, it must be
All the while you spoilin that bitch, so thinkin 'fuck me'
Hard for you to see that, cause you be on that weak rap
"Ay, can I get some roses please?", nigga where your 'G' at
A gentleman, fuck that, wearin suits, what's that?
You hit the ho she lay there, I hit the bitch she fuck back
Makin voices, noises, voices and noises (moaning)
But when she do, I send her home to you
Pussy hole swole up, everytime she roll up
(Hook - Devin)
(Nasty) I'm slippin in and out ya girl
(Nasty) Pussy all around the world
(Nasty) Stickin my dick up in and out ya girl
(So nasty) Pussy all around the world
(Devin)
Now I admit, I didn't put my prick up ya gal
She saves her pussy for you, she's just my dick sucking pal
She tells me her problem, I like to listen and learn
And I don't mind because she's always got a Swisher to burn
And a six-pack, I sit back, chill while she drives
With her skirt pulled down and her panties to the side
Wanna smoke, what's up, open up the glove compartment
Grab the Swisher, kiss her, get my lighter and spark it
Don't know how she do it nigga but when she be drivin
She be slobbin and bobbin while she's givin me noggin
And I've been, tryin to tell myself to chill
But I find myself just takin the wheel
(Hook) 2x
(Too $hort)
She followed me to the bathroom, and I ain't have to pee
I'm at the club tryin to do this little nasty freak
I met last week, you know the panties drop quick
She suck dick with two hands and a whole lotta spit
Average niggas get nervous around the bitch
Lick between her legs and run circles 'round her clit
Fall in love, she'll make your mind a wreck
When she lay on her back, and put her legs behind her neck
Sperm drinker, come in her mouth, she keeps suckin it
It's too sensitive, have a nigga sayin
'fuck this shit, bitch, can I have my dick back'
You don't wanna hit that, you don't wanna be inside that kit-cat
She's too nasty, but I like that
Pussy have you right back, fuck where your wife's at
It's hard for you to fight that
Long throat, nut-gobblin bitch with a tight cat
Gettin head in a white 'Lac, bitch
(Hook) 4x
Just waking up I gotta thank god
Fired up a square, that's how my day starts
Early mornin' buzzin' got me lookin' at life
Outside I see movin' bitches look at the lights
It's just another Saturday it seems like
Got dressed and hit the corner with my team right
Smoke it, roll it up and pass it around
Now I'm stoned and my ass is barely draggin' the ground
No sooner than you think I would've thought of
A cop walks over, never saw him
"Excuse me, mister officer man, I wasn't tryna disrespect"
And started coughin' again
Eyes red as a bandana
And one time heavy on his antenna
At his request they sent a squad car
And then they put my black ass behind bars

Oh, sittin' on this concrete couch, just waitin'
For the judge to say that I'm gon' be free today
Oh, sittin' in this concrete box, just sayin'
It's been a shitty day, can't find no other words to say
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fingerprinted and gettin' booked in
They fed a nigga , so I took ten
Cause I'm knowing that I'll be sittin' here the whole night
Empty trunk tank, it's finna be a cold flight
I finally come up on some housin'
Old celly, so I'm bettin' me a thousand
And plus I got a bottom bunk pass
Boss came in with his punk ass
Talkin' to a nigga like it's date time
Askin' where I'm from, I'm from H-town
Niggas askin' me what I'm in for
Nosy motherfuckers want some info
I tell him, "Dog, I ain't done shit
You know these redneck crackers think they run shit."
It's lights out, I tie my mat down
Chuck it on the rack and stretch my ass out

Oh, sittin' on this concrete couch, just waitin'
For the judge to say that I'm gon' be free today
Oh, sittin' in this concrete box, just sayin'
It's been a shitty day, can't find no other words to say
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's court call in the halls
Strip a nigga down to his balls
Bare-butt, naked in my tennis shoes
The nighttime sergeant want an interview
They push us out like livestock
"Ain't no talkin' while I'm talkin', this is my block"
I finally get to see me a judge
I'm a black man, so she got a grudge
Old bitch full of race hate
And a nigga quick to represent the gray state
I ain't got a lawyer, I don't need one
Give me thirty days, you get three one
I ain't tryna piss in a jug, bitch
Just because I'm black, I get fucked with
Babe, if I had been a white dude
I'd have never been arrested, look at Michael
And even if I swam like a fish, though
They still would've threw me in the Crisco
And fried a nigga's ass in some hot grease
I'm just tryna get my ass out the hot seat
It's been a long time comin
But now I'm back up in this bitch to hit these niggas with this gangsta shit
I keep the strong rhymes runnin
My shit don't switch, I'm 10 years in, and ain't changed one bit
It's all about the real, nigga
I keeps it real, nigga
And won't sell out for Girbaud or Tommy Hilfiger
Fucker, I figure niggas wanna see
The side of society they don't see on TV
So when I bring the shit, I bring the shit like I seen it
And when I scream the shit, I sing the shit like I mean it
No secret, these muthafuckas figure I'm a threat
Cause I ain't fallin short to the traps the demon set
Now sweat, cause now I got my head in your books
And when I think 'cracker', my definition read 'crook'
Now look, we're livin under laws that they set
Back then we were treated like dogs and wasn't shit
And slowly but surely the shit changed
From they fault, but if you black, then you get blamed
A damn shame, that means this muthafucka's one-sided
And blacks, we get lost in the sauce because we unguided
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
Get what they can get and rip they assholes apart
They smart

They smart, man
(Those guys...)
You niggas better watch yo ass
(..they're the bad guys)
Them bastards they smart, man
(Those guys...)
It's up to us for how long we gon' last
(..they're the bad guys)

I declare an all-out attack
Let's take our minds behind enemy lines, so we can see how the demon acts
And how he set us up for failure in the first place
And why the fuck did we just settle for a birthday
You see, I'm hip to the games that you run
Like the games you run unfair, we can get no fair one
Cause we was dealt the bad hand from the jump
And we can't deal, so we jack and get drunk
And might end up locked down or six feet
But in these streets a muthafucka gots to eat
You can't sleep, cause if you're caught sleep, you gots to pay
And just like everyone left you got your day
And these days were meant for all to keep tryin
But we can't relate, so we fall and keep dyin
Open your muthafuckin eyes who your enemy
The muthafuckas dyin or the muthafuckas killin you?


You put your crack on my table
I turn my axe on my neighbor
And my back to my Savior
You had me thinkin you were almighty
But to the Almighty you're just a man that's really all tiny
The Maker will open up our minds to see
That Heaven ain't a place here on Earth, you gots to leave
And once we leave, we stand between eternal peace and eternal pain
And you the Beast shall meet eternal flame
So let it rain, wash away up all my bad things
And put some laughter in our hearts again
Now black men, stand up, let's come together as a whole race
And don't be fed up by the old days
They try to do us like the Indians, killin us like wild beast
And show more love for the Chinese
And kept us trapped up in a small room
And made decisions on our life we accepted that left us all doomed
They sabotaged and they camouflaged
But if these niggas game to crank up some shit, then I be down to ride
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
The only way to beat em is to think, cause they smart
They smart
Miss me? Wished me?
Well I am done now
Won't be coming back again
I'll let you run wild!
Smile for the camera
Pose for a snap shot
This will be the last tape
I'm about to cash out
Fun while it lasted
Maybe in the next life
I can be ya girlfriend
'cus i don't need an ex wife
They tell me that beauty's only skin deep
Inside empty, pissed off simply
Cause I will not apologize
For nothing I done did wrong
Bitch you done chose me, you are gonna win some
And lose some, that's just a couple thang
Fine if it works
If it don't, that's another ring
Sold to the highest bidder, my nigga
Ho had a nerve to tell a mama I hit her
Never had to, that is not true
Now I got another boo thang, that is not you!

Let us fly to the heart
It's a fight for love
? ?
I don't know, I don't know
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she going, where she going?
It feels like I'm in pain
I'm lonely, I'm lonely

I don't wanna play the blame game
Nah, that's not me
I can pack my own bags
No use tryna stop me
I got my mind made
A spade is a spade, ma'
You took what we had
And made it bad, what's the spade now?
Relationship is gone
Ain't no heart here
Just a ice box where it was
If it's not clear
Let me make it for you
We are over, find another
Ain't no use in trying to reason
With this stupid motherfucker
I never shoulda trust her
It was dirty from the jumpstreet
You wanted the rapstar
You ain't really want me
Settle for a anybody
Shit you done was idiotic
You thought I was broke, huh?
Bitch I'm gettin plenty money
That shit is really funny
You gave me the 10 count?
You threw in the towel on me
Then brought that Benz out
You at your friends house
Booed up with some dude?
With pictures on your instagram
Smiling with it, fuck you

Let us fly to the heart
? ?
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she going, where she going?
It feels like i'm in pain
I'm lonely, i'm lonely

Hey it's a new me
I hope you found new you
And got your shit together
I ain't mad baby, do you
There's plenty other dudes to fall in lust with
For holidays, or any other days
That you put yo trust in
You're a must win
Losing ain't a option
You don't wanna work
You wan't the finer things, stop this
You ain't no better than the next bitch begging
Can't pour piss out of them boots you put your legs in?
And even wanna fairytale wedding
Like a nigga wanna wife you
And I don't even like you
Love gone, how am i gonna write a love song?
I'm wishing you the best, but he fucked you with a glove on!
Girl gone, how nice of you to stop by
Bitch that you accused me of sleeping wit is my wife now
Let me be nice now
Here's the introducion
Misses Jordan
He's just stupid bitch that i was fucking

Let us fly to the heart
? ?
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she going, where she going?
It feels like i'm in pain
I'm lonely, i'm lonely
Is there anybody out there...

I swear I feel so all alone, back down on my knees again
Hoping you can keep me strong, cause I can't hardly sleep tonight
I took too many sleeping pills, I drunk too many Miller Lites
And I can feel the Reaper near, so please forgive me for my sins
I am just another man, sorry for the pain that I've caused
I know you'll understand, but these demons are driving me insane
I've been going mad, probably oughta blow out my brains
Cause I'm hurting bad but I'm fighting... blast, on the other day
These problems got me using more drugs, along with the other things
I'm slowly fading into my thoughts, (come against me, bring it on!)
And I'm drifting in and out of space, and I don't believe I'm waking up
With the alcohol, demerol, drifting into another world
With the sunshine shinin, and I think I'm finna url
Momma, can ya look at me? This ain't what I used to be
Tomorrow, I'll be somebody else, cause I ain't been me
And I can't seem to shake these things, I'll put that there on every thing
The more I try to figure me out, is like the more I've changed
But my childhood was fucked up - raised rowdy by a single moms
She told me my daddy didn't give a fuck, she ain't let him do his job
Separate the family, and I don't know my next of kin
These days in these fucked up ways, who the fuck are them?
My daddy had three other kids, but I ain't never seen him so
Ain't no sense in coming around now, you ain't been here before
It's sad but I ain't feelin him, my whole life's been a fuckin maze
And when I tried to locate my siblings, they were gone away
Lost inside they other things, fucked me then, fucked me now
Quick to tell me "Show you some love" nigga show you how?
Ain't no love I'm feelin here, I ain't never felt this vile
Momma - did you really love me, or was I just a child?
Sad on the outside, I knew you seen it in my face
I wasn't really happy here, but I was forced to lead the way
Copped me a Chevrolet, drift away to the other side just to think
If I get to see Heaven, I can thank you for the ride
And thank you for my other kids and even though
They mommas won't admit that they can't make it but bad
Low on the child support - always been bad boo, tryna make me out to be
The bad guy that I really ain't, bitches quick to hassle me
Cause I don't see my kids enough, but I make the time to pick 'em up
But you find somethin to stick in my face - it ain't me fuckin up
It's bad enough, face to face, hoes who wanna catch a case
So bad they'll try to give me they baby - and what takes the cake
Is the whole ward is fucking her, daddy know where the weakness at
And you spoke lies to ya old mans eyes, how could you sleep wit that?
Jeopardizing everything, desperate, searching for larger life
Sacrificing the entire family, with no regards to Christ
Funny how people look at life - can take this shit for granted, right?
But then reality strikes, and changes things overnight
I thank the Lord for watching over me, though I'm prone to doin wrong
I repent religiously, hoping that the weak get strong
When the heat gets on {*wind blowing*}
Hoping that the weak get strong, when the heat get's on

Ya know... it's three different... stages of life...
Either, you're headed into a storm... ya in a storm...
Or ya just got out of a storm... (yeah) think about it...
*music until fade*
News clip: "I got my double-barreled shotgun, the one I call Molly
And I crawled out of the house Army-style, with the rifle cradled in both arms
Alright, I said, just hold it right there, I said 'don't move'
And I walked up on him with the shotgun
And I cocked both barrels of the shotgun on him cause I had double-oughts in it
And (Gunshot)"
