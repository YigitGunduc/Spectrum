Chickens in the sink
Crack on the stove
Triple beam for the weight
Cut the middle man tryna get 8 white bitches
Snorting off the plate coke from Colombia
Riding round in the Benz looking like a trap star
Flipping raw day and night
Tryna get my money right naw I ain't living rite
Fucking bitches all night kick 'em out the next day
Everyday is pay day
Hit me with a half bring it back in two days
Living in Cali by the ocean
Condo got em open
Long dick stroke em
I send 'em to the husband he over there fussing
I'm over here fucking no loving
Puffing on heavenly rock star 70's
Slim pants ripped jeans Jeremy Scott wings
Fucking heavily counting up cream
Rolling on beans disobedient with trees
Tatted from neck to ear bitches they want to stare
Macking with hoes as I pose
Hand in my draws henny out my pores
As I pour hit the blunt too much you on the dash as I pass
(Hook)
Coke and White Bitches
Coke and White Bitches
Just Coke and White Bitches
Coke and White Bitches
Coke and White Bitches
Just Coke and White Bitches
Coke and White Bitches
Coke and White Bitches

Different money different days
On my hip I got that cake
Close your mouth if it ain't about 'cane
Over the stove mixing
Hitting swishers
Red paint tripping, blue seat sack tripping
Coke I hold tripping
I'm pimping hat tilting
No limping fuck sipping
I'm shitting on you niggas
Seven figures go figure
Surrounded by white bitches
Slipping off wedding rings
She do her one two thing
Cali with the pool in the back
Got these niggas backs
Meet me by the border ounce to a key
Flying over seas
Korean imported extorted these niggas
Smoking out the bong
Lighting up the spliff Basel on my wrist
Bought me a six pop the willy on that bitch
She snorting off my dick put her on the strip
Flipping my bread triple my spread nigga bring it back
Triple my racks bricks in my backpack
What up to Troy Ave
Still pouring up deuce in the triple cup
Purple lean or that yellow tuss
(Hook)
Do my thang let my nuts hang
Girls come back like boomerangs
Pretty flowers whens it spring
But fall off when its winter time
Sip Henny, not wine, boy get on your death rhyme
Make a milli off one rhyme, pass the mic, ima shine
Got my shit on rewind, cold white bitches from the show
Mosh Pit, better watch the toes airplane on leather floors
Tell the pilot where to go, dark tints, lay low
Can't see my new ho, double debt like two shows
Fuck a nine five cop one mo'ain't fuckin' front do

See me in the car bitch going fast
If you gotta shorty, then smash that
Where the licks at? Lets hit that
Mossberg shotty saying get back

Everybody need handouts
Niggas hold they fam out
Panamera is blacked out
Paper chase might pass out
Niggas change my peso
God love ya' haters
You niggas made me greater
Ya'll niggas Stuck in the same place
Brook ass elavators, Magic Johnson scales
Playing for the Lakers, faster than a Maverick
Niggas hustle backwards , four five give you static
Leave yo' body tragic
DJ Nick, Marino Gang

Balls in your mouth and your hands on my coat
Don't need you touching me I might go broke
Don't need you fucking me you not that dope

If you keep on popping its popping outside
Give me a reason to scare you tonight
Act like yo' ass got some sense

Before they end up in a meeting with the bottom of my temp

Pop pussy she touch toes
Bounced ass like a pogo

Name tatted' on her back
Flip a hunnid' for a stack
For these racks, make it clap
On the highway, getting neck in a Cadillac
All these bitches on my dick

She pushin' over I tell that hoe no that shit was over
My costra nostra, there's no one colder, she hold a boner
From Minnesota, Minneapolis, I trap a bitch
Trafficking weed, with shopping sprees that's all she needs
MDM, remy, weed 
Keep a  fast life still sippin' lean
Counting green, no if or buts, no in-betweens

My bitch titties is counterfeit
But trick niggas love her
See her pussy calls, money clips
Watch out for them jump outs

In the kitchen whipping, them pots out
Big gwap in my pot house
Safe locked, I'm stocked out

From Baltimore, where the murder's raising
Passing out T's, in the morning, fiends shaking

Steady striving, hard work pay off at the end
Hard work pay off at the end!
