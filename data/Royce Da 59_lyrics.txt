You will not be able to stay home, brotha
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar keeps firing
Ohh, we in the war, where butterflies keep dyin' (ahh)

I'm a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didn't do this, where in the fuck would you be at?
See there's a difference between us, what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis, I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtering mics
I'm tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh, all you niggas my little rapper babies
Y'all my children, y'all bit my shit and contracted rabies
Don't you grade me next to these rappers, baby, that's degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions
I'm skippin' class to be fascinatin'
My pen is like Big Ben, this shit's just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me, I just decapitate him
I hate congratulating these has-beens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I bring Attica to these patterns, and here's my battle cry

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar is firing
Ohh, we in the war, where butterflies keep dyin' (ahh)

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

Hold up, wait a minute
Guess what I'ma never do? Show so much respect to you
That I feel like we're friends, so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone who's not as smart as you
Gas you up and tell you somethin' you never knew
Always stay professional, you always gon' make revenue
Don't let people next to you that don't want the best for you
It's completely normal to hold on to a regret or two
I do what I wanna do, they do what I let them do
Everything these niggas be sayin' is a fuckin' lie
It's nothing I can say to you that is realer
Remember when you praisin' the butterfly
Don't you ever disrespect the fuckin' caterpillar

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

You're looking at Attila, the psychopathic killer, the caterpillar
Don't tell me when I'm supposed to rap until
Especially when your favorite rapper ain't even half as ill
A savage still, the track's a banana peel, attack of the silverback gorilla
You're havin' a little trouble fathomin' this is actually happenin'
Like Anderson Silva back when he snapped his shin in half
And then had the shit hangin' by a flap of skin
After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again
Pad to pen I’m batty like eyelids when they're blinkin' a lot
You copy me, but you're not
You can't be butterflies, my offsprings are just moths
I see that thing I'ma squash it and rip the wings of it off
So ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off of the wall
Set the sprinklers off like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah
'Till the shingles come off the roof we'll shout at the ceiling
Slaughterhouse in the building, middle fingers aloft
Say what I think when I rhyme, in ink-pen I talk
And the language I speak is my mind
Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like it's King of the Dot
A singular thought I think of will help you distinguish apart
The frauds from the cream of the crop
(Wait a minute) Hold up like a flashcard
Damn dawg, is that copyin' or payin' homage?
It's sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler
My dad is your grandfather, I'll have to re-hatch on you
Come back as a black wasp, half yellow jacket, you can't swat a
Sasquatch dancing on top of an ant trample it and stomp it
Smash it and stand on it, dammit, I can't stop it
The rap is a vag' and I'm goin' in like a tampon in this bitch
It's a manslaughter
Stampin' out grasshoppers, you can't be no Rap Gods
In fact you're exact opposites, you make a wack song
And can't hold a candle but even Daniel-san whacks off
You jack-offs need to come to grips like a hand job
The boom bap is coming back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one, but my pencils are number twos
'Cause that's all I dos with 'em, poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when I'm droppin' a deuce
And when I'm producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
'Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen 'em
Bitch, shit is real like I pooped Jerusalem
I'm 'bout to go spin another cocoon
Then I'm cuttin' you from your mother's womb
Then I'm flushin' you!
"Cruising down the river; dancing till your feet got numb; cool summer breezes blowing through your hair as you stood gazing down the river in anticipation of the thrill of the dizzying rides at the amusement park—ah, memories of Bob-Lo Island."
All is your world ain’t nothing but a squirrel tryna get a nut. Just jealous of everybody that’s headed out on that Bob-Lo boat. It is the perfect weather and the perfect time to enjoy a few snacks. Aw, man, I wish I was joining you—a little cheese and crackers, a little Cana wine, a little Riunite on ice, some Harvey’s Bristol Cream—but let’s do this, only on Smooth FM. 

Nothing compared to our family trips
My uncle shook hands with a manly grip
All this hand-me-down-shit; I had had an uncanny fit
All the gangstas I had in my family had me anti-bitch
My granddaddy mistress caught the business from my granny fist
That was back ‘fore I was born
Pop told stories ’bout it that would last for hours-long
And as a family, we was just so happy
When him and mama got along on the Bob-Lo boat
Uh, on our way to that black amusement park
Wood rollercoasters, crack sold on plastic scooter cars
Uh, smoking grass at the vintage food court
Broken glass, waiting on you on the swimming pool floor
I came across my identity on the Bob-Lo boat
That’s where I lost my virginity, no condom, though
That’s when paranoia hit me like when superstition does
Left my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was
Parties on the way to the island would be the livest, though
First time big bro hit the bottle was on the Bob-Lo boat
But neither one of us knew that we would both
Grow up and turn to alcoholics, though, the Bob-Lo boat

Hey, hey, hey, lil’ Craig, come here. Aye, hit this, nigga. Nigga, don’t worry ’bout what the fuck it is, just drink!

Yeah yeah, yeah
Some of my better times, I shared with you
I shared with you, yeah
Shit, all of my better days, I shared with you
I shared with you, shit
And now I gotta wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Shit, stuck inside a rat race (fuck)
Rat race (fuck, fuck)
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up again
Stuck inside this rat race (fuck)

Yeah, look
Twist the cap, lift the bottle back, swig it
Dig it, ten-inch rims on my mama’s Civic
Ten-inch woofers in the trunk, to be specific
They bump, rattle the license plate, plus the windows tinted
Don’t even give a fuck that it’s dented, bitch, I’m the man now
I’m rolling, driving it slow as if it’s stolen
Piling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser
Calling up hoes like we was Jodeci, let’s check her
Double D’s like double-deckers, I wanna sex her
But these keys don’t come with game on how to finesse her
Five semesters left until college, I’m under pressure
I’m not a real nigga ’til I undress her, I gotta ‘press her
This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
Nowadays, I often yearn to press the
Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
My real-life trauma plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of
Jermaine Lamarr but that’s insane, it couldn’t be further left of
The truth is that my new shit slap, you never heard it better
Give me a sec, I murder sectors, prefer to let ya
See it rather than say it, but it spill out, I gotta chill out
Say “Fuck the world” and never pull out
We had no Bob-Lo boat but I could note
Those times is like a Bible quote
BC, before cell phones, the first time I would smoke
I was six years old, but that’s for another chapter
That’s for another story, to God be the glory
I made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe
With my son in Tanzanian sunrays thinking ’bout them days
Thinking ’bout them days

This is; 808-Ray
Nigga don't worry about what the fuck it is, just drink
Yeah! I don’t know what else to say
I can’t, I can’t think of nothin'
I’m stumped, here we go!
On your feet! Stand up! Everybody hands up!
Uh, man, I don't know man
Every time I go to think of something played out to say
You already said it

I ain't callin' names 'cause all of y'all the same
Plus I'm the king, all my past pain all done changed up
All these plains, all these lames, since the Slaughter's came up
'Cause they know their hands tied, feet ball and chained up
Niggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent
Because of my relationship with Marshall
Used to make me a little partial, but here's the brain fuck
We the same, 'cause
I'm probably 'bout to fall out with a young buck
While I attempt to fuck the fuckin' game up
Bitch, splat! Only thing I fear in here is chit-chat
You are hearin' bars like your ear against a Kit Kat
Shady guys like the Navy, try us, wavey bye-bye
Maybe my Glock can turn your top to Baby's Maybach
My shit is parvo, literally sick
Trust me, nigga, it's ugly to kill; the thing is, the bigger I get
The more disgustin' and fuckin' disfigured it gets
Niggas expect me to go pop, oh, stop
Y'all about the Champagne, I'm about the toast, I
Only fuck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
Niggas that'll smoke you while you starin' in your postbox
Only incense he enlightens when he's thinkin'
While that sinks in, I got a Brinks ink pen
I'm back! Motherfucker, notice the flyness on the cover
Of the XXL, I'm back from the dead
Like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers
How y'all realer? If I said it, I did it
If I didn't, I seen it first-hand like a card dealer
Give up the throne: your lease up; I am the Mona Lisa
That decoded Da Vinci Code, you throwin' your piece up
Is a waste of fake like a phony B-cup
Makin' the mistake was like my only teacher
Wait 'til they get a load of me, 'cause—

I've got Guccis on my feet, diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist, bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk, models in the front
Bottles in the club, but I don't give a fuck
But y'all already said that

'Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block, psyche!

When I stand up in this booth, niggas notice it
Sittin' on the same boat that Noah built
Floatin' on the same water Moses split
Poetry in motion, but we sittin' on your grave site: overkill
Aren't you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet
Real dudes move in silence, like a mute drivin' a new hybrid
You dudes is too excited
You a dude that'd try to sue a dude that's suicidal
You will just be another victim
I'm like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie: I'm a little twisted
I roll like the end credits in movies, y'all just got scripted
Got y'all niggas' bitches bobbin' to this one when she wit' ya
When she with me, she bobbin', not vibin'
Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
I'm a serpent with a purpose
Havin' problems? Not a problem
I've encountered, I have found elephants, lions, clowns
Will jump through hoops like they workin' for the circus
If the fire 'round the circle's right in front of them, fire rounds
Pun intended, gun extended, what are you marks askin'?
Car's Aston, started as a hard-top and I saw past it
Since I decided to start class, this all black, all glass
Panoramic roof been gettin' marked absent
I authorize my own all-access
Your bitch a whore, I'm a catch, she ball-catchin'
Her jaw's been broadcasted
All across the globe from the store to Japan
Her pussy need to be blocked and reported as spam
Interscope, I been this dope
Now sell it, my voicemail is full
Got bitches screamin' inside of envelopes
And they tryna mail ‘em to me
Tryna reach my phone, I don't know which one is harder:
Tryin' not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own

I've got Guccis on my feet, diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist, bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk, models in the front
Bottles in the club, but I don't give a fuck
But y'all already said that

'Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block, psyche!

Man, get the bozac!
We need to start bringin' that shit back (Mad flava!)
Man, fuck it, I'm 'bout to catch some wreck
(We in effect, money!)
Mad props to Royce for keepin' it real
On the strength, no diggity
I'm 'bout to go pull some hoes, get my mack on
Haters get the gas face!
I'm the verbal-spit Smith Wesson
I unload with sick spit
The quick wit could split a split-second
Bomb with a lit wick expression
You hear a tick tick then you testin'
My saliva and spit could split thread into fiber and bits
So trust me, I'm as live as it gets
Everybody claim they the best and they head the throne
Since B.I.G is gone, if you ask me, they "Dead Wrong"
My flow is hotter than the flash from the click
When the hammer slaps the bullet on the ass from the clip
You wind up in a room full of my dogs
I'll have you feeling like a fire hydrant in a room full of dogs
So come, come now, get pissed on, shitted on
Tough talk turns to, "Can't we all just get along"
You get blazed when the mic's off, shot when it's on
You probably ducked when they laid the gun shot in your song
My gun st-stutters when it speaks to you
Utter shit to repeat to you
Enough in the clip, to give a speech to you
Me and Premier, we kind of the same in ways
We both speak with our hands in dangerous ways
Rap now is a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques I'd probably rap circles around
I'm the next best to reach a peak formerly known
As the best kept secret, I guess that I just leaked it

"Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb"
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
"Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb"
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9

I'm a motherfuckin' star, I don't battle no mo'
I provide the gun clapping round of applause after your show
And we could go toe-to-toe 'cause they calling you hot
Stepping around all your punches like, "That's all you got?"
Everyday I'm meeting somebody and all of they peeps
Quick to shake a nigga's hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitches, I be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at me, batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since that I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice: quit talking, it's over
I was knockin' niggas out when you was knocking sticks off of they shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so called vets
Niggas say I found God with the flow
Bring the police to the studio and bring the bomb squad to the show
Ain't a nigga touching mines
When you listen to my shit
You don't chew, you don't breathe
You don't miss a fucking line
Every time I spit, I tick to show you it's hot
Leave me in the deck too long, I blow up your box: boom

"Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb"
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
"Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb"
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
You will not be able to stay home brotha
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on scag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar keeps firing, ohh
We in the war, where butterflies keep dyin' (ahh)

I'm a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didn't do this, where in the fuck would you be at?
See there's a difference between us, what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis, I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtering mics
I'm tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh, all you niggas my little rapper babies
Y'all my children, y'all bit my shit and contracted rabies
Don't you grade me next to these rappers, baby, that's degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions
I'm skippin' class to be fascinatin'
My pen is like Big Ben, this shit's just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me, I just decapitate him
I hate congratulating these has-beens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I bring Attica to these patterns, and here's my battle cry

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

Hold up, wait a minute
Guess what I'ma never do? Show so much respect to you
That I feel like we're friends, so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone who's not as smart as you
Gas you up and tell you somethin' you never knew
Always stay professional, you always gon' make revenue
Don't let people next to you that don't want the best for you
It's completely normal to hold on to a regret or two

Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

Yeah, sold a quarter million records in my first week
And BET still don't wanna let me perform
Maybe it's 'cause my pigment, maybe I'm being ignant
Maybe it's all a figment of my imagination
And exaggeration exacerbates that I'm the illest, yes
How many are willing to kill us?
We the realest, that's why they feel us the best
But I don't give a fuck about this rap shit, not really though
Shittin' on a brother I should love, man, that's silly, yo
Fuck all this division and lyrical incision
It's time to unify cause hip-hop is beautiful, it's you and I
And it doesn't discriminate if you black or white
And you Christian or Muslim
It just love 'em and put nothin' above 'em
I just want to be remembered as a good person
Dispersin' a message of hope while the world worsen
And the media will still find a way
To turn us into clickbait and misquote
Wanna keep the peace, but if you do that
I'ma slit throats, sike, nah
"Logic's such a hypocrite", you can take a hike, nah
Right now, I'm here to talk about suicide and depression
Anxiety, mental health and all that other shit
You scared to mention
Yeah, I could talk about the millions I've amassed
But now just ain't the time or place
It's crazy how everyone so obsessed with my race
Cause I'm proud to be black, but matter fact
If it was flipped around and every time somebody asked me
What it was like to be a white rapper
"What's it like to be a white rapper, Logic?"
Oh and I was just like, just never talked about it like
"Man, it's just so great being a white rapper
White, white, white, white everything
White man—being white's so great—wow it's so great"
And then some brother was like, "Ayy, ain't yo daddy black?!"
And I was like "Oh shit!"
And the whole world be like "What, are you scared to be black?
Are you ashamed to be black?! Motherfucker, fuck you!
Fuck you, you piece of shit, mixed, biracial, fucking cunt"
(That's how they be)
Cole said fuck all this black and white, it's time to unite
Be who you are, identify as a star
Fuck all the jewelry and money inside of yo car
You still just a person and I'm still dispersin' these lyrics
Fuck the rap ego shit, just be a good person now that's the spirit
Shoutout to true emcees that love the culture
From Duckworth to Chano, Jermaine and Joey
And Aubrey and can't forget Bobby
To every emcee who knows that this is truly a way of life
And not just a hobby, uh, not just a hobby, uh
Not just a hobby, this is a way of life
Shout out to Bobby, the L-O-G-I-C, this shit a way of life
This shit a way of life, yeah
Look at you, no pleasure in creative thinking, because you don't think creatively anymore. The real joy of being a human being is to be able to use your mind in the manner that the Almighty God has designed the human mind to do

Tug of war and my mind's like a clash of the titans
Thoughts contrast so it's layers to my writin'
God fearin', but I'm Guy Fisher
Yeah, God hearin', but I'm gone fishin'
I'm an artist, drug dealer, foreign car keys
Drop jewels so these falcons like the Maltese
Birds in the trunk so these keys, now they homin'
Letters and numbers on the Coupe like it's Roman
Woo, all black like the omen
Kim said it, yup, BIG wrote it
So I'm feeling like a Greek God when I quote it
Lightyears ahead, but I was caught up in the moment
Moment of clarity, moment of silence
Burner on my waist, yet I'm saying stop the violence
Sitting on that white horse, look at prince valiant
Dad shakes his head cause the worst waste his talents
I philosophize for them Pitchfork scholars
Devil on my shoulder and the pitchfork follows
Poking at my problems, I know how to solve 'em
With a ski mask, automatic or revolver

A slave is one whose power and authority is ruled over by another and whose sphere of freedom is limited according to the wishes of a master. Your power and authority is ruled over by another and your sphere of freedom of activity is governed by the wishes of somebody else

Them niggas wanna see me runnin', they know I won't
They say misery loves company, no, I don't
Ain't got no time for you to try on no Manolo Blahniks
All I got time to do is go back in time and pose with the Unabomber
Just so I can go back in time a second time to photobomb it
I live by a code of demonic, Illuminati, Obama, Hovanomics
Hold up, hurdles in life, I hop in a Turbo and roll around 'em
I'm Doug E. Fresh in the flesh, I beat box
I boo-boo-du-du between the sheets to seek the G-Spot
I'm in bed with three naked ladies holding hands
I'm in bed with three major labels
And I ain't talkin' 'bout wearing clothing brands
Underground locomotive man
Putting on a global show that no promoter can
I philosophize with wise words from learned lessons
In my world mistakes turns to blessings
The hate turned to destiny
I'm saying Lord Jesus while the Lord's most gorgeous creatures take turns blessing me
I got your baby momma down on all fours
When drama comin', I'm all for it
If it ain't about the money please let this be your last question
You players can jump if you want, but you half-stepping like Paul George
I make the yay invisible in like a day or two
That's how the players do, my nigga, there's layers to it

First in science, first in technology, wealthiest country on Earth, most powerful country on Earth is twenty sixth in education. So you have all been taken and you don't even realize that you have been dumbed to the point where you are like sheep

Paranoid of poverty, hustle was the philosophy
I seen a kilo, I swear it became a part of me
Lie, cheat and steal, I had it mastered by my teens
Started hands on, a nigga still pulling strings
Hotel suites, straight selling nigga's dreams
Motel 6 as I let the beeper ring
Was a water boy, but balling always in my genes
Season ticket holder, nigga sitting with the team
Feds on the roof of the spreads in the juice
So suspicious of the cars, tuitions for the schools
Labeled a mastermind, I positioned every move
Shots fired, now the deposition from the crew
Smooth operation, but the money came in knots
Forty million there, I dare you tell me what I'm not
I own fifty homes and wanna get fifty more
Counting this fast money and fucking my bitches slow
Rozay
Yeah
I wanna share some shit with y'all
All truth, all truth

Uh, like I'm standing inside a Tabernacle
I promised not to lie in not one of these verses
I started out as a battle rapper
All I knew was Maxells, ADATs, DATs and gats
Uh, my name is Ryan Daniel Montgomery
Recovering alcoholic, I grew up on 9 Mile
Uh, I'm not a gangster, drug dealer or thug nigga
Just an MC who made a name with his rhyme style
Now, sometime around '95 I found my calling
And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
Now later on in the story, I tell you her significance
But now let's talk about me, specifically, three brothers and one sister see
My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
Hallelujah I'm the son of a addict
My addiction was music, all I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter
And listen to Redman and Heltah Skeltah

Aye y'all remember that one joint from the Heltah Skeltah album called?
Sean Price be like, "I'm not sure any—" yeah, that was my shit
I used to bump that shit all, day!
By this time I knew I wanted to be an artist
I didn't want to be anything else
You know, but my mom had plans for me
She wanted me to go to school, so you know

Uh, to make mom's happy, I took some general courses in college
Took the bus until I got hella bored with that
Because the bus stop I had to walk to
Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
Or meant for me to be laughing at God's geographical humor
As soon as I stepped foot in the open-mic, it was like a reunion
I was a shoe-in
I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
And that was back in like, let me see
'97, my girl was pregnant, hurdles was prevalent
And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
And the way he started blessing me, uh
I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice
Needless to say that December 29th was the day I became a believer in fate

Okay now it's December 28th, my day has gone great
Kino booked me a show under contract to do that night
I got a call from my girl's people saying she's in labor
In the hospital right now, 9th floor
I get on the elevator, elevator stops on the 5th floor
Elevator opens up, my uncle's standing there crying
Now I'm caught off guard, I'm like, "What the fuck?"

My uncle standing there like, "Ryan, they that way"
I walk out, I see my momma and that entire side of my family
Looking like there's some kind of drama happenin'
I said "What happened?" They like "Granny's been in a bad accident
And it ain't looking good", I'm like "Man, what?"
I'm having a baby four floors up before I froze up
I'm trying to figure out why the Lord chose us
Or maybe chose me, to ride in this emotional rollercoaster
My momma said "The baby here yet?" I said "Maybe"
She said, "Maybe? Baby, go see"
I walk away feeling like a good father, the same time as a terrible son
Get to my girl she 5 centimeters dilated so I waited
She got to get to 'bout nine 'til it's that time
And meanwhile I'm more popular in this hospital than the doctors
Nurses watching, whispering like "That's the one right there
Who got a lady in labor on 9 and another lady dying on 5"

By this time I don't even fuckin' remember that I got a show
Somebody had to remind me, the doors was already open at the venue
I got emotions runnin' every which way
All the nurses and stuff is like, "We'll keep you posted about the baby
We'll keep you posted about your granny."
I didn't like seeing my mama like that, so I had to get out of there

Yeah, I hit the stage at 11:50, killed it
I got off at about midnight with about six types
Of different emotions floatin' around inside me
Hopeless, tryna find me, hopin' in time God'll guide me
In the future, just as I was about to leave out
I saw Kino talkin' to Marshall and then he introduced us
We talked about collaboratin' and how chasin' this rap thing is aggravatin'
But I'll get back, I got the family waitin'
I get to skatin'
As soon as I get to the hospital, they tell me that my granny didn't make it
She just died, I'm feelin' helpless, it hurt me
On the flip side, my little boy is healthy in the nursery
I picked him up, looked in his eyes for the first time and just cried
Ain't no denyin' this is the power of God
I said, "I love you, Granny" and looked to the sky
Like even though he just got here, goodbye

This is how the story goes
Powerful day (now you know) powerful day (now you know)
Most significant day in my life
I mean aside from meetin' my man Marshall
My son bein' born and my granny dying on the same day
My grandma didn't live anywhere near that hospital
I learned a lot this day
I learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out
For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son, little Royce
It showed me that God is real, God is real
And you know what they say: God giveth, God taketh away
I'm legendary, legen-legendary, I'm le-le-legendary

The theme song to my supplier, plays in the key of a ki, I'm like a messiah
Crossed with The Wire, rapping around the Boardwalk Empire
Who brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter
I'm sick enough to take my life then take your life after
Don't take me light or play me light: we two of the same
God melted the Rubic's cube into fluid and threw it into my intuitive brain
I'm eating food for moving music in the gratuitous lane
Been through twice, now I'm running through until I'm through with the game!
You can find me under a black cloud: I'm a dark star
Only thing I hate worse than a mark, is a marked car
I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye, Tammy Terrell
You could put a face on my style; it'd be Sammy Cassell's
I switch the fire up like I am a tranny from Hell
What I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell
Cause it's the hammer, the cannon, you can dance with the shells
My pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail
I'm a heavyweight; I'm catastrophic
When I set it like Farenheit 9/11, meditate 'til the levees break
I tar and feather featherweights until my 'fetti straight
The MAC-11'll clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face
You ever looked inside some dying eyes?
You'll see surprise and realize there's no denying God
When was the last time that you heard that the "I" in "try"?
Ryan vibes like cyanide; I am proud
To say that I've evolved, there's only one "I" in defying odds
Small-time arrogance perishes every time to giant pride
Who y'all respect is probably cross-dressing
Your favorite MC can probably find himself, vibing to my Lost Sessions
I'm legendary

Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary

I got my noodles intact
You want support of Detroit rap, niggas can Google this gat
Cause we the reason why you eating, we put the food on the map
Right where the mitten is and you ain't do jack
Just who we kidding here? This here's a different year
So you shouldn't assume that I'm tryna measure up to you
When I tell you the ruler is back, in fact
As far as you new kids, what have you did?
I know that I've burnt some bridges in the past, but I'm happy to say that I built a new bridge
As far as killing I'm forever willing and ready
I will make my children's peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a machete
You marry the streets then we will kill at your wedding
Tell every guest at your reception they gon' get more than just hit with confetti
Now your bitch a believer
You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb?
You get the 'Ghini I'm sitting in
Riding through Pittsburgh while I'm listening to Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow, the blunted joint: here's the reefer
One minute you tough, one minute you shook
I know, I learned a while ago, to hide power from you, I should just put it in a book
You illiterate parasites: I kill you every time
Throw a nigga' body around the room, have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai
And yes I, am a firm believer that the naked truth
Looks a hundred times better than the best-dressed lie
And why you niggas is hating?
I wonder is God really an atheist? He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan
Y'all need to repent cause y'all been imitating
A statue of me, to you is a statute of limitations
You backwards as me and a feminist dating
Let's tally the sales like Gladys and Patti LaBelle: I'm a big wig
My straw's in the hole of a volcano: I'm having a big swig

Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary
Royce talking
D-12, worst fucking rap group ever (You ready?)

Somebody gon' die, it's probably YOU
You couldn't fit Bizarre's body in my shoes
Niggas quick to talk, all hood 'til I pop up
Plus, you just act tough cause Suge got locked up
I am above y'all, when you droppin your raps to diss me
I only recognize the top of your hats
And I don't like Proof punk-ass, he think he tough
He keep thirty niggas with him, cause he weak as fuck!
I ever catch you by yourself, I'mma fuck you up
Snatch your little cheap-ass chain and piece you up
You better hope you and the white boy keep in touch
And be a good little hype man, or your lease is up
Since Slim signed 50, I don't see your teeth as much
That's good, cause you got a grill like a fuckin truck!
DAMN HOMIE, it's history, over, hang it up
Go somewhere and hang up some 50 posters, PUNK
You speak too late, y'all prolly gon' go up to them awards
And get yo' ass whooped by B2K
I just wish Eminem would stop tellin' everybody he ain't speakin' to me
Like I'm one of his hoes or somethin'
How 'bout this, I ain't speakin to you, chump
And I'mma keep pickin on your weak ass crew
(You bitch!) Bizarre you a fat stutterin fuck
You a joke, I choke whoever buttered you up
I've been ridin by your house, you don't come out too much
You hidin, when I find you I'mma snatch you out of that truck
And tie your fat stankin ass to your couch and just
FEED YOU, you already look like you about to bust
Nigga you can run or hide; I'll be on your porch
With a cheeseburger tryin to lure you outside!
Cause he's in it, Bizarre say G-g-g-g-g-g-unit
I bet you throw some extra "g's" in it
Just like a stutterin' fool can't reach intelligence
He sweats when he raps, cuz he got a speach impediment
(You bitch!) Porky's pig and Porky's tomb
About to dig his own grave with a fork and spoon
(You bitch!) Denaun and Swifty please
Give it a year, both y'all be rakin' 50's leaves
What do I know, that other nigga y'all got in your group
I don't even know his name, but he can shovel my snow
(You bitch!) Let's face it I gave it to y'all
My lil' sister got six puppies that's braver than y'all (barking sounds)
Niggas is startin' the beef I'm 'bout to end with the quickness
I'm 'bout to end this quicker than Bizarre can finish a biscuit
Quicker than quick shit, y'all ain't felt the half
Quicker than Eminem can pinch Elton's ass
Don't call me, I ain't ready to squash it yet
Kiss my ass! I don't wanna talk to Hex!
I am so sick I should be compared to cancer
Y'all thought y'all dudes don't swing like Fred G. Sanford
I be makin' motherfuckers scratch their heads when I rhyme
Y'all lil' niggas crack ya heads then rhyme, go play;
You lil punk ass niggas, y'all can scream and yell all you want
I feel like I'm battlin' Keenan & Kel
(You bitch!) None o' y'all can put in the call to Kino
Paul better call me, like he called Benzino
Matter o' fact, I might even do a song with Ray
Sign with Murder Inc. and hit you with a song a day
We gon' beat yo' ass DOWN (4x)

I don't even want you lil' punks to think I'm mad
Y'all lil' niggas are Ninja Turtles, you're nothing
Nothin', you're not on my level, I will beat your boss's ass, nigga
Tre Little, bring it on

Tre Little, the baby gorrilla, I'm just that guy
I'm 5'6", got stacked lines, shit that high, I'm ridin'
FUCK you and your commercial appeal
I turn yo' head into blue 'n yellow +Purple Hills+
I bet you whatever that nobody beats my family
Eminem, Nelly said that he'll eat you like candy
What did you do, got on the phone and called him up
You don't wanna talk to Royce, but you talk to us
(You bitch!) Yo' crew some local hoes
I hit you harder than that white girl that broke your nose
You and Royce can squash this with one talk
Step around from your security and talk to that man
I understand you backin' yo' crew, but this my brother
Anythin' that happen to him, somethin' gonna happen to you
And I don't give a fuck for that, nigga, I'll do life
I advise you to stop; yo' money don't buy you stripes
Only thing that money brings is fake niggas and problems
Followed by niggas who hate fake niggas and rob 'em
But you niggas is WACK; Denaun I'mma stab you
So many times, I'mma feel bad when you collapse!
You niggas is so BITCH you make me sick to my stomach
Every beat that you ever made sound like it was missin' somethin'

You'll end up like click boom, bitch
Rock City motherfucker, regardless
Get the point bitch, or get the hollows motherfucker
It's Cash Flow, bitch, Big Homie
So low
Door is closed
Trust is broke
Words got choked
In my throat
Can't let go
Of my high hopes
My high hopes
My high hopes
(Say what?)

Papa came home from another day of hard
Work and handed me his key, told me "Go look in the car"
So I went out there to look for what he asked me to get
I was checkin' all the seats but the only thing I saw
Was a bag of cocaine (Say what?)
Uh, Papa was too silent, he ain't never tell a lie
I went in to tell him 'bout it, he said "Oh, that must be Guy
He worked with me at the job", I said "Oh" and walked away
He said "Oh, before you go, make sure you don't tell your ma'
'Bout the, cocaine" (Say what?)
Uh, me and little homie, we was walkin' to the store
It was right there on the corner and we seen a guy that's homeless
He was wrapped up in a blanket, he was lookin' really cold
Then he asked us for some change and he asked us if we know
Who had the, cocaine (Say what?) Cocaine
I'm losin' my mind, trying to figure out
How did I inherit so much pain
I drink a lot of alcohol, problems with the law
Would I have done better or the same
If Daddy never tried cocaine? Uh
Daddy never tried cocaine
Cocaine, uh (Say what?)

In my throat
So my father's only next logical step was to go to rehab
Can't let go
And that's exactly what he did
Of my high hopes
He went to rehab and got completely clean
Hasn't done a drug
My high hopes
In over 20 years
He did that for himself but
My high hopes
He did that because he didn't want to lose us
Whew, strong man

Uh, now let's talk about how much I respect my pop
He's been through so much in life, we ain't never had a lot
We just had each other's back, that was really all we need
Pop, I love you unconditional and thanks for loving me
More than, cocaine
My father chose me over cocaine
Cocaine, uh
I'm proud to say that I'm an addict who inherits your pain

Trust is broke
Words got choked
In my throat
Yeah, I'm starting to have fun now, so you know

I got the keys, keys, keys
I got the keys, keys, keys
Y'all are the kings, kings, kings
I roll up to squeeze
Y'all are the kings, kings, kings
Well, I'm about to see, I'm about to see
I talk scrilla like a art dealer
I'm large money that's been augmented for the small printer
Homocide business got me side flipping like I'm cartwheeling
I'm Godzilla wearing Margiela in the mall inside of the Guitar Center
Got the boss mental
Got me off a little barking at the dog kennel
Keys open doors, I said keys open doors, squeeze open fours
Leave your boys leaking, leave your overlord lookin' like some old weave on the floor
Please don't ignore me, I'm going to war
Blowing weed in a foreign toy
My shooters killing anything I'm pointing towards
Anything I'm pointing towards
I would swing this mic when I'm rhyming, thought I better bring it
I’m what you’d get if Fetty Wap were to rob a marksman
With Robert Markman, a dead eye Genius
A Jedi demon, he sip promethazine, I bet I lean him
I made a million, I ain't sell out, I just got the hell out Neiman's
Nigga, my chips up, ask me "am I in my P-R-I", I stop you just so I could spell out Pringles
I'm in the strip club, I shell out singles
I'm the flowing boss sweeping semis, pick one
Head or tails, either way, you are about to let Akeem in
I came in here to grow the crime rate
Bodies on top of bodies on me
I got skeletons in my closet that could do the "Famous" video with Kanye
My status loony, nigga, I love my chrome
IMac and Uzi more than Donald Glover love that song "Bad and Boujee"
"Bad and Boujee," I'm a black addict mooly
With an attitude in a padded room full of savage ghoulies
Eratic goonies
I don't battle, I look at battle dudes like "Battle? Who, me?"
Fuck you niggas, I'm steady waiting, I fed him bake
You know that devil's food, them Betty Cakes
And I got something for them crooked cops too, let him pray
Turn his wedding day Freddie Gray
Let that machete behead him, set him straight
Let it devastate, let his soul levitate, let the levies break
I'm murderous, I got Reaganomics in my verbiage
I'm a wavy rhymer, a Mercedes rider
I'm a 89'er Cartier with diamonds
At the furrier, Saint Laurent sipping Merlot
You would never catch me boxing with the burner
Hundred in your mouth like Ted DiBiase did to Virgil
Rolling over these hurdles playing C Murder then I'm playing G Herbo
Gang of cash on me, keep the thumper with me since I became a sinner
Black youngster, I don't know if I'mma tip the waitress tonight
Or make it rain for dinner
I don't know if I'mma sign a deal or stay independent, it's not just a simple thing
Aston Martin topless while I'm weighing my options on the triple beams
Learning that life ain't about the expensive shit, it's about the simple things
Like a sexy side bitch with zipper lip, clit nipple rings
You can not stop what is already going
African bitch got her face on my lap
The blacker she is, the badder she is
I was called tarbaby growing and I'm feeling up to par
Whenever I see the police
I address them as top of the morning 'cause I feel above the law
Riding, do I look like I am supplying the drugs? Fuck raw
I am the plug, fuck raw
You niggas is about as much action as a buttoned-up bra
I'm taking everybody instrumental, going Ted Bundy on it
Out here cooking so much the original sound like it's Peg Bundy on it
I'm Christmas gifting, y'all wrapping shit
I fit the description of accidents in the axel of the bent
I have an immaculate acumen
You a splitting image of accidental flatulence
All it takes to be a gang banger on wax these days
Is the engineer that come in and patch you in
Yes, sir, I'm too charming to stress ya
I'm cool, calm, and collective
I'm electric, you Carmen Electra
If I catch ya you gone on the stretcher
Now question
How much protection does a vest and armor get ya?
Especially when you armed with weapons stepping in the wrong direction of armageddon
Uh, keys, keys, y'all got the keys, keys
Ride up and squeeze, squeeze
Y'all are the kings, kings, heh, well, I'm about to see
Trust the fucking shooter

Uh
We in here counting dead president heads
Up in the years, it’s been up in the mills of dead president heads and counting
They put pictures of dead president heads on green, long papers
Then went and put dead president heads on mountains
How we ain’t gon’ make it?
You know what

I went from women asking “what’s the scent of your fragrance?” to center of attention
To dinners in Vegas, then all the way to Japan racking up yen
Now I’m all the way back
And I’m acting like Dennis in Vegas, stacking up wins
I’m a young black boy, armed, dangerous
To those who want to come and try harm or change him
While they’re living in anguish, while I’m living in real nigga harmony
Energy around me blend together like falsettos, tenors, and bass
All intelligence is on God level
All memories formed in melodies from the 70s
And all hail to all dinners and plates
And all hail to the cartels, and we out on a yacht
And you know how we know that we are and you not?
Because y’all are looking at our sales
I’m a motherfucking one-man army
I’m more R than our, I put the 'R' in ourselves
Uh, I’m the one they can’t generalize
Every time I come through straight, their wave minimize
Why? It’s probably ‘cause I gun through they gay enterprise
Niggas get crowned quick these days
Street this, best this, king that, we ain’t seen that
All we see around your clique is squad cars
Niggas need to get crown vicked these days
Stop kicking it, you couldn’t fit in my old socks
Let alone my shoes
I’m not a street nigga, I’m just a chip off the old block
I ain’t rocked with an entourage since ‘07
Niggas dissed Marshall after they copy his whole reference
Like we won’t send an actual firing squad to their studio
That will Basquiat their whole session
A lot of niggas dope, but none concern me though
I got that Pac, Big L, Pun eternity flow
I got that blowing that weed, taking that last drag in
And tossed in the infirmary glow
I’ll hit your broad in the gall bladder with this bald dagger
Have her hollering “not the knife” ‘til she having an orgasm
And all of her juices is haul-assing down the thighs
God dropped me off in the drop with the crossroads with crossed toes and dotted eyes
I’m not alive, I wasn’t born, I got a ride
Uh, get your popcorn, idolize ‘cause I’ve arrived
This is Cam Newton throwing bullets with the band shooting
This is beat submission from Bas Rutten
This the  it's proven
Nigga, pay your dues, you’re past due here
This cash rules, you’re looking at the wrong paper, this bad news
Relax junior, you still think you’re in high school
But you not, but you will be looking at your last new year
Ha, boo-ya, bombs over Baghdad
Compliments since 7 Mile, Fenkell Ave, Cash and Poo Bear
With directions to just go blasting through there
I ain’t stressing ‘bout none of you poindexter responses
I ain’t tongue wrestling with no artist unless it’s Ashanti
Nigga this, God, Gandhi, Kevlar labcoat
Mixed together with leather bathrobes like Plies and Fonzi
Cool science, I’m around lions and giants
You there, Ryan’s here
No one can hear you crying where I’m at, the highest tier
One diss track could tear your whole act up like the Flatbush Zombies
Gripping the Mac truck with Travis Scott, hitting your Macbook
I’m not a pioneer, I’m the last of a dying prayer
Living in forever, ever, ever, ever, ever in laughter
And ever since that heffer put me on MediaTakeOut
I ain’t fucked a basic bitch since
I got sophisticated bitches coming to my place asking “is it safe to sit?”
I said, “only if you have to take a shit”
Country chick named Delores, I let her sit on this Mason dick
Rappers blew up and get to shouting out designers
I like to thank my notebook, it got me out of the binders
Blacks never had each other’s backs
Rappers saying “All Lives Matter”? Okay, now we’re actually spineless
I’m into psychology nowadays, she say she bad
I’ll probably brainwash her like Hollywood did Stacey Dash
A lot of guys out slanging for a belt buckle like Pootie Tang
Wada-Tah!
5’9” the illest MC of all time right now and all the time
Kneel right in front of me like feel sobriety, young'n, or fall in line
Uh, right now, I’m piranha dipping in waters of Flint with the Slaughters and Em
Come on in, dummy, the water’s fine
Sniff around, I smell just like money, I ain’t hard to find
I’m doing big things
This bitch asked me do I got at least 50 shades
Just the other day
I said, “come here, let me kick game
I got more than 50 shades and just grey is the colorway”
I gave my momma a pic of myself in a big frame
And a card that says “bitch, I’m Rick James” for Mother’s Day
Uh, I just thank the Lord and pray for more
I just lifted the skirt of the devil
I don’t really care how you're dress her
Nigga, I'm just out here to take your drawers
Make the winner fall on the track
Let nature take it's course
I'm a product of the old Death Row camp
I ain't a fan of his, he might want to be standin' clear
I come with the cannon, not the cameras
I ain't Shannon Briggs, but let's go champ
Let's slow dance
Kill you with the first and give you seven more, necromance
Best flow versus yo petrol rants, you gassin'
This that new black Bent, blue Aston
This that who dat against who askin, who ya again
'99 the Outsidaz told me I wouldn't last
I'm too arrogant
But here I am, two boys two girls two era's in
And they over there on pills and heroin
Forks in they careers so that's real embarrassin'
If I could just get you clean through my charities
I might just let you breathe through me vicariously
But then again, I might not cuz I don't write sparingly
I'm torn between get along, fight, and why can't we
Fuck the Stitches approach
If I have to show up, I'm slashin' your throat
Your arms are too O.G. Maco to box with O.G. Wacko the G.O.A.T
I'm not a factor, I'm the whole problem
Down to subtract for a fraction of folks
Your favorite artist a diva
I put leaves around the heads of non-believers like drawings of Ceasar
Wake me when the sleepers are done ignoring me, bruh
I'll be flying with a full tank of gas on ether
If you from the block, watch y'all sons
Watch y'all daughters, cuz I saw murder
Slaughter much as I saw hot sauce and hot dog water
I came a long way from wishin' under the stars
But I ain't come all of this way just to say I've come this far
Coppin' paintbrushes with black cards
There's no limit when it comes to this art
No need for twitter followers, I dodged prison
I'm the non-equivocal black and at large
Listenin' to a Timbaland track in a villa in Calabasas
I'm that same little Cringer and Battle Cat kid
Addict specialty pen and pad scenematics spazzin'
Fuckin' wit' a bitch about as bad as my spendin' habits
I got nowhere askin' can I have it
All the valuables I have in this world, I had to take it
Had to open King Tut's tomb up in my imagination
Had to separate fear from respect then admiration
Get rid of your fears
Time to remove doubts and
Think about it, there's two sculptors named Gutzon and Lincoln
Who carved dead president heads
Who got paid dead president heads by the president
To move a mountain
Contemporary art deco
We keep the shit rockin' like the dails of Art Basel
Stompin' through this hip-hop shit like it's our step show
We survive
We should have bar mitzvahs for these bars
We the gods
We should shoot bar missiles with these bars
Beat the odds, look at the car see the rides
Don't be surprised, just realize
We ain't runnin' for president
So, we ain't worth shit
Unless we alive
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Mr. Porter don't trust you, I'm gon' bust you, nigga
That thang pop, pop pop
Whatever, whatever, whatever
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
Whatever, whatever

This that "your career's over" flow, for real
This ain't four-wheelin', roll with coke, heroin, 'caine
Bone chilling, cold with no feelings
Bangin dope-dealin-Hov and No-Ceilings Wayne
Started out like Nas, shoot gun
Heavy is the head with the crown
Slaughterhouse, my mind's two tons
Hardest out like John Q's son
And everything you say greasy
And made up like a piece of cheesesteak
And everything I say come natural
In this thing of beauty, like Alicia Keys face
How can I be hated in the streets
When I'm on even on my off day
I'm creative when it's beef, while you throw salt
I'm your baby mama and them new salt bae
I'll assault they a la carte tray
Molotov through your restaurant window
Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll, Nickel Nine, Ricky Grimes
I'm Sylvester Mindbender
I spark fours, that'll arch floors
That'll have whoever acting hardcore
Doing parkour, I'ma dog Porter
Brought the dog for, recording harsh thoughts for the art form
Taking me to your leader is like
Showing Chuck Norris where a glass door is
While I'm just tryna stay outta jail
Last war I stay strapped for it
Y'all can run while the gats blowing
And if I miss your ass, then I guess
You saved by the bell, like Zack Morris
I'm on bando time when I ride through cities
Before my time R.I.P. Bobby Krissy
Or Bobby, Whitney, flow K-Ci, JoJo
Let the Tech N9ne go KC, MO., bro
I don't stand my ground, I just demolish niggas
Simple you against me you ain't ridin' with me
Bitch not only do I kiss and tell
I'm Orlando Brown when I describe them titties
I'm the rubberband man, but I do more than count bands
Fuck sipping 40 ounces, I'm sober out here
Fucking hoes like 40-ounce Van
Nigga I'm Pusha T doing quiet numbers
Getting silent money, I'll retire from it
I don't dress loud, I throw the flyness on it
Let the labels talk and Desiigner mumble like Donald Trump
Throwing money hitting everybody and they auntie up
Trying to find someone to come perform for me 'fore I fuck the whole entire country up
I'm the first one gunnin', last one runnin'
Too enlightened for a check (yeah)
Any rapper that want it, I'm Wack 100
Invite 'em to a scrap (yeah)
I narrow down shit the Farrakhan way
You can find me anywhere the crime wave
I'm Schwarzenegger, you Sarah Conner
And your favorite rapper act like Eric Andre
Ryan's still alive, played nice 'cause the drama still flies
Even when you shoot your little Uzi vertical in broad day
Like you still tryna kill God
I'm French kissing with a "bitch you" mentality
Voodoo and como talle vous
While I'm hula hoopin' dollars for that snarly tooth
My future look like juju in a body suit
When you niggas gon' admit it?
That I'm better than the youngins
That I'm better than the legends
Never did I dumb it down or did I settle
I'm Rick the Ruler in every different measure
I ain't just the R, I'm every different letter
I can give your chick eleven inches if she let me get the leverage
I can be president of hip-hop which is let me switch endeavors
And I'm just having an open workout in Heaven
Tryna get me a good sweat
I'm Jae Millz looking up at the sky like, "Ayo B.I.G, am I good yet?"


When you a fiend for the rhythm and the beats just keep callin' ya
They keep callin' ya
They keep callin' ya

When it's hard to understand me 'cause my jaws keeps lockin'
My parents keep callin', the Lord keeps watchin'
I'm standing on the corner with my boys, beat boxin'
And anywhere I go, all of these whores be jockin'

The dogs keep barkin' at the top dog
They already lost it, nigga, it's a lost cause
I remember when I had to pawn all my jewelry
Was so embarrassed by the help that no one offered to me
Zoning off the bottle, we only taught to fight back
We only talk survival, walking home, we just might scrap
All we did was write raps, tryna get so drunk
Had to get my sight back, product of the old gun
Made some bad decisions so early on in the process
I had people out to get me, my album wasn't even out yet
I'm talking 'bout the self-proclaimed "King of Detroit"
I seen some people reaching they dreams, some people destroyed
I seen people die at the hands of the violence of man
Seen people shot out the sky, being fly as they can
Seen 'em split the pie up and Pam sniff her entire two grams
Slipping, now we in your crib to tie up your fam
'Cause it's hard to really focus when you're tryna stack for ya
Lawyers, with those in power tryna blackball ya
It's hard to find employers like accountants that's loyal
With those who told ya they adore tryna back-door ya
You ain't on-point though, one minute, you popping trunks
Next minute, you happy man, next minute, you sloppy drunk
Every January 1st, the ball keeps droppin'
And I'm just celebrating it at the mall, we shoppin'
Celebrating friendships, "Bro" this, "Cuz" that
"Fam" this, borrow that, loyal this, trust that
Comas after comas that were alcohol induced
If I ain't wake up from 'em, I won't ask what y'all would do

When it's hard to understand me 'cause my jaws keeps lockin'
My parents keep callin', the Lord keeps watchin'
I'm standing on the corner with my boys, beat boxin'
And anywhere I go, all of these whores be jockin'

I had to bite down, bite down
A nigga had to bite down, bite down
All I could do was bite down, bite down, down
Bite down, bite down, I had to

Hundred yard dash through the hood, talking money runs
Using that money counter, getting rid of them funny ones
You know the ones, too wrinkled to go in them slot machines
Throw 'em on the titty bar floor to lower a thot esteem
You could be the hottest thing and still have the wrong team
Sometimes to see the bigger picture, you need a wider screen
I got the arm out the black beatle, beating the drum
Mannequin challenging whole families, viva la drunk
It's Nickel Season, the fever's begun
I'm savage, even though my tat issa knife, I'm keeping a gun
Loaded cartridges, stolen cars with the Lowenharts
Rip the game apart and you are not worthy like Wayne & Garth
By now, my life's so righteous, I don't even sleep with groupies
I move like that nigga Spike Lee when he was Mookie
Back in high school, I really clowned
I said I'd do the right thing if Rosie let me ice cube them titties now
But this is realer than movie depictions
What you niggas know 'bout making a move in a beef and truly committin'?
It ain't no squashing it after you push a certain button
Make sure everything under your lip cut and your shirt is tucked in
Burning your beard away with Magic Shave
COs frisking your pregnant bitch, turning your kids away, thataway
That'll in a shallow grave, casualty of a cabaret
Daughter calling some wack nigga "daddy" at movie matinees
Even when we deal with Saturdays, my children still know that
I don't want another man's cheap-ass ways on my doormat
And anything I do from legal to illegal
I do this shit the ski mask way, like I'm Lil Kodak

When you a fiend for the rhythm and the beats just keep callin' ya
They keep callin' ya
They keep callin' ya
Yeah, we don't wanna do anything to scare your children
That's the last thing we wanna do
Dumb
Dumb!

I'm no longer a prospect
I'm what you call a veteran, a legend man, I'm a prophet (huh)
You ain't no artist, you're what I would call a concept
Made to inspire gossip like Shade Room or like Bossip
Welcome to the Grammy's where your likeness is used
For promos, hypeness and views, okay, I hope that you knowin'
That if you voted, you might as well've not voted for no one
They knew when they made that category where that trophy was goin’
All this industry shit is (dumb) there ain’t no middle class
Raise yo glass, here's to classism
Either you a rich ass nigga or you’s a bum, there ain’t no in between
Sinners sell they souls, angels sell they halos and they wings
I had dreams of fuckin’ a R&B chick
Then I found out that R&B chick already had a dick
Already slept with your favorite rapper, aren't we sick
You start as a artist and turn to alcoholicking quick
This shit is (dumb)
Man I wish I would let a nerd who work at Interscope
In a coat by Kenneth Cole, consult me about my image bro
I’m the best rapper out this bitch
Except the only catch is that I’m in this hoe

Oh (dumb)
They so dumb (so dumb)
And nothing that they do is new
They so dumb (so dumb, yeah yeah yeah)
Oh (dumb)
They so dumb (so dumb, so dumb)
They ain't foolin' me or you
They so dumb (they so dumb, so dumb)

Let's bring the punches back
You see them fake woke niggas that had to come to that, mm
I love promotin', elevation and a space that all my brothers at
And why I'm lyin'? I be turnt up to these mumble raps
Watch who you comin' at, don't be (dumb) uh
This where Confucius started thuggin' that, uh
This Metro Boomin' mixed with Thundercat, uh
That’s where my niggas gain they muscle at, uh
Somebody eatin' off your plate, how you gon' stomach that?
'Cause of that, all my niggas is (dumb) like how we get to this year?
Man I turn basic into intricate, I kill you with my simple shit
No tweetin' when we kickin' it, don't tell me what you finna get
Silly, you could drown without a membership
Watch who you swimmin' wit, it's ten of us ridin' up on the city bus
Sittin' here tryin' hit for the scripture like it's Leviticus
Tacklin' reality, prayin' that it don't injure us, uh
I love my niggas but it's really us
When we gon' notice that we so-?

Look at what you've done, messin' with my faith, yes
You think that I'm so dumb, no, I won't be the one (I won't)
Bullets from your tongue, shootin' 'round my way
Tryna kill me off for fun, no, I won't be the one
Look at what you've done, messin' with my faith, yes
You think that I'm so dumb, no, I won't be the one (I won't)
Bullets from your tongue, shootin' 'round my way
Tryna kill me off for fun, no, I won't be the one (dumb)
Nickel, tell 'em what it is
(This is a world premiere)

Look, I'm in a zone for reala
In a freezer with Medusa, I'm fucking a stone-cold killer
Your bitch vibing, I'm inside her and I tell your kids this:
Daddy's been doing more dick riding than Kari Wigton
I'm very venomous, you very innocent and
I will send a monster to your house, call him Harry Henderson
Oh my God, I was just in jail, then the
Devil caught pneumonia, and it made me sick as hell
You niggas counting me out can get the riches still
You're all in the Matrix, shoulda picked a different pill
You about to see how far that Paul Rosenberg will go
The height of my game is like DeMar DeRozan vertical
No one understands me, only one sicker than me is Em
I'm the new 'D' MC, it runs in the family

"Man why that nigga gotta bring Em name up all the time?
Man that nigga wouldn't even be rich without that nigga"
Shut up faggot!

I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(Too many sick niggas, Nickel bring the remedy)
(Make it real clear)
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real, kiss the ring, be gone!)

I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
My wedding with the streets got the cake with no vows
I'm arrogant as fuck, who cares? You suck
Rappers talking about "We the best" have been to Paris too much
Who hot? Who sick? Shit, I'm like a Theraflu slush
Y'all ain't fly, y'all fallin' slow with the parachute up-up
I'm a face-slapper, niggas sleeping on an outfit
Call us Taylor Gang 'cept we Wake and Bake rappers
Slaughter/Yelawolf responsible for haters' actions
Y'all on Gilligan's Island, find a greater Captain
Ha-ha, victory laugh
Even my photographer's happy, picture me mad
I feel well, your bitch sucked my dick, I nutted on the floor
Left her standing there crying over spilled milk

I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(Too many sick niggas, Nickel bring the remedy)
(Make it real clear)
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real, kiss the ring, be gone!)

My swing's like chains on a playground
I bust fly plus I'm about to put some wings on a Greyhound
My theory of you is: you lie and you drink beer
And I ain't hearing ya so you must be from Liberia
I wave bye like Hitler, 100-round Thumper
Bulletproof what? You gon' need an underground bunker
I aim where you should go
I put my whole life on the net, even my weapons
I am Bazooka Joe, ugh
We the shit, nigga eat a dick
We'll make him eat his words, we the stones, he the sticks
I'm going yelling Shady everywhere
Smacking niggas' bitches with they lipstick and they baby with they teddy bear
To you and your man: ain't gon' be no Talladega Night
I come to question y'all and y'all don't know what to do with your hands
Nickle Preme, killer team
At a different dealer every day like a fickle fiend

I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(Too many sick niggas, Nickel bring the remedy)
(Make it real clear)
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real, kiss the ring, be gone!)
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a goddamn minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait one fucking minute
I'm looking at your year end list
You're choosing rappers you're friends with
Who be rapping what their friends did
Toolie ratchets and extensions
Wait, wait, wait a minute
We done already heard their best shit
We already got the message
They on a lean, molly, Percocet trip
Think I found what real success is
Running around here since "The Message"
Forty pounder full of death wish
Money counter full of blessings
I sent a cannonball right at the cannon barrel
Through your wall, closet, through your damn apparel
Through your grandma chair, through your granite countertop
And I ain't tryna stop it 'til you standing on the doorstep
Of the man upstairs, nigga, you're next
Wait a minute, nigga
I've been going crazy on these records way before Flex
This the bad half Shady vortex, armed in navy warfare
Y'all them Barnum Bailey boys
Best to back the fuck up or get smacked the fuck up eighty million different ways
If I say it's fuck the world then the world's getting fucked
Eighty million different ways, when I'm finished with it
Then the world's gon get the AIDS like some 1984 sex
This the traumatize your favorite rapper year
This the homicide related racketeer
All I'm tryna hear today is trap and drill
It's all downhill from here like Jack and Jill, wait
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
I'm giving all my hoes an ultimatum, she my mascot
I'm just tryna motivate her, I'm just popping
She's just getting ass shot like a Soulja Boy home invader
I get a whole clip to all my haters
Just so I could go and get ex-o-nerated
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
I watch you niggas go tool up
I'm Compton menace on school bus
It's documented, boy, prove what?
Been dropping gems since I grew up
I got to fill this void move, bruh
The target's been destroyed, boo ya
These nerds rapping for attention
For a word from Vlad or Akademik
Prefer to slap you over engine
I'm Murs rapping for the Guinness
Wait, wait, wait a minute
I know you heard I'm back in business
I'm going harder than Tha Carter X
I'm birds flapping independent
I'm tycooning through the pressure
I'm typhooning through this weather
I might do a nigga beat for 'em
Give it back to him a little PHresher
Got the cash holding on line two, Brink's truck noise on one
Casanova with the rifle, fuckboy, don't run
I'm live from it with the streams
Buying guns and getting beams
You guys coming with your teams
It's feeling like iFunny with the memes
I flip the blade like "say something"
Around dough like Rajon
Let you rip the stage then I come and rip the stage
Down more like Trey Songz
Category slaughter gang shit
Feel me, nigga, this is God hustle
Phantom or the 'Vette
Tammy Lahren, Charlamagne shit, the odd couple
Wait, wait, wait a minute
I'm prime away from fucking mating with her
I bend her over, stick her on the expensive car
Tyler fucking Creator with it
You a lame, you from Twitter fame
You had a chain, that's your nigga chain
Face down on your computer key sleep
Closest you gon' be to laying in your name
Body bag after body bag
Leave a trail laying in your lane
I'm Cold Chillin' on the record business
But I ain't saying I distribute Kane
Wait a motherfucking minute
You popping molly with the actors
I fucked the baddest of the white bitches
I'm Talib Kweli with the blackness
I'm most def with immigration
Ladies on top of ladies
I'm Mos Def with immigration
Babies on top of babies
Wait a motherfucking minute
I have tried in vain, never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost, my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again, merry go around

My life's been going around 'n' round since '95
Went from going somewhere to about to die
Went from calling my chick a chicken
Cause she look like she got poultry around her thighs
To calling your piece a chicken cause she got no teeth
And she got crow feet, around her eyes
How hard are y'all? I got a heart the size of Arkansas
Count to five, these birds gon' hit the ground and they ain't from out the sky
Went from having an outta-this-world-flow, to doing a video doing the coon dance
To watching' my good friend Eminem winning' a moonman
I remember cause I was in New York with all of my boys to start shit
Letting 'em stay with me, long story short, they tore up my corporate apartment
Went from being a kid addicted to basketball
To being an ignorant nigga addicted to alcohol
Round and round we go is how this movie would end
Self-proclaimed King of my city, not really just truly the King of losing a friend
Who woulda thought this dude in the park who's true to his art would lose
Or win just by giving his thoughts and views

I have tried in vain, never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost, my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again, merry go around

You would hear that Ryan's skilled might even hear Ryan kills
You will never hear Ryan Stills, here to put the "i" in ill
My mind is still like a merry-go-round spill
Like leaving only guns to my kids when I'm killed, I got an iron will
Intellect of Zion, I done went too high on pills
To triumph, to hiding from bills, to buying buildings
Then I went from writing for Dre to wondering if my head was on straight
On the sidelines feeling forgot about listening to "Forgot About Dre"
From there I went to about a bottle a day
Telling who we know "Get outta my face!" okay I know what Kino said about Dre
I look at Kino to this day like that was a stupid mistake
But if it wasn't for him doing that, what would I be doing today?
If it wasn't for Cashis saying that he gonna beat my ass
Then me and Em probably wouldn't be laughing 'bout us getting past it
If it wasn't for me being outcasted I woulda never been on the underground rapping with SLAUGHTERHOUSE!

I have tried in vain, never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost, my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again, merry go around
Reflections of your strong friend
You need to check up on your strong friend
Nobody ever checks up on your strong friend
Uh, strong friend

I remember 2003, out hear screaming, "We next"
I was grippin' that 300, Rock & Rye Lexus GS
I put rhinestones in my durag, I put on leather pants
I went to parties just for Bacardi, I tricked, I never danced
All my friends expect to be treated just as my next of kin
Eyebrows lift up if I'm out with them and let them spend
The question is, "How is y'all problems becoming my problems?
I'm already hiding all of my problems behind my pop' problems"
When I was nine, seen my father beat the shit out of my momma
I'm smilin' right now, I'm trying not to cry about it
Alcoholic, I just spent five thousand tryna buy bottles of Patron again
Now sing along with your strongest friend

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

You need to check up on your strong friend
The one with strength that's never gon' end
The one with sense, take care of several grown men
Pay they rent and then they trade on him, the Devil play to win
I remember I had Maia Campbell in my Mercedes Benz
You probably thought she gave in to the plot of Satan's sin
She got demons greater than, you and I
And this message is to Denaun and to Shady, you say we friends?
Well take care of Lyric, 80 and baby Quinn like they Hailie then
Well shit, it's my funeral, y'all should play all of my songs too
Hope my body look beautiful, while I lay in my strong suit
Rumors spread about me that ain't true, that's how the fake do
If I'm the strong friend, then what the fuck do that make you?!

Check up on your strong friend, uh

Rest in peace my strong friends
Jahlil beats, holla at me!

Philadelphia meet Detroit
Time to shut your mouth (where your money at?)
Now it's time to show these motherfuckers what's the fuss about (time to go!)
What you dealing with lyrically?
A couple lyricists who don't miss
Niggas ask if Black and Nickle get together for an album, what you gon' get?
You gon' get rap on steroids, rap on steroids
Niggas that's silencers on the nozzle
You won't feel the clap, you'll only hear the noise
Ya'll got these hoes pegged so wrong while you hotel checkin'
I gotta pay these hoes just to keep their clothes on like I'm Odell Beckham
I'm flyer than a hat on Elroy
I just took it back to the Jetsons
I with the static like I got a Crooked I
Near an open exit with a bad connection
Cause no matter where you go
You're fucked if this rubber grip roll back in your direction
What you lookin' at? That's for your protection
This that rap on steroids, nigga, that rap on steroids
I just spit more clairvoyant raps
Than it take to make you half paranoid
Clap a gun at any day or night
Stand over his body then pray to Christ
Like "you gave me life so I'm gon' throw you back one, dear lord"
I'mma throw back one like Fab on the 'Gram
Garage look like it's sponsored by Hasbro
Got the whole ave going HAM
Y'all don't know with what y'all are dealing
I'm on every block, my team bigger
Cause I rap anything I wanna got
The only thing I don't got is feelings
Nigga my mind so clear
Feels like every thought is visine drippin'
No I'm not a lean drinker, but over that Fetty Wap I lean niggas
This that....

Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids

Y'all ran into me on the wrong day
Fuck strong Jay, do gon' say
Just bear arms, you in harms way
You hear alarms, you in Bombay
No Baghdad, get the gas mask
Run break, do a mad-dash to that gun safe
You un-safe in the right place to get blast at
And that's anybody
I stay on that anabolic
I'm far from anatomically correct
Ho's call me that anaconda
Roll a sack of that Santa Barbara
Lead poisonin' in the damn water
Flint, Detroit, Ann Arbor
Philadelphia and Harlem
Roid rage y'all damn problem
Cemetery too damn crowded
I'ma go get the jack hammer
Go bury a body, don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Everybody know everybody
I'm be damned if I didn't hear about it
Thought trifle the assault rifle
Got a twin brother like Irv Gotti, I'm 
Probably back on steroids
Kinda like crack on steroids
Lou Ferrigno super negro
Gon' and pack your steroids
Nigga my memoir's Renoirs
Everything I do is fine art
Putting rappers in that pine box
When that Black and Nickel Nine spark it's a problem
All stemming from them steroids probably
Got them coming back to Philly like it's heroin callin'
American horror, this that Smith and Wesson revolver
And if, life's a bitch we gon' Rohypnol her
They call it....

Rap on steroids

Nickle I'm rappin' on
Steroids, boy
Shady, I'm rappin' on
Steroids!
Right off the rip, nobody could fuck with me
I’m out of space, mind and body, my soul and so on
Mami I’m fly is an understatement, come to greatness

I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

Right off the rip, nobody is quite like me
You gon' need a NASA spacecraft to sight me
If you don’t like me, bite me
I could give a fuck, less fighting excites me
Leaning on the moon with a patron fifth
Playing my own shit, and I sound terrific
I’m not cocky, I’m beyond that
It’s time to start another hobby, I’m beyond rap
Run and tell your baby daddy and your son Ray
I’m hot, I sunbathe on the sun, bae
I’m the one on the one way
Hands and pretty long legs from the runway
My nigga Nauny is a genius
You gon' need a ladder just to climb on my penis
Got two words for the rap game, fuck y'all

I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

Right off the rip, you thought it was a wrap for me
Didn’t you? Go ahead and admit it hater
Cold as ice, I’m a living refrigerator
The reason hip hop’s breathing the defibrillator
I did a bid just for drunk driving
It’ll never happen again 'cause now I’m drunk flying
I’m an innovator, when I say I’m on Venus
I don’t mean that I’m dating the tennis player
I’m on Saturn where you don’t matter
Alone, I’m past the zone where your phone scatters
Hello? Can you hear me now?
You don’t got a fucking choice
I elbowed my way into everybody’s conversations
With rhyming, timing and patience, now I’m in space, bitch
I used to have to be on some "watch what I say" shit
But now you gotta take it

I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
I say a closed mouth don’t give head
On the flip side, know a closed fist don’t get bread
And if you swing it then you gon’ get lead
Boy I put ‘em in a panic, got ‘em all frantic
Overlook my antics, you’ll see that I’m a throwback
Hip hop Stan Smith, but it lessen my love
'Cause the so-called rulers ain't quite measuring up
Now let me give the chicks a message
Bitter exes'll tell you that the dick is precious
Three words, get over it
And if you speak mine, mention I could trip over it
Low key like my name too big for the bill
Betty White style, get it in, still
Plus I’m on the high you can’t fit in the pill
But I try anyway, we gon’ die anyway, ya heard

I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good
I got the summer on lock, and the winter too (winter too)
Let me show you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stuntin' but you broke, why you frontin'? (why you frontin'?)
We the topic of discussion
Got the summer on lock (on lock), and the winter too (winter too)
Let me show you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stuntin' but you broke, why you frontin'? (why you frontin'?)
We the topic of discussion, got the summer on lock

Nigga, I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm 'bout to start another life
You a target, I'll probably blast you twice
Alky rappin' with the passion of Christ
Curveball through the eye of the storm, I'm the calm 'fore disaster could strike
The rocks on that watch on that dial gon' shine loud
On you hustlers who out there in brownstones like the Huxtables
Y'all came to be euthanized, I can't be de-humanized
I ain't even human, I'm paying a communion wine
Cruisin' in that Wraith, dawg, like we came to offend haters
Shoot a nigga face off like his neighbor is Tim Taylor
Racketeerin' charge, tennis match in the yard
Y'all can finish that whack shit, then it's back to the gods
I'm in the Maybach right now tryna innovate
I'm too fly, don't try to give me my props, just give me space
Your favorite artist tryna party with Puff
I'm tryna fuck Cardi in a pair of Cartier buffs, what?

I got the summer on lock, and the winter too (winter too)
Let me show you you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stuntin' but you broke, why you frontin'? (why you frontin'?)
We the topic of discussion
Got the summer on lock (on lock), and the winter too (winter too)
Let me show you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stuntin' but you broke, why you frontin'? (why you frontin'?)
We the topic of discussion, got the summer on lock

HA-HAAAEEH!
Uh, it's fly season, my season
As long as I don't lose, it's all cool if I die even (cool)
Yeah, we the niggas that they talking 'bout (us)
Yeah, y'all the niggas that they chalkin' out
Yeah, I just let 'em go, I don't force 'em out
Supreme Court starin' at my man as they walk him out
The time that he lookin' at is crucial
I can see the pain translated through his pupils
Turn yourself in, it's even worse when they scoop you
See the Jake, don't hit the brake, just go to neutral
Barbeques, white yacht parties, that's what he used to
Pool halls, clubs and cribs, that's what he shoot through
Work out, get your number on, Akh (work out)
Say your prayers, get your slumber on, Akh (aha)
They ain't give you life so your number gon' pop
You best believe 'til the day you come home

I got the summer on lock (our-a sun shine all day long)
Tell 'em soul hustle all day long
Our-a sun shine all day long
All-all-all day long (ah, stop frontin', nigga, hah)
I got the summer on lock

Grind all winter, shine all summer
Life's a bitch and I'm tryna keep you slime balls from her
Any leaks, we gon' fix it, none of mine call plumbers
Nina to your chest player like nine y'all number
We Rondo niggas, real recognize real, you John Doe nigga
I made a closet out of a condo, nigga
See that's flyest nigga living shit, look over the river shit
She say I'm a asshole, how, when I don't give a shit?
It's play money, my son think the foreign a toy
That's why the family gon' ball like Lavar and his boys
I realize they wanna backstab me, then turn knife
You ain't got a hunnid 'till you got two hunnid, learn life
Respect ain't earned twice, once you lose it, it's gone
And it's lame when your money right but you using it wrong
Shout to niggas coming home this summer, the juice back
Screaming OJ shootin' craps, brought the tre deuce back, yeah

I got the summer on lock, and the winter too (winter too)
Let me show you you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stunting but you broke, why you fronting? (why you frontin'?)
We the topic of discussion
Got the summer on lock (our-a sun shine all day long)
Tell 'em soul hustle all day long
Our-a sun shine all day long
All-all-all day long
I got the summer on lock
Everything is hard, hard, hard
I mean life is hard, bills is hard
Shit, it’s all hard (hard, hard, hard)
Got to get that out your mind
I want to think that hard, be real with yourself. College ain’t for you
In fact, I want you to take up a trade
You know, become a carpenter
Did you know Jesus was a carpenter?
She don’t want you. Getting in that girl’s drawers is hard
Remember that, boy, hard
Good luck, baby

Teacher, Teacher I don’t understand what you even wanna talk for
Unless an interpreter’s gon' come up there and talk for me
Because we don’t speak the same language, you say shit like “take up a trade and your thoughts bore me”
You don’t teach me nothing, you just talk towards me
I’m gon' need your assessment and fast
Look around you, do I look anything like the rest of your class?
Can’t you see that I’m special?
I don’t act like these fucking crumb snatchers
I don’t even breathe like ‘em
I was born with my lungs collapsing
I walked right up to the drug dealer in my class and asked him
“How did you get such a bad bitch?”
He said “it was hard and the best ones are the hardest to get”
And I went on to see the world, and he went on and started the trick
And now when I see his girl, she be on my dick

I guess fucking the baddest bitches around wasn’t hard as I thought
Man, what the fuck was I thinking? (Get Money)
Jewelry and cars (cars, cars, cars)
Achieving the highest level of success ain’t as hard as I thought (top the world)
What the fuck was I thinking? (I was drunk)
I was drunk or I was lost (You was lost) (Yeah)
My people said it would be hard (Hard, Hard)
My teacher said it would be hard (Hard, Hard) (It’s gon’ be hard)
What the fuck was she thinking?
Why did I listen to y'all?
What the fuck was I thinking?

My finest hour is here, this is what I see in my prayers
This is me, though I’m facing all of my fears
Making all my enemies look in the mirror
And see the meme of the Jordan face with all of the tears
What most of you analysts ignore, it’s my explosive animal allure
I went away to get in the way of my wife planning a divorce
Handled it and came back more talented than all these rappers
Though I’m DiCaprio, all they have on me is the awards
I’m a Steinway grand piano, they’re Casios, I will kindly pass them the torch
The day that one of them are able to hold a candle to my corpse
I’ll put a hand on your whore, even if she ain’t my type
And this song is inspired by Broadway play called Hamilton I saw that changed my life
Right away, so my next move is to either screenwrite a movie or write a play

I said fucking the baddest bitches around wasn’t hard as I thought
Man, what the fuck was I thinking? (Get Money)
Jewelry and cars (cars, cars, cars)
Achieving the highest level of success ain’t as hard as I thought (top the world)
What the fuck was I thinking? (I was drunk)
I was drunk or I was lost (You was lost) (Yeah)
My people said it would be hard (Hard, Hard)
My teacher said it would be hard (Hard, Hard) (It’s gon’ be hard)
What the fuck was she thinking?
Why did I listen to y'all?

I’m looking like the black Bond in Africa
Hotel room look like a beautiful crime scene, in fact it’s a
Spectacular Halle Berry, Vivica massacre
Left behind by a serial bachelor
Fall back, y’all, I really don’t fall back enough
You’re not gon’ not sound soft to us
The shotgun will throw a box of black balls at ya like Count Chocula
That last line, I was just on my Pharoahe Monch
Rappers, kneel before me like I’m trying to prepare a punt
I’ll cut your body up and put it in two different cars
Put it in the river, have you swimming in a pair of trunks
Momma asking when I’m coming to the church
My little brother asking for the Aston
I threw the keys to him like I’m fronting up some work (Ha, good looking, Nickle)
I used to not be a trendy guy
Now I probably got more pairs of Balmain jeans than Wale and Envy got
Ah, somebody pinch me
Pardon me

Teacher, teacher, I’m so sorry I’m late
I’m Lyric Montgomery’s father, I’m here for Career Day
(Hi, Mr. Montgomery)
Can I talk to the kids?
Hello, children, how was your day?
I’m Royce Da 5’9”, and over the years
I’ve been blackballed
I’ve been in jail
I’ve seen lives turned
But guess what I’ve learned?

I learned that fucking the baddest bitches around wasn’t hard as I thought
Man, what the fuck was I thinking? (Get Money)
Jewelry and cars (cars, cars, cars)
Achieving the highest level of success ain’t as hard as I thought (top the world)
What the fuck was I thinking? (I was drunk)
I was drunk and I was lost

And you know what else
Everybody asking me just because I'm a lyricist in this business
How come I haven't gone broke yet?
I tell 'em it's cause I'm the flyest backpacker ever
I'm flyer than Mos Def in a Trump tower surrounded by four chefs
Fixing him some salmon croquettes with Kendrick, Cole and Kweli
In their Jidenna clothes, try me, you and your crew will bleed
Y'all bums ain't shot for the stars since New Years Eve
Nothing was given to me
I had to go upside heads just to get upside hills
Never over the hill though, so I don't strike when the iron is hot
I strike whenever the fuck I feel
I eat what the fuck I kill
I got this way from not being allowed to eat dinner
If you knew how much I've lost, you'd have no problem with me winning
How many times could I be reinvented?
Money is the deadlier of the five venoms, in my denim
Definitively got a wad in 'em, garages with cars in 'em
Hanging out in bars to have menages with bartenders
God was an artist and Jesus was a carpenter
They put me together like an easel in the darkness of hell
And lost it and left me some loose screws, but
These are the nails to your coffin
These are the folk tales of a starving artist
Battling demons through his notepad like Adam and Eve eating kale in the garden
Flying private away from all charges
You want what for Christmas?! Hell no
What you mean 'this is all we got'?
That's it

It's Christmas time in the Montgomery home
Daddy's actin' all crazy again
Momma got herself a bloody nose
Daddy slapped her in the face again
Why they always gotta fight so much? Damn, Momma face swole
Me and my bros in a panic state
If that's the case yo, I can't just stay around this
Everything was fine, we just had dinner, we got all the He-Mans
Battle Cat, Adam and Cringer, even Castle Greyskull and Snake Mountain
Now we sit and listen to y'all argue about how y'all planned this day
And y'all just admitted to us Santa fake so Kid Vishis just ran away poutin'
Now I gotta go and console him, he wasn't nothin' but a spoiled little boy then
Little naive with an innocent cry, all he ever wanted to do was fit in with us
And y'all bought him a pair of fake Timberlands and put 'em in a real Timberland box
I never forget them boots, they was called Rugged Outbacks
Momma went and found them at Payless and made us promise not to say nothin'
Then Pop came in like he ain't know nothin' about it
Like, "Judy you gon' send that boy out in public like that?"
"He'll be just fine, these kids ain't 'bout to be
Looking down at his feet for no tree", and she really meant that
Meanwhile, this little arrogant nigga called himself stuntin' on me and Greg with him
Talkin' about, "Where your Timbs at?"
But he was too young to detect sarcasm so we was like, "Nigga, where yo' Timbs at?"

It's Thanksgiving in the Montgomery home
Greg just came in here drunk again
Now momma tryna cover for him
She afraid my daddy gon' punch him again
Why you gotta get drunk so much? Damn!
I wish you would just stay where you was at
Instead of coming home all rude and disrespectin' all our father's rules and shit, man
The mood done switched me and Vishis playing Connect Four
Our favorite movie just came on the tube and it's ironic it's "Bloodsport"
And I'm looking at Frank Dux and shit, thinkin' you should split
Before Daddy come down these stairs of this basement and see you wasted
But he just cut me off like, "That nigga ain't gon' do shit"
But the truth is this, he couldn't whoop my dad even if he was sober
I know cause he tried once
Ended up unconscious, a broke arm and a tooth was chipped
My big bro got a lot of emotional problems, he feel that we was all abused as kids
He saw momma get dragged down all kinds of stairs like a ragdoll when he was two
And this is back when Daddy used to sniff cocaine, poor thang
He had to be subjected to this when he gets drunk, he gets to losing it
He gets the illusion that he gon' protect us all from the Big Bad Wolf
Stand up to him and prove some shit
But all he really doing is stressing mom out
Got her goin', "Boy, you know your daddy up there asleep
The food is ready, why don't you stop
Making all this noise and let him stay 'sleep?"

The turkey's done in the Montgomery home
Dad has just been awakened again (uh-oh)
Greg is making all kinds of noise
Daddy's on his way angry again
"Who is that making all that God damn noise?" (not me)
"Greggy, get up here! You been out there drinking again?
What the fuck I tell you about coming in my house with this disrespectful shit?
Nigga where the fuck you done been?"
I'm thinking to myself "Greg please don't say nothin' stupid, man"
Every time my daddy in his drawers and he standing in the hallway
Mad at somebody, I swear to God he got the same strength as Superman
My brother turned around and just walks in the kitchen
Without even givin' an answer with his back to him like, "I ain't gotta talk to you nigga"
"Nigga, you don't hear me talking to you?"
Next thing my brother did is something that when it comes to my father is something you just don't do
He looked him right in his eyes and he asked him
"What the fuck is you gon' do?" (Mm, mm, mm)
My father hit him so hard his body hit the stove
The oven door hit the fucking floor
The turkey fell out the oven whole and landed near the stairs
Now Daddy standing over Greg
Talkin' 'bout, "Nigga, you ain't hurt! Get up, get up!"
And here come Vish' talkin' 'bout, "Dad, I don't think he gon' get up"
Then momma went damn near hysterical
She called the police, the police came
Neighbors is all in the street
Watching the cops takin' my father out in handcuffs
Damn, man that shit was real embarassing
To all my friends I grew up with, who grew up fatherless
I know through me you live vicariously
I want you to know that we ain't know better than you and yours
We all needed therapy
We care about each other more
Than we care about if anybody understands us
What I'm tryin' say is "Fuck you!"
And Happy Holidays from the Montgomery family

Every man reaches that point in life
Where he don't want to make excuses no more more
Life took me on a rollercoaster ride
I've been up, I've been down, all the ribbons and my daddy game
Took me on highs
Turned around and then took me on lows (that's how the story goes)
Ohh, then I think about it
I use that shit as fuel
Then I changed it into power, now can't you feel it?
Can't you feel it?
That I'm a grown man with power, yeah, let me hear you say "yeah"
If you was raised in a strict home like me, felt alone like me
And it gave you power, ooohh
You can do it too, just look at me
See I'm a grown man with power, yeah, everybody say "yeah"
If you don't know the meaning of abusive
You've been through so much ain't nothing nobody can do to you
Now can't you feel it? I'm a runaway
This is how I became, a grown man with power
Ooohh, you can do it too, if I can do it
Use this power, I was a runaway, I was a runaway
There ain't nothing none of you can do to me, do to me

When you were a child growing up with Grandad and Granny
Did you really feel like Grandad was a good father to you?
Absolutely, absolutely
All my friend's daddies was walking out on them left and right
Y'know he never left us, he was always there for us
Y'know there were a lot of things that happened that I didn't understand
Maybe I might not have answered the question the same way when I was a teenager
But I understand and appreciate him so much more now as a man
Y'know 'cause he taught me respect and discipline
And consequences for your acts, so yeah, of course
Do you think his approach as a father
Really shaped the type of father that you are today
Or do you in some ways think it had negatives to it
And if so, what kind of negative traits
Do you try to avoid having as a father right now, to me?
(When you have your own, you'll understand)
The separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel, who have dreams, that want to do things. Talent you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft


I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Nigga, I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Killing microphones, killing microphones

I been like the zone
When you talk to me minimize your tone
Take some of that bass out your voice
Don't go and put your Energizer on
With this beat I'm going all the way
I don't mean to the end of night, come on
I mean I'mma take it to the grave, untilI end your life it's on
I'm talking about cracker-jacking these niggas
'Til their whole enterprise is gone
I'm talking about clapping at these niggas
With some shit that's gonna feminize you strong
I'm talking about tenderize the bone
I ain't talking about weird science though
When I say that my ceiling is probably gone
I'm talking about villainizing your home
Nigga, I been in like the zone
I'm looking like Rambo in this bitch
But nigga, I ain't feeling like Stallone
Feel more like I'm in a heist alone
Look, I don't like to aim my shit at any artist
When I'm writing I'm just generalizing
How am I gon' take a shot at something
I can't even fucking identify with?
I'm feeling like the long days away from feeling my Patrón
Used to have the coldest bitches waiting for me
Chilling by the phone
Used to do donuts on the grass
Now I'm just feeling like a drone
'Cause even though I'm sitting high somewhere
I'm still spinning by your home, bitch


I've been killing microphones, bitch, killing microphones, bitch
I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Nigga, I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Killing microphones, killing microphones

This a new life, who this? This a new phone, who this?
I'm in a new zone, who this? This ain't no Redbone and who this
I'm sorry, my top is unavailable right now
My roof gone, who this?
Nigga, my taste amazin, my chick look like the waitress from Hooters
And she about to fix me dinner
She independent, but she into niggas that's big spenders
And I'm into fitting this dick in her
And she into fitness like Brittany Renner
I used to chase the liquor with the Guinness
Move-making, nigga, with the business
With the winners in the bed with two majors
I still wake up feeling independent
I'm a savage, on top of that I'm a reckless product of D&D
Stop critiquing me, my detractors
Just couldn't sell a record to the DMV
I'm somebody, ain't nobody better than
My precise knowledge and intelligence
Well advanced, I swipe a knife across your white collar like a cheddar scam
I put your lights out like Edison
Ain't nobody out there ready for him
My blood type B positive, your type O like the credits wrong
I'm immune to all medic-on, blue Ferrari head is gone
Went from palladiums to colosseum stadiums
You perform in the Reddit forum
I spot a bitch nigga like Cyclops on Santa Monica
Got a model blowing my mind
My new Monica is blowing my harmonica
The car odometer is on the bottom
Of all the numbers like you dial star pound
Or put the car around white walls
Call 'em fire marshalls to come and shut the party down
I'm the leader of CMB, doing 52 over speed bumps
In front of your table with TMZ doin interviews while you eat lunch
I deal with mics real Kendrick-like, I'll kill a mic
Cash rules everything around me until I die
Looking right into the vanilla sky
I'm funny acting "who this?"
You owe me money, run me that or do this
Get a running start, jump into a hole, take a hole in that beluga
I act like them older cats with moola
Dragging motorcycles past the light
With Kodiak on that Patrón, I'm hot and on cognac, I'm cooler
And I'mma show no reaction to your rollie flashing like my zodiac a jeweler
Ain't nothing but a dead something, I be headhunting, yeah, I'm going for that medulla
Boo-yah, don't be acting foolish
Baby, this a new phone, you yapping "who this?"
Maybe everything I'm gon' say from here on then is gon' be on the behalf of "who this?"
(Hello) This a new life, who this?
I'm on a roll like two dice moving
I'm on a boat in Dubai fooling
On the moped flute-by shooting
I'm an unapologetic work in progress
Product of a hard-working dedicated father with shortcomings
Praying all his sons make it farther
People say that it make you softer to raise a daughter, but it made me harder
Smarter with the way I make dollars just to make sure she stay a baby baller
The way I zone is like the AC on
I play like KC and KG, you can't even cage me
I be using Windows like I'm on a HP
Just look around, I don't own a thing that ain't in HD
I ain't interested in the crown that don't belong to Wayne, Shady or Jay Z
That's a opposite
You don't like your life, how about death?
You don't like to fight, how about sex?
You don't like the kind of car you drive, okay, how about Bow Wow's jet?
I got the kind of flow that destroy the place though
How about you take your shot at Rihanna like I did when I said "hi"?
Or how about with Soulja Draco?
How about I come through and paint the floor with your whole crew?
How about the coroner come through and tell you go get Maaco
How about I don't give a fuck about burning bridges?
How about I walk through the fire 'cause I'm hot and I got the golden gate flow?
How about I box?
How about like Argyle
I sock niggas and give 'em disease like a irock
How about I hop out the Maybach and challenge every living emcee?
Shoot 
Trust the fuckin' shooter

Being feared goes farther than any part of me having respect does
So I play to the tune of my own eardrum
While I'm out on my quest, love
I don't speak on behalf of myself, but my impeccable rep does
Christmas morning I remember waking up wishin' I could just go to sleep
Cause we only got like two toys a piece
I ask my pops did he do more for me?
He said "yes, I got you clothes and heat
And let you keep a whole two rows of teeth"
Ha, I'm royalty
I took whoopings, I took losses, but no defeats
Been dropped, and been shelved with no release
Been in jail, no commissary or relief
But God looks over me like a cross and rosary
Rifle in hand, I let niggas have it, I won't hesitate
Writes on the cans in the cabinet "section eight"
My son got on them three-fifty boots Kanye West is dressed in bape
Askin' me questions 'bout gettin' to second base
Uhh, wifey textin' SMH, house phone ringin' off the hook
Conference calls from record labels, guess I'm late
But, my other son's autistic, he wants my attention
This might just be my defining moment, let them wait

It's my time now, nigga; let them wait
Pick up the phone, tell 'em hold; let them wait
Old friends comin' to they senses tryna' reconcile
After I fell out with them, well fuck them niggas; let them wait

Wait, I'm here for that green, for that mula
You scheme, I see right through ya
I'm regal like a Akeem, father King of Zamunda
One thing's for sure I think they do know
That me, and Porter, and Jake Uno
We don't play no games, no, we play sumo
We attempt to flatten into action
With all these average, flacid defenseless rappers
I have no problem killing like sent assassins
They temper's bad when my temper's graphic
They hide or they fly while I'm high and flyer
I'm intergalactic, I've been spectacular
Flippin' like I invented spatulas, my lyrics is futuristic
I'm in here with my vintage ratchet with prints and scratches
My mental action-ly incapacitates fast as my passion
And pen surpasses my Aston
And leave a skid road in the street like I'm into smackin'
I fill my engine with acid
With my finger wrapped around a hair-trigger that resembles lashes
I get into bitches quick and then I get distracted
I'm like the stock market, just like that, my interest crashes
Like a cymbal, my symbol should be expensive glasses
She with me, she a afro-centric nympho chick with a ass did
She callin' me back-to-back for a second date
While my ex is callin' for make-up-dick -- let them wait
Money all over the ground like Scotty from New Jack City, I weapon wave
Everybody, step away
They said that we should go our separate ways, in high school Now they wanna jump the line in my shows -- let them wait
My whole life, they pressured me -- let them wait
You rushin' me you rushin' excellence -- let them wait
Police in my rear-view mirror with they sirens on
But I'ma call my lawyer first 'fore I pull over -- let them wait

It's my time now, nigga, let them wait
Pick up the phone, tell them hold, let them wait
Old friends comin' to they senses tryna' reconcile
After I fell out with them, well fuck them niggas; let them wait
Yeah
Yeah
808 Mafia

I've been had the moves (been had the moves)
I got the moves since I got my studio (I got my studio)
I got confused (Hella confused)
I can't figure out for the life of me how I can lose
(how can I lose?)
How I can lose? (how can I lose?)
But I've been had moves (I got the moves)

I got I Decided on pre order, my lil homie just went gold
I hock a loogie on a reporter, Detroit is on Pete Rose
That's Armstrong on steroids, gated up no wing toes
My phones blowing up so much a nigga may end up like Cee-Lo
I bounce back like the fattest ass you can have attached to the fattest hips and anything after this shall be considered cataclysmic
Countin' packs like a statisician
Emphatic charisma
Savage enigma
I have a religion to handle your rhythm like cannibalism
The camera rollin' and it's time to flow
I don't know
I just go carnival
I'm from Motown you know
I can just line up the hollow tips inside the clip
And I can just go down the road
And knock 'em down like some dominoes
After you already out then I'm dropping some more like you 2Pac and the commandos
Watching my comments like papparazi watching Sasha Obama grow
I got Elijah Mohammed glow
I got the dough these rappers claim they got at the house in my drawer in the envelope
My focus phenomenal
My temperature so hot and cold I broke the thermometer
Guarantee I will kill the flow
This remind me of LaLa Anthony ass in that New Edition movie
Niggas tryin' to cover it up and make her look old
Guarantee I'mma still steal the show
I been had the moves
I remember these bitches was just a dream
Actresses and models I used to only see on television
Now they be climbin' out of my television lookin' at me to get the ring
I remember all I used to be around is dudes that used to try to just kill by me
Choppin' and conceal bodies
Used to clean up the bloody mess up in front of me
I had to holla at a tube
I had to still deal with that field sobriety
Had to do a double take at the dirty mop when he was finished
Looked like Lil Yachty
Nigga, I went to jail for the whole year
I got out and I did the same thing you wack ass rappers do when y'all got your little show here
I came right out to booze/boo's
Straight right out the news
Right off the cover of a magazine
Had the magazine with me at the club showing people like "Look at this and please try not to drool"
I fuck a Stacy thick ass for all the days she used to make me work
And Tracy slick ass but not before I fuck April first
Translation I'm bout to fool
Y'all countin' me out well I got you
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, here I count for you
Biiitch

Last time took an 'L', now it's time to bounce back
(I been had the moves)
I was broke as hell, now it's time to bounce back
(I got the moves)
Every time I fail I got up and bounced back
(I been had the moves)
And nothing y'all can tell me about that bounce back


I’m doing this cause this what God want me to do
These lyrics is ordained by the Lord
You gon' get these bars
For free

It’s bad half and finally famous
The weapon’s Iranian
Y’all niggas is Pomeranian
My damie y’all Pootie Tang
Nigga I’m Damien
Shots drop from out of my cranium
My mind is Lebron drainin’ em
Five finger ring titanium
Already in your top 5
Now my dingaling now dangling
I’m flyer than Tom Chambers on the first NBA Live
Double pumping from the three point NBA line
On that war page with that 24 gauge
But when I double pump it I’m prime Chamberlain
Every track on the record got a background message
“We don’t back down ever!”
I’m putting the autobiographical book out with the Book of Ryan
I just let my bitch in LA read, now that sounds epic
My mind carries words
You couldn’t walk a mile in my patent leather Larry Bird black con weapons
I hope you know theres more fish that’s in the sea
I stole ya ho, we been kissing like we been sitting in a tree
And these ho’s in Detroit be trickin’ sooo much
They can completely gooo up a magician’s sleeve
You’re totally awesome
While I pour 40’s on corners for those we lost
My soul suffers from holy exhaustion
Trippin’ on opium just to cope with openin’ coffins
The devil sittin’ close enough to me to quote me an offer
Keep the union in unison like the Soviet’s marching
We goin’ iron for iron like a trophy in golfing
My nigga, better yet, I feel like the only man who can understand me is Sloth from The Goonies
Cause he retarded as fuck, on a boat with a treasure chest
That makes perfectly good sense
That’s exactly how my career went
Like a fuckin’ experiment
I got a lot on my mind that I gotta deal with
First of all, my favorite uncle died and favorite auntie died
I missed both of they funerals fuckin’ around with rappers
So every day and every night my conscience cries
I’m stressed out because my moms be tired, pops be workin’
And Lord knows I done threw enough dollars on the floor in the past for moms to retire
That’s why I be in the lab and my mind be wired
Trying to figure it out fast before my time expires
Man, but it’s this one thing that always on my fucking mind and it haunts me constantly guys
And that’s why in the fuck have I not at least tried to get in between Ashanti’s thighs
I’m feeling like a straight sucker I faced the vibration
My sober, righteous life only got a place for my lady
But maybe I can ask my lady for permission
She can give me a hall pass like Jason Sudeikis
This audio porn I’m giving with a bit of sense
A mind fuck if you will
I’m from Detroit but if I send you to the store with a large bill for some little shit
Bitch, I was born by a river in a little tent
Now I just ride with six vehicles with an ill tint
I’m cut from the kind of cloth that’ll never go outta style
With or without the internet my shit’ll still trend
That’s why I’m still standing with everything I came with
Cool as a Jacuzzi everything in me is built in
Nah, I don’t borrow I’d rather discuss loaning
I’m ready to go to war with whoever the fuck want it
Y’all weigh your respect against your release date
I’m just an artist dog I don’t know how to be fake
I don’t want no problems dog
I don’t wanna be apart of nothing with lies involved
I don’t want no phone that receives a thousand calls
I don’t need to be around a thousand smiling broads
With they hands out
Probably couldn’t survive without em all
But they can’t vouch for who the next sucker
(Ryan) Never would have made it
Now I'm glad I make it out
It's God speed
It's God, yeah
It's God speed
It's God, ahhhh

Uh, this is just how I zone when Porter spaz
I was born at a quarter past
I was the color purple, Mom and Pop took me home in a Crown Royale bag
Now I'm the hottest nigga that you know with the coldest intentions
Uh, all I know is this flow and this pencil
The Lord is my shepherd, the Devil's my Doberman Pinscher
The industry said I had to be an alcoholic
Who be havin' threesomes, be doin' acid and havin' seizures
Wish I could go back to my old school and slap the teachers
All I had to do to blow up was an album packed with features?
I don't relate to common folk, they focus on the comments so
I'ma go roll a Testarossa down the coast of Monaco
Lo and behold, your honorable
Niggas is sheep, niggas is sleep, 'bout as woke as a dinosaur
My connect'll give you a whole kilo of coke so he can go Geronimo
He should receive a trophy for bein' the holy Jesus of flows
He the G.O.A.T., baaah
That should be my, taaaag
I'm from the streets where the odds are not even
Robbery, thievin', ballers, debauchery, schemin'
Allah and Jesus, it's hard to believe I'm a product of Eve
In the garden of Eden, speakin', how targeted we been?
Rihanna stalker, I'm parked in her DMs
Shark in the deep end, put the paws on you, I soften your defense
Hit your pause button, halt your critiquin'
Talk is cheap, the more you niggas talk it, it cheapens
And all I see is prayer 'round the streets today
I'm about a freak away from havin' Issa Rae eatin' out LisaRaye
Any artist out that you see is great, tell 'em I said bring his ass
Better bring his A, let his single play
We don't care what you sing, hit you in the face with the butt of the gun
You leak and get your street cred and a few streams
Pop go the weasel, nigga
Fiva Nina, I'm the illest, you got pop culture fever, nigga
All I know is Big and Pac quotes, pop toast and squeezin' triggers, speedin' tickets
Now I'm pullin' cops over, give them niggas season tickets
Teesha used to shoot me down vicious, now she the missus
She turned me to a family guy quicker than Peter Griffin
I told myself when I was 14 that she the one
Now a nigga probably got more seeds than Peter Gunz
Now I go out to get my groceries in two-seaters
Used to roll the old school, four speakers and two tweeters
Ridin' with nothing but raw quarterpacks and duffels
Ryan writes heaters
Y'all niggas is cut like one them "Get Rich or Die Tryin'" wife-beaters
Me? I'm just all shoulder straps and muscle
If you a hater, let's do it, I whip you now then whip on your boy later
Them whippins'll go around like a tornado
I get rid of more yayo
I don't do Rodeo or ales, I do the Floyd May-o's
So many men shopping the women's section, it ain't no ladies left
These niggas crazy? Yes
They playin' crazy like the Chappelle sketch, Wayne Brady ep
I'm what you get when Freeway Rick and Cocaine 80's met
Bringin' bars back to the streets like Jay and Nas beef
Broadcastin' "Ether" in HD at God speed
Security, yeah, yeah
Security

Let me tell y’all a story about somebody I feel was a gangsta
And that’s the very same reason he ain’t here with me no more

He marched around the corner like a soldier
But not to get no on-the-mic exposure
To question me, I guess he checking me
I’m feeling like I’m looking at my own self in the face
As deaths destiny awaits us both wearing vests’s
Us both stressed from the same pressures
Us both fucking train-wreck reckless
Guns whip out, he had a .9, I had a .40
I remember a point in time where he had mine
I had his shorty and I could cry telling this story
If you can visualize a downtown crowded street, somebody was eating
And saw P pull out his piece and decided to reach (Security)

Police rolled up on like "Police freeze!!" (Security)
Cuffed us up like nothing (Security, yeah, yeah)
Asked us what we got guns for, we told ‘em it’s for (Security)
(Proof, this one’s for you, I love you Doody)


He marched up out his house like a soldier
Decided to titty-bar it
A lot of alcohol consumption and drug use
While out with the city’s hardest, niggas
Throwing money up with black face, flicking photos
The only thing he was missing was my nigga Dolo
He decided to leave them and go to an after-hour
After the 4-hour, he act crazier than Scarface after snorting powder
He get into it with this dude, point his piece at him
They say he shot him, problem is, I don’t believe that
And on the real I, only know shots flew
And when the smoke cleared they say he got killed by (Security)

Shot my nigga like that, that (Security)
Probably shoulda watched his back (Security, yeah, yeah)
It’s fucked up, right? (Security)
(Proof, this one’s for you, I love you Dudey)


I know y’all seen Beef III
And it probably made you think that I ain’t like Shady
The truth is, I was at Proof's funeral
Crying like a baby, I was sitting in the back row
With Vishis, wishing I can go up to Marshall
Denaun, Swifty, Obie, Bizarre, Paul and Von
And say something positive, after all the negative shit
That we been through, thinking we’d talk one day
If it was meant to reservations ’bout walking up there
And getting in the way, it’s probably better off to just pray
Thinking my niggas a Don, it was my first time
At an over 1000 people funeral with (Security)

R.I.P (Security)
We love you, P (Security, yeah, yeah)
R.I.P (Security)
(Proof, this one’s for you, I love you Dudey)
Oh yes
This one's for those of you just ain't woke yet, hotep
You rich but you broke nigga just don't know yet, hotep
These rappers ain't woke yet, security back 'em, hotep
Hotep, come to Detroit with that, oh yes, that's a toe tag
Might as well have Mayweather back ya at a Black's match-up, protest
That's that "Write a check you can't cash," I might have to collect
That's that yo ass is bleeding, that's that Kotex
I massacre your whole rap allegiance, oh yes
This one's for little bro who big bro ain't come back from the store yet
Hotep, I'm here for blessings sent my direction, no less
This one's for those who don't know they pops not invincible yet
Trick bitches hoes that don't know just how nasty they are
They out here wearin' the same tongue ring they ain't change from ten dicks ago yet
Hopefully that scope on that AR don't take my focus
To places where I put fakers in comas longer than daytime soapas
Any calendar day I'll Halloween like late October
I'll bury these niggas up under the Devil's playground, playtime's over
Your bitch fine, dawg, I can't deny it
She tryna be my wife on the side, I ain't invited
I just, step over the ring and hit the bitch like Andre the Giant
Papa used to beat on me often for not being perfect
Thots used to call me tar baby, cops taught me that I'd be worthless
Mama gave birth to only one dark child like Rodney Jerkins
That taught me to focus on what's inside y'all and not the surface
I know my streets, I know my sounds
Y'all know my beats, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds
Nigga it's hip hop

Yeah, yeah, we started from nothing a couple MCs
Beat-boxin', the crowd in the lunch room
Me and Preem, both names go together
Like they ain't supposed to be separate like D&D
I said it before, I rep in records beats
At the HeadQCourterz, rest in peace
Nigga I'mma hold shotty, and knock you out
And I ain't gotta know karate like Afu-Ra
It's hip hop, strong or not
This is rap basketball, stats all you got
Long as you hot, and your flow can hold up
To knowing that all of your short goals is long shots!
Ninety percent of you niggas ain't hard
Here just to get a rep, you not Gang Starrs
The finest flow will amaze
Rap without me is The Source minus the quotable page

Hip hop is everything around you
No competition
Back to the voice of today
It's real in the field
What's realer than hip hop?
I know my streets, I know my sound
Y'all know my beats, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds, nigga it's hip hop

Rhythmically come on with it, I'm long-winded
I will diss you from long distances
You will not get the chance like Choppa
Ness and Dylan to disrespect, who you don't listen to
Egg in the skillet brain, nigga, this is you
Smarten up, every person in the Earth
Be hardened up but the only target is us
It's hip hop, cars and trucks
I be dreaming about shit like having a hard time swinging
On a nigga or squeezing a trigger or falling
If I land I won't wake up
My six shot model, ya crew
I'm leavin' ya momma faces blue like a Hpnotiq bottle
They feel you the realer you spit, this killer shit is hearin' us
Healin' you if you ill or you sick mentally, it's

Hip hop is everything around you
Gotta be something for me to write this
Back to the voice of today
No talent rappers
What's realer than hip hop?
I know my streets, I know my sounds
Y'all know my beats, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds
Nigga it's hip hop!

More venom, 5’9” is like a G5
Illest lyrics is stored in him
Chorus is killing, any warrior feeling
That I ain't God - Lord willing
Trust me after I crush ya building
You will just hush, you won't restore the village
We look toward with killing, real
Though this album is mor-bidly feeling to steel
Hip hop! Fuck your feelings
More rappers dying, much more killing
It's no feeling realer than gambling ya life
Everyday, and waking up to more dealings
Fourteen killings compared to offshore millions
Equals I got a lot more villians
You know that you easily lose, you be on MTV News
For the first time, because you died over

Hip hop is everything around you
Come alive y'all
Back to the voice of today
It's all in the game
What's realer than hip hop?
I know my streets, I know my sounds
Y'all know my beats, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds
Nigga it's hip hop!
(Hold up!)
Presenting to you, the President of the United States
The bullet being lodged an inch away from his heart, Reagan is launched into the operating room, and tells his doctors, ‘I hope you’re all Republicans.’

Cash rules everything around me
I ain’t claiming I’m street
I’m just saying everything that surrounds me is concrete
In the bubble-eyed ride all because I bubble like Don P
Right beside me’s a dime piece, college girl looking ‘bout as good as I sleep
That’s cause I keep it low, the opposite of high key
Y’all niggas got the wrong idea ‘bout what’s really going on, out here
Y’all weird, I see, they told you, ‘Keep your ears to the streets’
Y’all niggas laying down and y’all ears out here in these streets
I guess you took it literal
Guess the only code you live by’s forget-it-code
Uh, if I should get my own guilty verdict
May the next man learn from it, then flourish
You could put it on the news, you could put my face on the front of a shirt, then the latest video, then blur it
Y’all niggas fucking with the next nigga, bitch
Mostly attracted to her cause she the next nigga bitch
One of my niggas made a name for killing niggas
Now he on the slayin' spree for Dilla niggas, I call it the nigga nitch
Life is set up for you to dig a ditch
God is looking down on all, being carried by the crisp pallbearers
Like, just ball, player
You ain’t even gotta pull a trigger, you can still assist
Imma keep it real as this

Got to know when to row from the madness
Got to know when to give these niggas passes
Got to know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em
Got to know when to beats niggas asses
Got to know when the money ain’t good money
Got to know when somebody ain’t good for ya’
Got to know when to open and when to close
When being silent exposes, and when it’s golden
Got to know all the got to knows
Got to know all the got to knows

God made us niggas, then made us all breakable
Then gave us all decision making that’ll make or break a nigga
People tryna blaze with you, just so they can lace a nigga
All because of public sensationalism
With brothers with faces that people see and can relate to
When the place where the foundation of eating’s
Higher population is based on popularity
Gotta be careful where you place your wisdom
All it takes is just one conversation where you unbeknownst to the fact you’re talking to an abomination
At the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong crime taking place
That’ll put you away for a long grind, where it’s locked
Where it’s not safe unless you know them combinations
Yeah, it’s just a way a man to be taken by the same thing that took his brother
We don’t learn from each other, we learn to look the other
Way when one of us in trouble
That karma looking to catch you, it’s patient
It’ll wait till you think you would love to come get you
Cause  it know that women been the downfall of men ever since pussy was discovered
Dearly beloved, you soul searching for nothing
Just follow the instincts the lord versed you with, historically
That feeling that you get in your gut been getting ignored more than that poor person
Who’s living under the gun in this cold, cold world that we live in
That’s under the imminent control of the consumer and indigenous war merchants
More religion and more churches, doctors, more nurses
Cause it’s the American way to make anything that’ll finish you or drop you, for purchase
Who said I couldn’t buy my way into heaven?
All I need is a bottle, a couple dollars, a couple people that’ll keep me company
And who love misery as much as me
You got to know your pedigree, got to be yourself at all times
Your true self at all times ain’t gon hesitate to let you know when you should let it be
A lot of these brothers done died tryna follow their pride
Gotta know the alert signs, them butterflies as reliable as your first mind, genetically

Got to know when to row from the madness
Got to know when to give these niggas passes
Got to know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em
Got to know when to beats niggas asses
Got to know when the money ain’t good
Got to know when somebody ain’t good for ya’
Got to know when to open and when to close
When being silent exposes, and when it’s golden
Got to know all I got to know
Got to know all I got to know
Yeah, now you see what the Lord doin'
Rippin' pages out the book, I had to make the story fluent
Thanks to Marshall, I'm sober doin' what I enjoy doin'
I'm puttin Chavis Chandler on, had to at least pay it forward to him
Yeah, every other day another star is born
And that's to freshen the decayin' of the art form
Fuck with my commas, shit will be quick
Got what's in my pocket out of the dirt, filthy rich
I stuck to my promise to momma, stay focused
Double entendre, I'm tryna vocally smoke you, you will be missed
The hocus, the pocus, magician doing tricks in his miserable business
Who spit, loyalty, forgiveness through biblical scripts
Of morals and wisdom, paintin' pictures of this
Historical war of attrition who's just, the dopest, the wokest
I'm five years sober
Trauma from my childhood constantly haunts me 'til I finally cry tears over
Sharp as a gauntlet, with thoughts of my side chick in high heels
Cause I didn't want her, I needed her, though I didn't want her
I'm hot as July, no lie, I wouldn't lie in a sauna
Invest in the truth, don't expect me to buy into moments
They done took the charts over so now y'all scared of them shook niggas?
Jamal Crawford couldn't crossover and sell me them Wolf tickets

Uhh, "Best Rapper Alive" broadcasts in five
Four, three, two, one

I’m fly as a dive in the sky in a harness
Anyone alive sleepin' on me can die in pajamas
Police call me a threat to society, though I am a promise
I am a one-of-one like I’d say a Isaiah Thomas
You can’t fathom thinking deep enough to sink the abyss
You think you Pac, I’m thinkin' of sinkin' your Demetrius Shipp
Only thing that I can’t fathom is why the preacher is rich
How to think in the moderation and turn a drink to a sip
I'm private when I fly, I ball out like 'Bron do
You in the game but you sit and coach like Tyronn Lue
Me and my soldiers, we just out here mobbin' like old Italians
I'm snatching your homie's necklace to rock it with your medallion
Over these groceries, I’m toe-to-toe with your whole battalion
I hit you with four from this .44 like Hova album
I take lives like banned contracepts
All the contraband I collect is Iran contra-esque
Respect the mantra or die at the hands of consciousness
Run up and get left ran down to death on your damn conscious steps
The booze already made me lose, I can't go out like I’m Amy Winehouse
The Lord graciously still kept me here in a place to be
On the corner like baby Blue standin' in timeout
Looking real spiritually aware, pair of Pumas on
Looking like I’m aboard a Lear, headed to uniform
I’m so lyrically rare, I spearheaded the unicorn

I was born a bold one, sugar-coated on
The way I'm livin' put me in a great position now
Every time they hear me, they say, "Ain't nobody did this, nah"
And if they don't, they shit been off, just listen to the diction in this lyricism
I won't break a fool, they don't want me to blow
But every single show, they hand out like I owe 'em
Already paid my dues and wordings, uh
But if I said it then they still won't know, so I won't waste my time on you
And speakin' on the level that ya never on, the way they hatin' so incredible
My writings on the wall, to you, it's so illegible
I'm invincible, you're sleepin' on me, I'ma stay woke
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
We holla at 'em like

These niggas talkin' bout they walk, talk, and think bossy
I'm in the Trump Tower shower washin' ink off me
Two ugly bitches in my bed, moochin' drinks off me
My mini bar's empty, but that's just how I'm livin'
I'm in the presidential suite with two freaks
I call 'em my Kennedy Fried Chickens "Aww, yeah, I'm back, bitches"
But this is, kinda like my wilder style, vicious
Say when I'm sippin', I turn into Shallow Hal
I must have been high or somethin' cause I could of swore
That one of these bitches told me to buy her somethin'
I told her "I got a present for you right here"
(What?) "Actually it's not a present, it's my penis"
I'm feelin' plastered, so what they fat women
I feel like I have to bite the Apple like the Mac emblem
One of the bitches like, "Oh, I love you so much
I love Slaughterhouse, I love Joey, Joell, Crooked, all you guys"
Shut up "I don't like it when you talk" (What?)
"Cause that just means you're not suckin' my cock"
Bitch I'm on everything, I don't know what you just had
I'm 'bout to slip and fall and head butt your ass like Superbad
One of 'em started suckin' me super fast, the other one
I gave Arabian Goggles, they flier than alien model, for now
These bitches givin' me brains until I'm out of mines
That's when I had an epiphany like (Stop!) Vagina time

"Vagina" (What?) "Vagina" (What?)
"I wanna have sex with your vagina"
"Vagina" (What?) "Vagina" (What?)
"E=MC Vagina" (Come on)

(We holla at 'em like) I swear these little punks be wildin'
Claimin' they only fuck bad bitches, chopper stylin'
I be swimmin' in trash bitches goin' dumpster divin'
I met a bitch on the street, she said she want a nigga that's deep
I'm deep, I said "I'm the Indian Jones of explorin' crotch
I'm the Shakespeare of enormous cock"
I told her I got an 'oh so flow mean', rope-a-dope? Nope
I got a Poconos swing, little bitch riddle me this (Come on)
"What's the difference between a girl's mouth and a girl's vagina?"
(What?) "There is none, I want my penis to inside both of those things"
I know you gazin' at the words I text
I ain't a virgin, your wife ain't the first bird I pecked
She ain't per-fect, she per-plexed, she can't quite think
Your baby girl ain't right like birth defects
My religion is God body gynecology
I work with sex, feelin' no pain like Percocets
Sellin' syrup and wet in church and sweat
You herb niggas got me twisted like cursive text
Nigga I cling to her, I'll give her hella smoke
I'll sing to her, I'll tell her hella jokes like
"Why did my penis cross the road?"
(What?) "To get to the other vagina"

"Vagina" (What?) "Vagina" (What?)
"I wanna have sex with your vagina"
"Vagina" (What?) "Vagina" (What?)
"2 + 2 = Vagina" (Come on)
We holla at 'em like

"My dick is like an airplane, it gives girls orgasms
I'm the Wayne Gretzky of sexual stuff
I'm the, Hulk Hogan of slammin' muff
Love is for girls and gays (What?)
If you wanna be with me it goes one of two ways
Either you have sex with me, or you have sex with me
Girls love my sex, I'm a good sex man
Cause my sex is the best, I'm like Jean Claude Van Damme
But instead of fight people, I have sex with them"
(Let us pray)
Dear Heavenly Father, thank You for watching over us today. I pray for the sick and  and for those who have lost loved ones. Lord, I pray for the homeless. Lord, I pray for our soldiers and their families. I pray for everyone here today...

God taketh away, and God giveth
The clock's tickin' away as the plot thickens today
Cause I'm sippin' hard liquor
We couldn't suffer the same amount of losses
Cause my supply's bigger
Don't associate me with nothin' but that dopest child star shit
That Lindsey Lo', that Todd Bridges
Hit your block with a tickin' bomb that'll
Leave the competition in hospital
I'm the product of foolish pride
I'm a speeding bullet who responds to the pull of God's trigger
Jumpin' out the barrel, like "Excuse me, Nas. Move aside, Jigga"
I'm hard as proving ground bricks
Groundbreaking each time I spit words and they hit the street
You don't like the game, you can google my dick, bitch

And that goes to everybody
I pray for foes, I pray for hoes
I pray for everybody
But you can pray for them
If you gon' pray for somebody, pray for them

Don't pray for me, pray for Paris
Pray for Nigeria, pray for peace
Pray for your marriage
Pray your horse don't sway far away from your carriage
Why you put all of your eggs in one basket?
Blowin' dumb cash on Wraiths and karats
Your daughter ain't an heiress, I hope she's taken care of
More importantly, I hope this gun in your face don't end up in your mouth
I'll make you taste the terror of the kickback of this gat that could break the barrel
More court cases, hate betrayal
If I approach thee, boy, please take me serious
Cause if I say that I shall, then I shall proceed
I don't cry wolf cause I don't enjoy wasting tears any more than I enjoy wasting shells
I looked at the state of my health and asked the reverend 'bout it
I didn't just pray for myself, I prayed for everybody

But you can pray for them
They need you more than me, pray for them
Pray for everybody

Look around, look around, look around, look around
Pray for everybody, tell me exactly what you're seeing
I'm seeing children being murdered by police and then acquitted on all charges
It's like they're all targets, pray for them
Pray for everybody

Live from the gutter, my father's a drugger
The block is my mother, 2Pac got it on lock in my suburb
I got dope double-wrapped up in bubble wrap on top of my cupboard
Old ladies watching from shutters
Tellin' all the children keep watching out for us
Bad influences, we the gumbo that you see inside the pot
Swimming 'round in all the saddest, truest shit
Addict in the coolest whip
Riding 'round my city lookin' for the baddest newest bitch
Hammer in my stash, feeling too legit
90 on the dash, slammin' on the gas
Passenger mad, saying that the break pedal do exist
I'm saying "I'm late man, I got school to skip"
Introduce me to your chick, I turn this shit to a Skip to My Lou assist
I don't talk too much shit, I discuss shit by throwing hands
I'm a sucker for hoes in yoga pants
Tell my queen I'm in this shit, like kissing and holding hands
I keep my flings on the other end of a string with swollen glands
I'm a player, I've been to every hotel and every lobby
Every time I pray, I send up a prayer for everybody

Don't pray for me, nigga
Pray for them
You gon' pray for somebody?
Pray for them

Don't pray for me, pray for respect
Pray to get something different from rich and away from your debt
Nigga, I'm straight to cassette
Y'all digital, y'all about as physical as finger under some balls, coughin' while taking a test
Too many artists get mistaken with best
Cause they on the charts, you sleepin' on me, I'll come and wake you to death
While I pray against all the violence and shootin'
ISIS got Obama sittin' down with Vladimir Putin
I saw a child online ask his father "Why did they do this?"
His father then replied to him, "We gotta fight 'em with flowers growing out the ground"
I look at violence the same way I look at slavery
It's never ending in light of abolishment
These are my finest hours, then
I pray for everybody

Look around, look around, look around, look around
Pray for everybody, tell me exactly what you're seeing
I'm seeing children being murdered by police and then acquitted on all charges
It's like they're all targets, pray for them

(Let us pray)
Lord, please keep Your arms around us, and protect us from harm and danger. In your son Jesus' name, amen. (Amen!)
I'm ridin' with the K solo, I'm spellbound
Used to ride with Delilah and Nicole in the Fairmount
I'm who incite the riot, you the guy at the staredown
I worked at Taco Bell, now I just fire the shell rounds
Now somewhere in the air lies the truth like a thunderstorm
I terrorize the youth as if I'm gunnin' for 'em
I could've jogged here, I marathon the booth and let it run its course
The R's here I'm paralyzin' you like the underscore
Your riders couldn't impress my chauffeurs
Your favorite artist couldn't benchpress my notebook
I transcend like Wu-Tang, the R era's cash rules
Now I'm just dead nice, the pallbearer of bad news
Shouts to all my niggas out there in the locks of crime
Remember they can lock your body but can't lock your mind
You lack triumph when you stop the grind
You rappers Blac Chyna, went and got your bread and went and got behind
Gun professor, I'll punch whoever
Come here lookin' like Conor McGregor
Leave this bitch lookin' like Uncle Fester
Question, are we bitter rivals?
'Cause we can shoot the Ks or the fade
'Til both of our arms get vitiligo
I stay in my prime, y'all niggas just sippin' on scotch
I stayed with my nine, y'all niggas just live with your pops
I sit in the original lyrical pivotal spot
Even though I changed with the time like digital clocks
Either goin' straight for the kill
Gun-slingin' or I'm goin' straight up Jada and Will, I come swingin'
I write for B.I.G. and 2Pac
I'm rollin' like the prices on the coupe dropped
I'm dolo like a sniper's on the rooftop
I'm sicker though, I'm feelin' like the flu shot
I shit on every artist on the charts and leave a diaper on the jukebox
My mind's like the Japan bullet train, it floats in cycles
Rhyme full of pain, spoken right out the smokin' rifle
They wanna see me tweetin', "Yo man, who need a feature?"
I'd rather squeeze until the Colt jam like Lisa Lisa
I'm 5'9" givin' niggas them 6'9" fears
We can battle like them Grind Time kids
How about this, how about I take your wifey on tour with me
And never give her back, same way my nigga Big Sean did
I go hard 'til 2088, my father was crazy like Hailie Jade
StillI I was born a Saint like Baby Ye
I prayed hard and only God I fear
You just plain playin' God, lookin' like James Harden without his beard
These niggas hoes, man it's sickening
They only goals is get some golds and bitches and
Get on the 'Gram wearin' a Roc Nation hat
But anybody who's anybody knows
The closest they ever came to seeing HOV was....
But anybody who's anybody knows
The closest they ever came to seeing HOV was bein' witnesses
So run along with your little microwave hits
All you niggas is my light work like the day shift

Yeah, right now I'm finally respected
Until the day that I'm finally neglected
And I'm fallin', I'm callin' all kinds of pyrotechnical fires in the sky over Heaven
During my final eclectic spiral I die, right on the steps
As if I don't accept it
If it ain't green, I don't see it, I'm color-blind
With my eye on the exit, with my other eye on the double line
On the essence and any other kind of successes of the grind
Dominoes with destiny I'll forever be fuckin' fly
I'm fired with flows, top five and you know
I'm happy at platinum but I was happier
Back when 500 thousand was sold
My proudest accomplishment now
Was when I got quiet to get sober
And silence is gold
I let my whole story fly at no cost to the people
While I'm talkin' to Joe, no Budden
I'm talkin' Joe Walsh from the Eagles
No stuntin', we just wrote somethin'
My demise was s'posed to be weeks ago, keep your smoke comin'
I'm over here with 500 styles like a savant
You wanna see me washed, 500 pounds like I'm Avant
Hair dyed and all fried up like Yung Joc or Jaheim
Only way I'm goin' out is gunshots or sirens
We make paper, you party, we play Vegas
Nothin' but sirens surroundin' me when we play wagers
I'm fuckin' the bitch of my dreams and we they favorite
My BMWi green like DeRay Davis
I be givin' bitches orders like they mothafuckin' grandpa
Trappin' is for rappers, I be grindin' like the dancehall
I don't know astrology, I just know I'm a Cancer male
Eatin' south of France, he who doubts the man can't prevail
Back when Guru used to manifest the rhyme
I was known for nothin' less than just a candidate for crime
In and out of Ibiza, spendin' power, a Visa
Standin' the test of time like the Leaning Tower of Pisa
In my D-zone so the bitches gon' sweat it
Got the same piece of chrome Sweets loaned Bishop on credit
Got the Glock Craig used to help out Smokey and Day-Day with
The 38 Mad Dog used to pop JJ with

Everybody comin' with their hit record, big record
This gon' play in the clubs, radio, chick record
Either that or they come with a diss record
I come from where you don't disrespect none of your successors
I don't fuck hoes that I can't leave in less than six seconds
"Who the best?" is a horrible rhetorical sick question
You guessed it, I'm throwin' bullets at you, but you ain't about to go for long
I'll pull the .44 and let it bang like Post Malone
Might as well get ready for your tomb, you play me
Tell your wife she gon' be solo soon like Swae Lee
Quarter pills, recoupin' the deal worth a quarter mil'
All I'm tryna do is stay Black and get out like Jordan Peele
Everybody do it for the accolades, I'm tired of them
I ain't cared about Grammys since Jay boycotted them
Spent my first advance at Manny's followin' Pharrell and them
Used to ask bitches for ass, now I'm just tellin' them
If I get anymore fly, I'ma need my own space suit
Got these hoes gettin' naked like they high off K2
All I need is five minutes, every style get augmented
Well-endowed, in God's image, never smiled, Kawhi Leonard
These pellets of pedophiles comin' out this arm, bro
They touchy, trust me, Dudley, Arnold
My show start at 12 and it sold out by 11
Rappers blow up, then they debut their whole album on Ellen

Ain't nobody fresher than him, that dealt with more pressure than him
Never dealt with niggas whose image is skinny stretchy denim
Just remember everyone who with me winners
Everyone who with you dinner
Bitches switchin' quick as Bruce and Krissy Jenner
Chrome rims on the whip, just to shine on niggas
Black tires, the lip white, Tyrone Biggums
We givin' out turkeys on Thanksgiving like Nino with us
We even passin' out TVs like Wendy Williams
All I know is that I'm the wild child
Y'all don't want no smoke with these bars
All y'all niggas know is y'all SoundCloud
Let's hypothetically say I'm pissed
I would definitely AR grip, I would definitely spray off quick
Y'all expectin' me to hesitate to shoot this bitch
Then y'all are definitely in the playoffs with JR Smith
I'll definitely put my hand in your pockets but not the way you want
I'll put your whole family in boxes like y'all the Brady Bunch
I go bananas, too miraculous to react to mortal mammals
Cookin' crack in my new velour pajamas
Gettin' back to my roots rap where I store them hammers
Lore the grammar, my IQs my actual quarter-panel
My IP address is my dresser drawer
I ain't stressin' unless it's war, I ain't session, less is more
I bet you you'll die less of my iron's legend for regrettin' gore
Ghost whiter than the driven snow and it's headed north
Lookin' like it's four of the seven dwarfs, flows and metaphors
Bury skulls all over the globe like a Stegosaurus
Why these niggas gettin' their hair dyed and their nails polished?
I'm like Biggie and Pac trapped inside of Big L's body
I don't relate to common folk, they focus on the comments
So I'ma go roll a Testarossa down the coast of Monaco
Lo and behold your honorable, niggas is sheep
Niggas asleep, 'bout as woke as a dinosaur
My connect'll give you a whole kilo of coke
So he can go Geronimo
He should receive a trophy for bein' the Holy
Jesus of flows, he the GOAT
Baaaaaah, that should be my tag
I'm from the streets where the odds are not even
Robbery themin', ball, it's debauchery schemin'
Allah and Jesus, it's hard to believe
I'm a product of Eve in the Garden of Eden
Thinkin' how targeted we've been
Rihanna's stalker, I'm parked in her DMs
Shark in the deep end
Put these paws on you, I'll soften your defense
Hit your pause button, halt your critiquin'
Talk is cheap, the more I hear you talkin', it cheapens
And all I see is prey 'round the streets today
I'm 'bout a freak away from havin' Issa Rae eatin' out Lisa Raye
Any artist out that you see is great
Tell him I said bring his ass, better bring his A
Let his single play
We don't care what you sing
Hit you in your face with the butt of the gun
You leak and give your street credit a few streams
Pop go to weasel nigga fever nigga I'm the illest
You got pop culture fever, nigga
All I know is B.I.G. and Pac quotes
Pop toaster, squeeze the triggers, season tickets
Now I pull the cops over, give them niggas season tickets
Wifey used to shoot me down vicious, now she the missus
She turned me to a family guy quicker than Peter Griffin
I told myself when I was 14 that she the one
Now a nigga prolly got more seeds than Peter Gunz
Now a nigga grow up, my groceries in two-seaters
Used to roll the old-school, four speakers and two tweeters
Ridin' with nothin' but raw, quarter packs in duffles
Ryan writes heaters
Y'all niggas is cut like one of them Get Rich or Die Trying wife beaters
Me, I'm just all shoulder straps and muscle
If you're a hater, let's do it
I'll whip you now then I'll whip on your boy later
Them whippings'll go around like a tornado
I get rid of more yayo
I don't do Rodeo or ayos, I do the Floyd May-o
So many men shoppin' in women's section it ain't no ladies left
You niggas crazy, yes
You playin' crazy like the Chappelle sketch, Wayne Brady ep
I'm what you get when Freeway Rick and Cocaine '80s met
I'm bringin' bars back to the street like Jay and Nas beef
Broadcastin' Ether in HD at godspeed

PRhyme available 3/16
Since '99 I've been dope in this, focusin, unfocusin'
Sure as the sun floats and sure as the sun smokin'
I was the gun totingest, my cuz told me
Don't get demoted, keep it close to your digits
You know you get it, you let yaself get too close to 'em chickens
I said, "I disagree," then I let Superhead lick on me
Strokin' the kitten of Kat Stacks, 'bout to turn around
And write a book about both of them bitches
Next stop, to the top, I done went from A to X,Y
Almost at Z, chillin' at a rest stop
My new bitch, call her my PS3, you?
Your bitch pussy, call it my Xbox
Me, I'm the rhyme ruler, me and Denaun together
Deadly as Nas in his prime, you 'bout deadly as a benign tumor
Since '92, been a highly touted retarded truth
Prolly 'bout to Eli Porter-potty somebody booth
Never sellin my soul, I'm sellin' my skills
I'm on Rap's Radar now, Elliott Wilson
Painter of the underground canvas, even though
I can't freelance no more, the underground's famished
Before I settle for less then average, I'll swallow a watermelon
Follow it with a Double-Down sandwich
I swear that God told me
Slaughterhouse would be the second time around for me
All eyes on me, I know I'm not the greatest, I go hard
Your boombox is now invaded, Bogart, ha!
Look at me today, 8 years ago
I was popular for being hated, Solar!
Nickel Nine's the ruler, God combined with Buddha
Gifted oblongata, prized medulla
Each line's like a computer bomb designed by MacGyver
That only can be detonated by a MacGruber
I'm thinking if I ain't binge-drinkin' then I ain't livin'
Somebody told me I'm prolly dyin', but I ain't listen
By the time it could harm me I'll prolly die by a trigger
So I'm only goin' cold turkey, right after Thanksgivin'
I paint pictures between blank scriptures
Now just how contradictory is it that I pray?
The name's Royce and I be poppin' so much pussy
Dwight Howard look at me sideways
And while the bitches try to grab all on my dick
I can't even get my own nigga to rap on my shit
You form a clique, it should be sacred, I shouldn't say shit
Cause the Truth Hurts, like the bitch that Dre ditched
Nobody loves my niggas like me
Sober or wasted, for you there's no replacement
I swear that God told me
Slaughterhouse would be the second time around for me
All eyes on me!
Dramatic video of a Detroit gas station shooting leads to the arrest of two people, including the woman seen opening fire
Simon Shaykhet is live downtown to...

I'm barbaric to the fuck tards
I don't compare to the subpar
I'm here to see to it the mourning show
It's your funeral for your mom, plus your pa
I'm on the Russ Parr thus far, to us stars
This is just us rock, use a nigga guts for the guitars (put it on)
They getting bodied by an old nigga
Tell them nigga's their baby mamas tryin' to roll with us
I send it back, 'til you mentally raped
Trying to cut carbs, doing the butt to DeBarge
Fly nigga mayday, tryna touch Mars
Tryna get a payday like a nut bar
Tryna get my own island, fuck cars
I'm without a bus card, living in demise
The record label pimpin' him, cause the raps he be givin' 'em
He can actually deliver them and make a
Motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky
I guess I'm just a specimen with the literacy, special ability
I'm characteristically raised, for everything still paid for
Embarrassed niggas like Kimbo with the steel cage flow
No time to take it in, yet, I'm still thankful
I don't discriminate, I take it in pesos
Tryna to close my curtain, I was in Capers
Now I'm insured by the street, now my stint paid for
Stickin with the papers
Sticking to any shit that I say, bro
This is the Vince Staples
I clearly only target the bosses
Whenever we arrive at your office
I definitely body your authors
I'm Martin Shkreli, everybody audit the auction
About it and cautious, a product of losses
Living modest, dealing with problems
That the cars in his closet is costing
Niggas hearts turn into jelly the second that they have to part with their celly
Live life behind real bars
They don't know what it feels like to have a real fight
At night in the dark with your celly
Never take advice from the jealous
Watch your man, even if you got to watch him take an L'ie
You still gotta stand by him like you Omelly
The white girl got you bugging out like Liza Minnelli
My car's on fire, the tires Pirelli
I'm Martin and Eddie
Searching for Taral Hicks
Not to give her a baby, but to put a life in her belly
I'm barbaric with the nine and all
Am I in everybody's top 5? Not at all
You could find a nigga name in the ladies room
On a lot of walls, topic of vagina monologues
I write a lot of bars, that's why I'm poppin' like an adderall
I'm duplicated, more than Audemars
If you could take the beef home with you
You could make a goat out of ours
If you can take the bars and the rhymes home you can make a soap out of ours
These are breaks you had to be casted
Fatality to flattery flaccid
You bleed blood, I leak battery acid
There's no wrath that you can accurately battle me after
I'm that great
After Adam and Eve ate the apple
I evaporated, came back a cadaver
You can't assassinate me
Name: abracadabra
Guns is named Latimer
Got the little kids doing dirty things in the hood for me
I ain't talking about the same as the Vatican
If it ain't immaculate it ain't adequate
I heard your dog switching genders, ain't that a bitch
Banana clip on an automatic, take that and split
This that lyrical, acrobatic, straight savage shit

Straight savage
Straight savage
Ant Man what's up
Let's go get these niggas

The whole hip hop game need a rap lift
Surgery to the trolls and the catfish
Say my name five times, I'm showing up to your home
To your computer room and your blow up little mattress
In the big black whip
Let your bitch lick my dick sack five times and take her to Saks Fifth
Everything I say is like an 8th in a transit
And just waiting to wrap you in plastic for a rapper to come and take it and spastically pass away
She fucking with you
She definitely could fake an orgasm
She fucking with me
She definitely could take a giraffe dick
And I'm just hustling like I'm at a cabaret
Straight savage
Anywhere I'm goin' land is the exit
If it ain't lavish
I'm my own man like Stedman
I took my life into my own hands same way I take matters
Listening to Coltrane on average
With a no name bad bitch
Took her to my home, laid it down on the table
In powder same way cocaine gathers
Oops, I mean pounded her
You can either get down with us
Or let the ground come up and get you like Hank Gathers
Niggas think they've seen the things that I've seen
Just cause we on Instagram in the same glasses
Just cause we in the YSL same jacket
Doesn't mean that we're cut from the same fabric
What the fuck, is you high as hell?
You know nothing about the iron in the tire well
All you know about is the obvious shit
Like Kanye riffing or what? He'll probably yell
And I bet you probably one of the old creeps helping Kylie Jenner little body sell
Mermaids, water, good diver skills
Sandwiches in the Desert with a side of mayo
Transcriptions in the present got a lot of mail
Still getting money off the books like Galileo
I'm in the Panamera listening to Pantera
The bitch with me, sipping on caberna and >???<
I keep a narcotic in the car by the teaspoon
I give her a G-Unit, I hear she a fan of Yayo
I got to roll with a gat in the back
I get pulled over and they ask who I am
Oh, because the accent is black?
I tell them I'mma poet cause it's a dead giveaway
That I'm much more than just a Cat in the Hat
I be laughing at your guys while laughing at you
If you ask who I am nigga, I'm laughing at that
I'm a bullseye for time to laugh and attack
Kiss my ass and after that I put your ass in the crack
Speaking of crack rock, my pocket line with that
You could step on my pocket and break your momma back
Every weapon of pound I got is Floyd Mayweather
Doing a movie definitely ready to counter act
Got your bitch jumping 'round on the boat
Looking like when flounder flap
And it ain't because she found a map
We savages
If your bitch with us and you call her and she tell you that she tied up
She might be literally bound and gagged
I'm sick, I'm sick and permanent
Like the doctor opened me up and found a mask
Close me up, left inside of me an ounce of hash
I exercise for dumbbells hanging onto the gun rail
While I'm pressing up piles of cash
(A synth pad with heavy effects is heard, then a muffled drum beat that sounds like a live drummer begins.  The noise and shouts of a military group are heard as they engage in what sounds like an offensive attack.)

I said America the beautiful
Land of free, home of brave
Everyone is born and raised to think like a dead man
When you alive you the lowest on the totem pole
And soon as you die then here goes this
Oh, now he heroic
Oh, now he the coldest
Oh, now it's "he had that talent and I didn't know it"
Man listen, being humble ain't gon' get you out your grave
You should treat your life the same way you thinking like and go and whip it like a slave

What the fuck is arrogant?
That's the shit they injecting into us Americans
How 'bout I think I was put here to push European whips
And so what if you don't like it, I thought you'd be inspired
By the way I whip it, way I whip it
Way I whip it, way I whip it
I whip it
Right past the pretenders, the men with no passion
Who think it's possible to be past your potential like life has just ended
The spirit broken and so the wife and kids are born into only knowing the White Castle menu
While the richest born into white castles
Attending Bar Mitzvahs, the future of us niggas is in syringes
We meant for the NFL, injure the NBA
Anyway, I take popping shots at niggas over receiving posthumous props from niggas any day
Maybe y'all just scared, lost in everybody saying not to floss so you go watch the Walking Dead
Yeah you in the

America the beautiful
Land of free, home of brave
Everyone is born and raised to think like a dead man
When you alive you the lowest on the totem pole
And soon as you die then here goes this
Oh, now he heroic
Oh, now he the coldest
Oh, now it's "he had that talent and I didn't know it"
Man listen, being humble ain't gon' get you out your grave
You should treat your life the same way you thinking like and go and whip it like a slave

What the fuck does humble mean?
Call me good at something I'll say I'm good at a bunch of things
I feel my whole life my fire should be lit
I feel my wife's pussy wet each time she sees my dick she get excited by the way I whip it, way I whip it, way I whip it
She likes the way I whip it
I whip it
Man look here, I've been anti-corporate since daddy told me
That they force me here against my will
Without no horses or some land
Of course they saying I'm supposed to just forget they throw the scrap at those that can distract with those endorsements
Closing doors and all of those who buy the clothes and shoes
And booze and albums
Hope you not expecting treatment by the book
From he who wants you to forget that you was brought over here by the boat
I don't know why niggas say they money funny when it's low
Cause when you broke it's not a joke
Talk that we can't take shit with us when we die shit
You don't leave behind shit cause you died without shit
In

America the beautiful
Land of free, home of brave
Everyone is born and raised to think like a dead man
When you alive you the lowest on the totem pole
And soon as you die then here goes this
Oh, now he heroic
Oh, now he the coldest
Oh, now it's "he had that talent and I didn't know it"
Man listen, being humble ain't gon' get you out your grave
You should treat your life the same way you thinking like and go and whip it like a slave

If he's hot, expose him, then
Roll on him, we can't roll on him
Roll on his closest kin
That kind of behavior, I call that "Niggerdom, Niggerdom"
Mentally enslave them, taze them, then they go crazy
Uh, here they come
Everybody think a revolution coming
Wanna be involved in the riot
Everybody arguing out here, this how I feel:
"What in the Jiminy cracker corner fuck are we bickering for?"
This shit here is bigger than war
They sticking and sicken the shit in the food that the nigga consume so it's hidden in stores
Some shit that can kill your fertility, damage your thinking
Limit your abilities, think about that now
The fact that y'all living is crazy cause alcoholism got black people tapping out quicker than Savion Glover
And we ain't no Avión lovers
We dying each time that the Hennessy pours
Our plugs are the mothers on the other side of our umbilical cords
Can I talk my shit? Y'all niggas confidence dropping
Y'all letting people control y'all flow who don't know how y'all clocks tick
I'm disgusted
Find the money if the money don't fit
Do like me on this and find a different pocket
Only in America

Oh damn, I guess you is kinda talented
Make sure you don't forget where you came from, boy
Always stay humble
Now why don't you do that thing again with your tongue
You know that one thing when you go and whip it...
(*Whip cracking sound*)
I'll be shutting niggas up when I talk
But nothing's ever gonna get done to me
Y'all ain't gon do nothing at all
I'm gon be talking shit forever man, ever man
Shut the fuck up when I talk
Nothing's ever gonna get done to me
Y'all ain't gon do nothing at all
I talk about your ass forever man, ever man

Last name Voorhees, first name Jason
Like a loaded pistol, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
You don't want no problems, that drama be too horrendous
Fuck you and your feelings, your Momma the who offended
Pimping ain't easy, but bitch I'm in the building
I'm the smack man, I got a backhand like Serena Williams
He hungry like them Africans on the TV asking feed the children
Even though he be eating like he Sicilian
I sweat brilliance, I shit genius
You on fire till I come by you and extinguish
I'm distinguised, I'm bout to quit writing
You bout to grow a set of hooters while a nigga just winging
My dick swinging, it's slapping my leg so much the shit's stinging
You heard who better than me, bitch bring em, uh!
He stepped up like Rocky, he'll probably be finished
He'll go from looking like he Balboa to Rocky Dennis
You thought you was winning til every tooth in your mouth is in
A pouch in your pocket, the next time you talk to your dentist
These lame niggas say they bodies is endless
Get in my lane, they license to kill is probably suspended
I'm fly, feeling like I got wings and I'm in the air
I miss my flight, tell the pilot I said "I'll meet you there"
Cause he too rare, there should be a sign on every vocal booth
That says, "If Nickel-9 cues to do your beat, beware"

Last name, Pay Me, first name, Fuck You
You collect and call me by my alias, it's What Loot
Find me with your bitch my dick out, with a mouth on it
Take her round the corner a couple times, put some miles on it
Take her round monsters, OGs that used to be slaves
For Reagan helping to fund the Iran contra
Poster boy for gun rap, I got all kind of rhymes
Done about my guns cousin cause I got, tons of em
I ain't no, industry nigga, I don't do no events
I got some red carpets that's under my shoes in the Benz
He so street, when he do it, the sewer's his twin
He spit that shit, he should spit it into a depend
When it come to rhyming, I'm a Ducati, your dude is a Schwinn
I don't do parties and you, you just do men
My crew just too sick, your crew got pooper scoop dicks
My crew just drink and do chicks, nigga, y'all ain't gon' do shit
Slaughterhouse dynamic is Ortiz too mature for beef
Joey kill you with his words, me, I do it forcefully
Crooked is the smart one, but don't you get it twisted
That nigga there he will kill ya, I been to see how he living
When I brain storm actual rain comes
I am one with the streets, I Sam Cookes the beat until change come
My brain got different compartments, one it holds the psychosis, One it holds the explosives, one just got a note in it
That says on it, "Homie knows that he dope
He stay on his toes, he ferocious"
It's hopeless to focus on me with negative energy
You'll only lose your focus, I am not the best
I am death, now let God and Satan iron out the rest

Ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha
That's the victory laugh
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha
And since I can't do another nigga beat
Without y'all try thinking I'm dissing him
Shout out my nigga Drake
Now get the fuck out my face fore I fuck you up
(Mr. Porter)
Ryan Daniel Montgomery
5'9"
July 5, 1977
Detroit, Michigan
Porter, you a real nigga, man

It all started with a Starter coat
The starter pistol got us out the momma jokes
The house party finally started, now it's time to go
Get some pussy sponsored by the barber and a bar of soap
I'm stealing cars, it wasn't logical
But on the bright side, they taught us how to drive 'em doe
We used to tilt them bitches with screw drivers
So I'm kinda used to being at the bottom of your columns, ho
But the Billboard list was kinda comical
How the fuck was it designed and chronicled
I can see it now for sho'
Bunch of blasés from a buncha artists with a timeless flow
Gettin' trampled over on a 20 year old blogger flow
If 'Pac ain't on your list then you ain't fuckin' logical
I'm talkin' up the shit, not no fuckin' 5 or 4
What you gon' tell me when I tell you 'Pac introduced me to the fuckin' UNLV Starter coat
It all started with a Starter coat
Wonderin' why Brenda threw that baby in the garbage fo'
On my way to cop my navy blue Starter coat
It all started with a Starter coat
The starter pistol kept niggas out here from startin' smoke
Without it I'd be dead or be an artichoke
The 9 iron armor in the heart of gold (it's that fo')
Nobody witchu nigga that's the Art of War (let's go to war)
But do not forget you fuckin' start it doe (that's my mama)
(Woah, what kinda coat is that?) Starter coat

I grew up with three brothers
As soon as I was born my lungs collapsed
And I had to be hooked up to a ventilator

Now a nigga shining doe
Growing up I gave a lotta niggas shiners doe
I gave a lot of people my respect
Daddy taught me that one growing up
He threw me through a shower door
I used to wonder why my uncle looking startled fo'
Crawlin' around all on the ground like his heart is broke
I found out he got a crack problem and he thought he dropped a couple particles
Well I'm a fucking alcoholic so
Who am I to judge, I'm just honorable
I be temporarily in love when I'm inside a ho
I'm a pure artist I don't need to see the charts to know the art is under our control
Highs, lows, problems, pain, drama that's what's optimal
I guess I'm just the best at thanking God and feeling awesome doe
Cause I survived the era of the Starter coat
It all started with the Starter coat
I lost my virginity aboard the fucking Boblo boat
I ain't graduate on time
I ain't go to college so
A couple friends of mine did
Other friends of mine dead
I'm fuckin reminded
Just because I made the most money
That don't mean I went the farthest doe
I hope my college friends reminded
You got degrees that don't mean you the smartest doe
Mo' money, mo' problems
I lost plenty mo' marbles on my marble floor
Then I left in my Starter coat
What they taught us that was all a joke
You may not got a lotta dollars at least you got a post
I'm arguing with Satan screaming "I don't barter souls!"
Please don't take my memories of me and my Starter coat

What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
"It is obscene, it is obscene, it is obscene."
"In 1992 the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that it was more important to ban speech that is dehumanizing to women than to protect free speech."
"Now we see the direct and indirect effects. We see the rise in murder, in abuse, in battles, teen prostitution, and teen suicide. We hear the wailing mothers, the grieving sisters, the tormented brothers and fathers, and children planning their own funeral with pink dresses and pink caskets."
"If the filth that is portrayed in these gangsta rap videos and art is not obscene then I submit that nothing is obscene."

We started off as targets
We had the Congress mad at the whole genre
Tryna get rid of us
Now it's like we not even trying to be good
It's like we just sitting ducks in the eyes of evil
I open windows with hopes that the wind blows you ten mo' blessings
Set my Timbo's next to my dresser with the  Nintendo, and yes
The extendo's on the AK 47 and it's wrapped in the dresses of En-Vogue
It's time, it's time to move something
I guess we missed our window to try to prove something
Spot a whack producer from across the room
Walk up to him, smack his hookah across the moon
Break a platinum plaque over a rapper back
Go and toss that bitch into a dark lagoon
Go into the heart of the art form with a harpoon
They ain't skilled enough to stand the field with us
You gon' have to retire me
It's only like four or five of you rappers who can actually inspire me
I be out here telling the truth
I should sign my autograph with a polygraph
I move in silence tryna get to you 'fore you could brace yourself
Cause I'm tryna put yo' ass in a body cast
Y'all niggas lollygag, not me
This evening I'm with the biggest spenders having the most prestigious dinner
You eating Church's Chicken with suspicious fictitious sinners
I'm a living legend, you a fidget spinner
I'm getting cheddar, they tryna catch up to my past M's
And I'm getting better quicker, tryna catch up and pass Em'
I be blacking out, you could ask them
Everything I spit be sick, gag phlegm
Everything I wear be tailor-made to fit, Giraffe trim
Huh, it seem like everybody out here right now wanna be 'Pac
While I'm zoning, stirring the pot
I'm 'bout to go so motherfucking Lamont Coleman
This 'bout to be disturbing to watch
While I'm out here swerving the drop
Your favorite rapper 'bout to get cleaned up, served in a box
Like laundry detergent, pushing 'round these birds with a mop
Tryna stay in a genius, creative state of mind
Tryna stay sharper than straight sharks in a 'gator pond
Grate her down, all for the greater good and the greater grind
While they denying now, all these heathens be crying 'bout
Taking care of two, three dudes but these people be lying
We keeping it G, we keeping the iron out
They feed negativity, we eating vagina while
Keeping it Zion, we turning the streets of Detroit to a D zoo
Eating while we feed people to lions
The dude that I brought with me psycho and schizo
He think that he Luke, he like to lift you and make you skywalk
You don't wanna play with none of his make-believe truth
They'll make the iron speak too
He'll do the R2D2 to your heart
Until it's parts of a easel
Threw a piece of your heart in a jar for the people
To dissect at Juilliard
I'm the best at who we are, that's fucking food for thought
Nobody else been thinking like me thus far though
Subpar cerebrals

"For 400 years, profit came before principle."
"We marched for our rights to Selma, I was there with Dr. King."
"—music that glorifies and promotes violence with guns, knives, or drugs—"
"—and that includes all this gangsta rap—"
"—that's it—"
"—we march again and we're gonna keep on marching and demonstrating till it..."

I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
While I'm flipping pies like Patti LaBelle, Sara Lee
Eating all the bark with Gargamel off of the cherry tree
King of the dark art, all is pale compared to me
Let the hail from the evil word flip hath fury
While hip-hop stay colorful fruity like RiFF RaFF jewelry
I enter into a different intuitiveness on instruments
I just whiplash new beats
You just the next wave to catch a crazy catchphrase
I'm just a neck brace to the next crazy contestant who should step to me, neck pain
Tell paparazzi I'm charging sales tax to media
In order to picture these digits, press will have to capture Loch Ness
On the back of a hellcat or capture a meteor
Me, I left from the frying pan like the Devil's last ingredient
While Jesus wept I made boss music flunkies relate to
Better each time I came through like I held back the previous
Look, I'm the real thing
These niggas just here to provide dangerous detail
If any of y'all MCM's is any flyer than me there
These niggas listen to sign language, probably speak braille
Me, I'm just about to stick my dick in the dirt
Either that or a model, these Ether raps are the Bible
I'm gon' relapse for a bottle or be in the absence of Godot
Relax for a throttle
One of the last living rap forefathers who wouldn't ask for a dollar
My style lethal ferocious
Streaming out your club when your single drop
Like a single drop of blood off the beak of a vulture
Uh, I broke my key off in the car door
Just as I was on my way to score a quarter key off Artmore
I'm an angel at squalor
My threshold for pain goes farther than a marine who's been ordered to war
So at 3:45, which, by the way, is a quarter a to four
Somebody ask me for change for a dollar
While I spray your ass with four different fours
More layers than 44 sorting couture
Vocabulary lords sicker than Herbie's recording thesaurus
The Virgin Mary took a morning-after pill the morning before fornicating the Lord
They gave birth to me 44 days later drinking a 40 at the coroner's door
Therefore, this is more than just my dormitory
This is the safe place I come to look Benjamin in the face
So when you gon' end up getting ate like four and four
Icicles is made of blood-boiling water alluring gore
I'm here to combine all three Bar Exams for a fourth
While I shoot the shit as deep as foul goes though, so it's four to four
While driving a Ford wondering why guys look at me foreign for

"—we're beaten with billy clubs and we're bitten with dogs unleashed by Bull Carters. We will not tolerate injustice and insults from our worst enemies then, and we sure ain't gonna accept insults from our youth..."
Rock City

New casinos, car shuffles, numbers to bet
Disrespect and get a new smile under your neck
A city full of thug-ass niggas, and punk-rockers
A lot of niggas act like Pac, so cops watch 'em
Them shot blocks up in the black or the light Timbs
White boys look, act, and rap like Slim (hi)
Fight Music, knife users never respect it
Guns talk, high schools with metal detectors
A city full of Tommy Hearns thumpers
Grant Hill hoopers, Barry Sanders runners, stunners
Chaldeans with weed-connects like whoa
Type of weed, no need to test like 'dro
Type of cats who got dough, they like - so?

Fuck
Let's get it started like transmission and alternators
Got the keys in the cage ready for who you call the greatest
Takin' 'em down from the biggest bitches to smallest haters
I'm 'bout to serve these niggas, call 'em waiters
Got my mind right, money right, ready for war
And I got the C4, under my competitor's car
These niggas runnin' 'round talkin' 'bout they better than moi
When I'm done all that's gon' be left bitch is ya head and ya bra
Bitch I'm the head of the pack, and I'm ahead of the game
And I put yo' head on a platter you put some shit on my name
Bitch I'm the shit, see the stains that I done left on the track?
And I ain't sayin' no names but I left the best on they back
And they ain't sayin' no names so I gotta say it myself
I'm finger fuckin' this game so you gotta play with yourself
Don't pull a K off the shelf, or pull a strap out the stash
I ain't gotta draw the pistol, I'll be clap at yo' ass
I just let the hands of God toe-tap on you fast
Leave you mashed like potatoes on the top of the grass
Call the coppers to catch me and they'll just tell you to drop it
I'll find you sooner or later and they can't do shit to stop it
Got that thang and I'mma pop it like a bubble on the double
I am trouble in the flesh, you can't see me with the Hubble
We ain't wishin' these niggas good luck, go get a clover
This Bun B, it's "B.E. 3," this shit is over

SLAUGHTERHOUUUUUSE! (Whoo, Kiiiiiiiid!)

Look at ya man look back at me, yeah I know, sickenin' huh?
If you got a Porsche with only two doors, need to upgrade cause you missin' some
We just got two different bills, different styles, different sums
Started as a drive-by, ended as a hit-and-run
Stop me in the streets, let it be properly when you greet
Fuck lookin' for me, I'm on your property if it's beef
Not for robbery of ya piece, it's lobotomy with my peeps
That comraderie is usually sodomy for the beat
'Less my critics put a lens on them, so I could look through it
Shut the fuck up, probably mean that you too shook to do it
We'd see two pennies to your name, yet you so saucy
When I fix this game you can Thank Me Later for it, no Aubrey
Switch my demeanor up I'm, off my 380 shit
My, future's bright, stars is by my head, Baby shit
Make me sick, what you eat don't make me shit
Found out the reason they hate me is my God-like presence, must be atheist
While all of the frauds in rap is talkin' swag put a fork in that
Slaughter's back, listen nigga I got houses all across the map
Even got a Boston pad, got this bitch from Boston bad
Well put her in a wrestlin' move, but I heard she got that Boston Crab
Batteries in your back, go by what he say
Just need you to know that it's no lee-way, and the tables are turned, go DJ
So you know what that blindfold's for
That bloodshed's a secret, let's keep it behind closed doors

Who you said was dope again?
Ay, it ain't nobody fuckin' with us, nobody fuckin' with us
Who you said was hot again?
Ay ay, it ain't nobody fuckin with us, nobody fuckin' with us
Who you say could spit again?
Ay, it ain't nobody fuckin' with us, nobody fuckin' with us
Who you say was dope again?
Ay ay, it ain't nobody fuckin' with us, nobody fuckin' with us

I'm the present and the future
Like Christmas in 2012 I'm the present in the future, an executive producer
You will never get to choose ya destiny cause you a pessimistic loser
Mess with me and I'll definitely shoot ya
I'mma do's ya like I'm reppin the Yakuza
Die hard like I'm sexing with Medusa, do something nigga
Born thuggin', I don't fuck with the cops
Nuts hang down my pant leg, balls tucked in my socks
I ain't gotta act tough to get a couple of props
Little nigga raised hisself, I don't know what's up with my pops
Do I think I'm the dopest in America? I do
Make you switch your whole style like you're datin' Erykah Badu
Pair of Ferragamo shoes, I will stomp you
I'm fucked up, like the relationship between Farrakhan and Jews
I'm spankin' this instrumental, like a wrinkly old bitch
I'm whippin' the kick and snare, make 'em pick they own switch
I'm smarter than computers that know how to fix they own glitch
I'll leave you face down, like chicks who lick they own tits
And from this day forward, Crooked is aging backwards
Gettin' younger and fresher, puttin' bums under some pressure
Yes sir! Watch the next Slaughterhouse album
Every line is white powder, I ain't talkin' 'bout talcum
I am tighter than "The Biggest Losers" cruisin' in a Smart car
Distinguished alkie, the flask on the armoire
I'm from the home of the most popular bomb weed
Most proper, hoes rock with my partners who top seed
Po' vodka, we gon' bottle pop in the calm breeze
No copper can stop a COB star - I'm a giant
Dumpin' my cigar ashes out on top of the palm trees
Chrome chopper, if I squeeze you drop on the concrete
You wanna' talk about the paper? Oh let's do it
Batter pocket syndrome, the money we gon' abuse it
Still gettin' out-of-town paper so don't confuse it
Tell the hip-hop cops nah, it's only music
And haters steady eavesdroppin' on "The Bar Exam"
Probably in your trunk now dependin' on what car I ram


Flow tight I should probably ghostwrite for your idol
My pen game is God-like, I could write for the Bible
I'm so good, that after I rock it tonight
I'mma go Sexual Chocolate a drop the mic
Don't even attempt to stop me, mention me, top me
My pencil is nice, should only mentally be dropping the dice
I'm a speech beast, you best to not approach me
Matter a fact I think I second that emotion like a re-tweet
My stock goin' up like a Lamborghini door
I feel like Chuck Woolery in the damn Bellini store
You playing yourself you remind me of the lotto'
You was good and then you turned hood, you remind me of Moscato
I don't aim, I'm like Dick Cheney
The 4 spray and light your head up like Lo Pan when he gets angry
This ain't Simon Says, bitch, this what Ryan says
I hit the track and it's a wrap like Aunt Jemima head
I'm beyond out of my mind, if you can imagine
Usin' Magic's johnson without a condom, I'm bonkers
Yeah, got the streets goin' "dude is tremendous"
If I come for your blood I ain't gonna be usin' syringes
I am raw, there is a difference between I and y'all
You opposed, you throwin' fire balls at an iron wall
The sound of Alan Grunblatt signin' his name on the dotted line
On that paper is your favorite rapper signin' off
Baby! Baby!
Damn, slow down a little bit
I just wanna get to know you baby
You know what I'm saying?
I don't wanna bite you, it's all chicken except for the bone
Shit, I'm just
Hey, I'm getting a little money out here
I just wanna spread the wealth
You know what I'm saying?
I got, I got money, I got credit cards, I got PayPal cards
What ever you want to do, we could do EBT
You need groceries?
Shit baby, what you looking at?
What the fuck you see over there?
A Unicorn?

Niggas sweat bitches
While bitches sweat the chill nigga in the sweats
If you don't get no respect
It really don't matter, you could be Louis Vuitton'd up
You might as well have on Von Dutch and Tommy Hilfiger with a debt
I don't do dirt, I don't call scenes
I send niggas through to leave a mess

I'm a real nigga in the flesh
I will find a bitch in distress
I will make her feel so alive
Then beat her with the dick to death
Real nigga in the flesh
If shit ain't right between us
We will leave a nigga left
Real nigga in the flesh

I despise rapping niggas
Y'all niggas fly private, I come sky jack you niggas
You disrespect me, I'll get on board with three Ks out
And go to your PJ's pilot
Tell him I need those jet's keys like I'm DJ Khaled
Seems like every artist out there snorting coke and smoking base
I just opened up the briefcase and dumped out the contents
To close up an open case
If my soul shall rise then I'ma lift the hood up like Tray Martin
I'm a clapper, they targets
They trappers, I'm a convict slash escape artist

Real nigga in the flesh
Finding bitches in distress
Make 'em feel so alive
Then beat 'em with the dick to death, yes
Real nigga in the flesh
If shit ain't right between us
We will leave a nigga left
Real nigga in the flesh

I'm p-o-p, you d-u-d
You bark up this tree, I'll make you turn over three new leafs
You live right by the code or get left like three two three
I'm A Tribe Called Quest, I'm the new G
Out here going dumber than Tweedledee
All these youngins wanna redo me, like these movies
'Cause I'm so Pablo Escobar-esque
Elephant in the room, never out my element
Oh, always on my P's and Q's like RSTUV, ah!
Never tell your intel to a gent who's intelligent
'Cause he'll tell a friend who then shall attempt
To turn bullets into shells and spin, and turn humans into skeletons, grrah

I'm a real nigga in the flesh
Finding bitches in distress
Make 'em feel so alive
Then beat 'em with the dick to death, yes
Real nigga in the flesh
If shit ain't right between us
We will leave a nigga left
Real nigga in the flesh, yes

I'm breaking now 'cause I'm dating goddesses
The haters tried but couldn't feed me salt
'Cause I seasoned all them, now I'm raking dollars in
Say goodbye, I'm finna take you outta here
You can't deny it, I'm the H in igher
Here the four door Porsche or whatever vehicle
A nigga like Lincoln couldn't survive without made it out and over four scores and seven years ago
I know time flies by, yours tick-tick-tick
Mines went-went-went-went like eleven layers ago
My flow so heaven sent
When I go to heaven, I'ma go "Heaven here you go"
I'ma go tell God, "I know I promised that I'd never steal your flow," I lied
Ain't nothing like side pussy on my dick
Word to the motherfucking DJ Quik
Bunch of girls wanna have a bunch of relations
Even when a nigga wanna be they friend
I learned that faithful women need they men
They don't really wanna leave they men
They just don't wanna get a phone call
From another chick saying where he done been
If your bitch 'bout to leave better ask yourself questions
Like "fight for her? Why?"
You better step up and fight for her like you're fighting for Hawaii
Or you motherfucking B.J Penn
I'm a real nigga in the flesh
My wife almost left me but she ain't do it
I don't like the way "ex-wife" sound, that don't got a ring to it
I guess I'm not typical which is cool
I guess I'm not hip as you which is cool
I guess I'm not into the shit you're into which is cool
Nigga you's a bitch and your bitch a dude which is cool

I look around and all I see is fools
Some of y'all got street cred, some of y'all got pre-approved
Some of y'all got red carpet rolled out for y'all quick as you
Drop, went right from a Honda to a box 62
They dance and they ballin' and they zonin' like they Victor Cruz
Labels only care about hits and views which is cool
Not only am I the alchemist, I'm the evidence
The wicked witch is cool, the cause of her demise
Reminds me of this jet I'm in, a flyin' residence
If you don't write your own rhymes get offended this is to you and you
Listen fool no more bars for you
You can't raise the bar, you ain't in the buildin'
Matter of fact you can't even lift a stool, fool
That liquor disappear from my system like skippin' school
Me and these niggas live by the same don'ts but different do's
To get they name out they willin' to get the lube
That Balmain fit me like my religion true
Call my assistant tell him I'm slippin', I'm spittin' jewels
Somebody come out and get them like them Memphis dudes
We independent, while y'all flash bitches
We in the trenches, ball sack lickin' addiction, y'all need interventions
The gas pedal mashin' the carpet in them SL Benzes
The dash retarded like the special olympics
The needle leanin' past the finish line like Lance Armstrong
I'm exotic smellin' like your baby momma vagina, bonfire island
A Creed Avensis
I'm not a killer I'm just stricken with a sickness called homicidalitis
Flat screens surround me and my dubs seat up in my whip
So she can read her twitter mentions in three dimensions
It's no such thing as flossin' if you ain't never seen the dentist
But some of y'all need to take them gold slugs out of your face
Load 'em in the pistol and shoot 'em the fuck into outer space
Maybe I ain't rich as you which is cool
Maybe I ain't weird as you which is cool
Maybe it ain't a style to be lyrical


I don't give a motherfuck, I just get your mother touched
I pick my own date, pay my way, call that double dutch
I grip the ass, I dump the tip, call that shit the double clutch
Wax on, wax off, clean that ugly stubble up
Bonsai, truth is gonna un-lie at sunrise
Your makeup's running, Uber's gonna catch you when it comes by
You boys are entertainment, I understand you like the bitch
But you are pretty famous, sweater like the one Cosby
Wore at his arraignment, uh, I stay patient
Pray gracious, made milli's, while billi' racin'
Now they wanna trade places, as my ceiling raises
My prime lays dormant, they computerized, not I
See, I'm straight torrent, I clock in, write it with my pen, out my acorn
And then I clock out, and leave a black cloud on all eight corners
Started with us to hear the pop loud - Robin Harris' House Party
I bet y'all acquit it, like a child killing cop trial
All you see on the ground is an empty rock vials
Like Tommy Lee and Pam Anderson, I'm  in the Trump Tower
With this here piece manners here, Magnum condom fit, like Juelz Santana
Bandana gear, I used to need antifreeze
She about to need antifrizz, antifrizz
I'm Pac and I'm Nas when I famed danced to anti big
I'm not a star, ho, I'm on Uranus on a pantie binge
Far as are as y'all aside, from flaming all of y'all
I feel like I fathered all of your bars, like I came up in your granny's crib
The most interesting man, on the god damn planet
Beef is having a nigga's bitch, fix me some god damn salmon
Beef is trying a nigga's clothes on, when he ain't home
Beef is your wife, when kids at school, texting me "They're gone"
I just took a dip in your swimming pool, which is cool
I think, you need to find some more comfortable slipper shoes, which is cool
Trust the fucking shooter

Y'all emotional gangsters, 2016 Emo G's
Millennials, from the means streets of beefing through memes tweets, and emojis
And Blogs
Sleep on me, I'mma see to it that you see more Z's
When there's beef I don't call niggas
Niggas call me and when they call, call the police
If he ain't grow up wit us
We'd John Doe 'em
We John Doe
A nigga quick
Leave his frame tore up, shit
Even Jane Doe her if she with him, Jane Doe a nigga's bitch
But I ain't aim for it though
Gun powder and cocaine for my cane corso
I came into your home
Openin' 4-4's
Even though I came in full clothes
Death in the air got me laying mo-low
You could pay for protection
Whoever you with when you disrespect payin' for it, though
The lord is my shepherd
All the people is sheep
Call me the anchor
I come from the bottom
I'm deep when I speak on the violence reporting the evil I see
I know what you thinking
Here we  go, another song about a nigga who got a gun but it's not
It's a song about a nigga who don't got a gun getting shot

So many flows, so many flows, so many flows
Niggas close so many so so many so many doors
Nothing brings a nigga to his senses like a fucking bustin' Ruger
The rabbit got the gun now, nigga
Trust the fucking shooter

Trust the fucking shooter
For you back out make the moves
Shit I've seen this happen a million times
Uh, right, long live all the hustlers that come and cop with straight cash
Long live the plugs that show love, but still got class
Death to the ones get it on their arm and run off with cash
Long live all the goons who get half just to find their ass
Line your fast, you could never minute past rapidly
Long nose, think sneeze at you
You know a nigga sinus bad
Ten nine, you never mind to rag
I sit and wonder how much mind you had
Long flight, had the time to lag
I came from cross the road, to cross the globe
To off the load, to get all kinds of bags
Proceed
You know when I go I OD
Me and my Co-D
Like Orenthal and AC
Roll a Fonto
Got the Bronco lit
Uhh, four-fifth
One four-fifth
Seatbelt strap
Eyes focused

Long live the one who got the gun in his hand with his own plan
Long live the grown man with no gun but still he knows the land
Long live the one truest

So many flows, so many flows, so many flows
Niggas close so many, so so many, so many doors
Nothing brings a nigga to his senses like a fucking bustin' Ruger
The rabbit got the gun now, nigga
A women's loyalty is tested
When her man has nothing
A man's loyalty is tested
When that man has everything
The definition of a legend
Is a man who starts with nothing
And leaves the game with everything

Legendary
That shit there gon' make you legendary
This shit here gon' make me legendary
Make me legendary
This shit here gon' make me legendary

Pardon, nigga, I'm the hardest nigga out
The farthest nigga out the party nigga, I'm the artist
I put all these niggas in the garbage
All these niggas in the toilet
While I sit in orbit, I'm not getting better
I'm just getting started, started I'm just getting
I just flipped it like I do all my competition
Let me slow this shit down
I just need me a bad one
Come over here and wear my flag hon'
I give y'all the bottom line, I don't do a lot of talkin'
Cause a lot of talkin' take up a lot of time
And I don't got a lot of time
Since a kid sittin' in the wicker chair
With the sweater with the collar out of mine
I swore a lot and swear to promise to cut the line
Swear not to get out of line
I can't have 'Pac in my closet, I don't got time to idolize
I just cop it and toss it
I don't got time to itemize, my flight is high
Probably the only thing around me tonight that's high
Besides my I-D-E-O-logy
Pockets chubby, I should say tubby
Cause I'm ballin' like Dr. J
Wonderin', "How could they sub me?"
I certainly got comrades like Conrad Murray
Who operate ugly from around the way
I'm lookin' around at these pretty girls, and this what I got to say

Ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad one
That's that shit gon' make you legendary
That's that shit gon' make you legendary
It ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad bitch
That right there gon' make you legendary
That right there gon' make you legendary

That's that shit gon' make you legendary
That's that shit gon' make you legendary
I ain't tryna fuck every bitch that's tryna fuck me
That shit right there just ain't necessary
All I'm tryna be is legendary
That right there won't make you legendary
I remember I was just a pimp
Save all that extra shit
You bitches' neck'll twist quick as The Exorcist
Just tryna catch a glimpse, bitch I look excellent
Soon as I exit, I peel out advantage
She try to look hard cause her ride lookin' small
We will suit up and boot up and get out like Mexicans
All you niggas do is party all the time
Party all the time, party, party, party
Once you my target, I'll stop you while you're startin'
Started, why you stoppin'? My niggas clock around the party
Around the clock, wearing choppers 'round the .40
And rocket launcher down the block
Mwah! And they ain't got no lawyers
That gon make 'em fuckin' legendary
That's gon make you fucking legendary
Beautiful women asking "When we gon' get together?"
I told all 'em bitches "Nevuary"
Now all them baddest bitches know to never come to me with nonsense
Cause they know that I will fuck 'em once
Like a record company then drop 'em
Hold up, that's that shit gon make you legendary
That shit gon make me so, so, so legendary
'Specially if she acting suspect
And the pussy just end up being so, so
I'm just a superhuman being with the quickest slow flow
Got the underground wire, like the tires low pro
Got the eye of the tiger inside of the mind of a, old soul, yo

It ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad one
That right there gon make you legendary
That right there gon make you legendary
It ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad bitch
That's that shit gon make you legendary
That's that shit gon make you legendary

That's that shit gon make you legendary
That's that shit gon make you legendary
You get more for your money when you fuck with Mr. Porter

Hello
Hey Lincoln
Hey Porsche what's up
Hey baby what's up
Nah nothing much, what's up with you?
Nah nothing, got this broke ass nigga outside
Oh y'all about to go out? Hang?
I ain't going out for long
Probably cause he don't be blowing no good
Naw baby he ain't like you, he don't be blowing no good
Haha well shit I got hotpockets in the oven, what you need?
I wanna see you later
Well my son do got a basketball game later on, but that lil nigga ain't even starting so
You so crazy
Yeah I'm...I can save that gas, I'll be through there

I been waiting in this bitch driveway for an hour my nigga, hell no
There's only one way I can fix this problem my nigga, that's sell dope
I ain't come in this bitch to politic or rub elbows
Even my own bitch know I'm mentally unavailable, I'm busy, I sell dope
I'm focused, I'm focused, I'm focused on three things
That's go and buy three chains, that's fuck your bitch at my earliest convenience and sell dope
When I'm with her she creeping on you, when I hit it I hit it with my phone on speaker phone
While she's moaning I'm still tryna, tryna sell dope
My teacher asked me what I wanna do when I grow up, I told her "Bitch, sell dope"
She told me go to the principal's office, I went to go sell dope
I don't care about y'all, what y'all wear, where y'all been
All I know is I'm fresh as fuck from head to toe
If you don't like it you can get the fuck out my car
Go over there somewhere and ride Pierre Cardin (You rude)
And when you see that bum make sure you tell him I said that I sell dope
For all the times I was dead broke
Speaking of dead, when I die, I swear I'mma try, I'mma still try to sell dope, sell dope

There's no other life out here I know
So I guess I should...
Sell dope
This is the only life for me
So I...
Sell dope
The nights are long and cold
Long and cold
But out here on these streets you'd swear I had pure gold
Pure gold
In my hands I hold your hope
Nigga cause I...
Sell dope

This bitch told me I can't get them digits my nigga, my nigga, aw hell no
It's only one way I'mma fix this my nigga, that's sell dope
A fan asked me for a picture, I squatted down for a jail pose
Then I dashed before the flash could finish, I forgot I had to go sell dope
What news you got, if it ain't about selling dope, I can't take it
The doctor gave me five months to live, I told her "Nigga, I can't make it"
Tell whoever set my expiring date I had a prior engagement to sell dope
That's why I'm in every discussion, I could sell a whale a bucket
Of well water, I could sell Harriot Tubman a mothafuckin' railroad
I'm the flower with the thorn rising out the concrete, y'all just born on Melrose
I stay strapped, I stay strapped like velcro
When I meet new people I introduce myself as "I sell dope"
I just had a job interview, they asked if I ever been to jail before
I said "Yes" then I got up and left, like fuck this shit I'mma sell dope
Cause right now I'm dead broke
Speaking of dead, when I die, I swear I'mma try, I'mma still try to sell dope, I'mma try to sell dope

There's no other life out here I know
So I should...
Sell dope
This is the only life I know
The nights are long and cold
Long and cold
But out here on these streets you'd swear I had pure gold
Pure gold
In my hands I hold your hope
Nigga cause I...
Sell dope

America, America, God shed His grace on thee
America, America, when will we all be free?
(I say it every day of my life God bless America)
Somebody very dear to me just attempted to kill herself
And showed me we don’t fear death, we fear fear itself
Ever since 98 in hip hop my presence been felt
Couple dollars, couple models, couple of bitch niggas under my belt
Thorough nigga, I'mma hold you to it
If we hand shake my plan B is to complete plan A
Grindin been my strategy like this is my anatomy
I should get a tat on me that say why, why, why
Would you let some dollar dictate your army
I brush my shoulders up, polish off
Haters if you play me I’ll spray your potato layed up with fakers
I put them in the news in a major paper
My roller coaster of a career, hope it’s been real for you
Because it’s been weird for me, I feel like

They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah

I just want mama to be happy
Is that too mothafucking much to ask?
Damn it I’m about to cry in this bitch, king of the jungle
I hate liars but I fuck with a lioness bitch
If you don’t straighten your ass out right now
I will find you and iron you bitch
Grindin been my strategy like this is my anatomy
I should get a tat on me that say why, why, why
Would you let losses make you act like a faggot?
I’m a fly and you act like a maggot
Money comes money goes, I used to wear funny clothes
Hammer pants, my mama used to wipe my runny nose
My real family all I care about is her, I’m feelin' like


Then I watch my daddy hit my mama, listen to my mama
Tryna calm us, y'all don’t understand the problem that we have
Who gives a shit about dollars when you gotta go visit your father in rehab
You said Rick Ryan Marcus as long as I’m getting high your mama will be sad
And only I can fix this so I'mma turn this all around I promise
As we sat He said i’m down in life right now you know I'mma be back
And when he got back home it’s like it was heaven sent
Cause I was only 11 at the time and he's been clean and sober ever since
He gave me this advice, you at a huge advantage
Long as you know what’s rules in life and a view for the planet
Rather you the man, you’re the mechanic people treat money like oxygen
When they got it they take it for granted but then lose it and panic
So spoken G, I look at him like Superman
And y'all know niggas ain’t even close to me so if he can fall, so can we
Somebody lift me up, yeah
And give me a hand
Give me a ride, I'm sliding off the highway
There's a curve in the road
I don't know when I'm going, crazy


Verbalizing my theme murder
Communicating while you debating using machine squirters
Br-r-rat, that trigger's my tongue, I l-l-lick a nigga
That fo'-fifth'll,lift a nigga whole clique up
The Lord call for your soul, it's time to go, pick up
Answer the horn, it's blowing at you, you cold, stiff up
My heat, heating my whole hip up, all we do is court strippers
Your metal freezing like it's a morgue zipper
I, ride around with Preem
Not the Preem from Queens, but the Preem from "DWYCK"
'Bout to change the game, 'bout to fly the desert
Eagle for y'all people, like the wing's the clip
And the barrel's the beak, my apparel is fleece
I'm adorned in diamonds, I'm a pharaoh deceased
Like if Spawn was rhymin, and I would advise you
Not to tempt her, New Temptations, the gun harmonizing


Every bullet's a note, I write with a firing pen
Every time that trigger pull, it's a quote
Inside a booth fulla smoke, sniffin lines of that gunpowder
I'm hotter than a pair of boots and a coat
And a turtleneck, the best rapper alive
Could be the best rapper that died, I'm murderous
If you ain't get it by now, I'm suicidal, I'm wild
A nigga better than me, is who I ain't heard of yet
So I ain't murdered yet, he ain't even been born
His momma's a virgin, she ain't even fertile yet
Prepare to get back, next time you take a shit, stand and turn around and look in the toilet, then compare me to THAT!
Don't compare me to none of these muhfuckin' wannabe hustlers
Tough until they standing in front of me duckin'
It's off with yo' head nigga, 'less you one of them Dodgers
We sound off as one, we gun harmonize!


This shit is musical, my spit is beautiful
And if the best rapper died we'd be sitting at Nickel's funeral
But we ain't dying cause our trigger finger nail you
As quick as you clip a cuticle, hollows'll hit your follicles
I split your wig from far away like a long arm barber
Then lift your weight like a strong arm robber
Put that on Moses, I rely on my rod
As sure as Satan's tongue lying to God, everybody dying
It's like you standing in a circular firing squad
Singers for hire, I find him a job
You see the gauge baritone, the revolver's a tenor
Way the shots spin your body, I'ma call 'em "The Spinners"
Call 'em "Earth, Wind and Fire", put you beneath the earth, wind and fire
Feel the fire that burnt Richard Pryor
I'm keeping two guns, I named 'em Romeo and Juliet
Make you take five like you and your homies on the movie set
BLAOW!
Yeah, I got money on my mind, that's why I'm twice on my grind
I'm nice cause I rhyme like it's my life's on that line
The second that I'm provoked, I snap into a point
That ain't controllable, then it's either war, or another quotable
Don't let me get a hold of you dudes, I'll murder you on camera
Get Kelly's lawyer and get a mole removed
I probably shouldn't have said that, fuck y'all, on the record
Off the record, if I'm on the record I'ma off the record
I need a push when I'm tired of rhyming, go 'head
Diss me, 'cause me and George Bush got a lot in common
We both got no sense, we love to go to war
And we stay looking for weapons of mass destruction
This industry is Hilary Clinton literally, listen
You ain't got no choice now, roll with a nigga
If you twisted enough to picture a devil mixed with a angel
That's sick, drunk inside a Range Rov, that's this
Wish I could stick every rapper in this bitch in a building
Let 'em cypher while I fly a plane through that bitch
Cause I hate y'all, I'm tri-polar with the 8 ball
If I want you on my album, I pull out the K and make y'all
In case y'all wanna share my light, I'm gonna tell it like it is
Fuck it, it's my Jeremiah Wright
I'm a motherfucking problem, I don't care if y'all don't like
Times three nigga, I'm me nigga

I'm me, nigga

Big dick, bitch, big balls
We the kind that supply the rock like Chris Paul
The same kind that aim 9s, insane conscience
And then we get rid of the rock like Dwayne Johnson
Ladykiller, the fly version of Orenthal
You ain't got no DUIs then you probably a cornball
Wittiest, if you call a laptop a labtop
You sound like a scientist, but you probably a idiot
Your stories ain't holding up, y'all niggas lying
Got me thinking y'all either too young or y'all ain't old enough
Niggas saying, "When Royce gonna stop beefing with rappers?"
Bitch, when hell freeze over and Wayne sober up
By the way, fuck all DJs! I'm just kidding
I just threw that in there to get y'all attention
No intention of ever dying, nigga, life too sweet
Two words for who don't like me, "fight" and "me"
I take care of my family, they say
"Do the kid rock like Pam Lee?" The answer is yes
And I invest, it takes money to make money
So I make green off Green like Stan Lee
Smart shit, I ain't got beef with no Joe Budden
Y'all gon' get one of these niggas killed trying to start shit
Niggas hire muscle 'cause living is a privilege
The only rapper I admire for his strength is Xzibit

I killed it, right away
Soon as you cross, go 'head, you got the right-a-way
Give a nigga iron like vitamin, play
I will ride up in broad day and night a nigga day
Drunk! I'm a recovering outpatient
You at the top, you shot, your spot is now taken
Psychotic is the ploy, how the fuck you rapping and you gay
And you've been spotted with a boy like a Dalmatian?
If I switch up, I'd probably be instantly selling
Got a clip full of pellets known as MC repellent
While you talkin  bout your money and how I can't have none of it
I'll hit a nigga low, just for the Zab fun of it
I will never lose, never lost, I'mma prove it
Except for my virginity, but I was trying to lose it
I be on some Tom Cruise shit standing on the couch
In the club, laughing bout my dime new chick
She the shit, but if you ask her she useless, I'm in the pocket
'Cause got a rocket down under like Houston
So I'm gonna keep being me and you should keep being you
If being you offends me, indeed, it's gonna be me and you
But understand that if it's that, it's either gonna be me or you
So pump your brakes before I do you like a got a key to you
Shut your power off, I'm a G-A-N-G
S-T-ARR, yes, we are, bitch, I'm *gunshot*
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah

See I done said so much (so much)
I done said so much that I don't even got that much to say
I done cried so much (so much)
I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away
Quiet

That’s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)
Silence be the same color my chain is (quiet)
That’s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)
Silence be the same color of my watch (quiet)

Hold up, shhh, keep your mouth shut
Them street sweepers will come through and clean your house up
Us Detroit niggas call that yellow-taping the scene
My south niggas call it chalked up, you know
We put money on it when it's real, they call me Mr. Fifty a head
I'm sending ten niggas to kill ya at ten until
Every man got an expiration date and a price
All my revolvers got the spinnin' wheel
I make the Lord you pray to appear tonight like Vanna White
Them racketeering charges startin' to look like a tennis deal
I caught it, garden in my backyard guarding the weed and lookin' like some spinnish spiel, but still I'm dealin' raw
From selling to buying weed, actually I'm stealin' all
I'm the last of a dying breed that I'm out here killing off
Four of my closest friends don't know their papas so I pull out rows of dollars to show 'em these real forefathers peelin' off
Get money

See I done said so much (so much)
I done said so much that I don't even got that much to say
I done cried so much (so much)
I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away
Quiet

That’s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)
Silence be the same color my chain is (quiet)
That’s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)
Silence be the same color of my watch (quiet)

Shhh, I should have been born deaf mute
Talkin' get you stripped naked
Shootin' at your feet, dancin', till Chippendales at your rescue
If there's a wrinkle then there's iron to press you
Look, time is money, I'm on EST
Keep playin, light up your block like Christmas E-v-e
I'm the new edition of poison: BBD
For that bread my niggas will stamp you: EBT
I let a hot line sting 'em, you and the cops while I'm singin'
Ever since you left the city, now they hotline's blingin', hmm
Seen a paddy wagon cruisin' and I'm deducin'
That they are only movin' cause all the rumors that you in
If I had to draw a conclusion all the gangsters we losing is
Because of the illusion, you are not in collusion
With the boys that's wearin' blue and it's causing all this confusion
And they wouldn't even know, but y'all tellin' what niggas doin'

See I done said so much (so much)
I done said so much that I don't even got that much to say
I done cried so much (so much)
I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away
Quiet

That’s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)
Silence be the same color my chain is (quiet)
That’s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)
Silence be the same color of my watch (quiet)

I'm going on an AK-a-thon
Throw a Bible at some shallow waters right before I go and pray upon
Double parked, custom license plates says I can pay a fine
I ain't in the zone, I'm in the mother fuckin' lay-up line
Speaking of lay ups, we do homi's based on how we doin'
Last lay up line I was in was a body viewin'
I'm preoccupied with the Earth's ills, good 'erbals
First meal was milk, I milk these niggas for my first meal
Full circle, off of just talking I can tell types
But I still give that bitch my whip test
If she not exhausted then she can easily tailpipe
Playin' that dirty hand I was dealt, don't complain to me nigga, tell Christ
I'm standing over coffins with hammers and screws, with a sickness
Man a cure wouldn't hand a nigga these nails right
Only hand-me-down I had was inherited head lice
But nothing's more bugged out as my head size, I live twice
E'ery day, one for the body of Martin Luther King, I'm dead nice
Rest call me Malcolm, they want me dead because I'm dead right
Ask me to spell die, I'mma accidentally spell dice
I can shelve a label with my shelf life
I'm a rider, but still I steal bikes
Out of the field, terrorizing reptiles and field mice
I'm cut like I'm touched, a blind man with braille spikes
I'm deep, I could break up a mother fuckin' whale fight

See I done said so much (so much)
I done said so much that I don't even got that much to say
I done cried so much (so much)
I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away
Quiet

That’s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)
Silence be the same color my chain is (quiet)
That’s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)
Silence be the same color of my watch (quiet)
(Ryan!) I am not trying to be in the store all day
Y'all can play the game one time
Lemme go get change for a dollar real quick
Hey my man, what's up, you got change for a dollar?
What's up, man? You don't remember me, do you?
(Ryan!) I remember you, I remember you definitely
I remember you took my basketball and wouldn't give it back
'Cause I dribbled it inside the store but I was just messing with you
Plus that was my lucky ball
My Dad got it signed by Isaiah Thomas so I kept it with me

Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used bounce that, bounce that ball
I'm little Ryan from 16650 Baylis
Remember me? I used to buy all the mystery mix Now and Laters
I used to wait for God to come down and answer all my prayers

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing (Ryan!)

Same little boy used to walk to the corner store
Who used to get the Funyun chips, who ended up, dumb, young and rich
I had young parents but they both were strict
I had a superstitious granddad, wait, scratch that, crazy granddad
I seen him turn his hat around three times
Drive his car around the corner three times in reverse
Just 'cause he crossed paths with a black cat
Man, you remember Hank? He used to be a Jitney at the market
My Mom used to do his laundry
He used to have me and my brothers dyin' laughin' at him
Talkin' 'bout, "You know you can't leave them clothes
In the washing machine too long when they get done washed
And still put 'em in the dryer, doing that makes the clothes stink"
Damn, being back here bring back so many memories
You sure you don't remember me? You remember the ball? (Ryan!)
Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used to bounce that, bounce that ball
Nigga, everybody know little Ryan from 17150 Northlawn
I used to come and cop pork rinds
I used to watch drug dealers come through in cars
Like, "If I get one of those, it's showtime"

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing (Ryan!)

Is that Ryan? Is it always good to see him in the neighborhood
Hey, baby! How your momma?
Look at that car, he done done it
I told y'all he was gonna do somethin' (Ryan!)
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (Ryan!)

Wow, this is overwhelin'
It feels like it was just yesteday I was watchin' "Good Times"
Wishin' I could get ahold of Thelma
Fighting with my brother over channels
I like watchin' movies
He likes stupid shit like Robin Williams goin', "Nanu nanu"
Whatever that stupid ass show called
I ain't around here being no attention whore
I need niggas to look at these whips for every time we got those extension cords
God, I miss my big brother so much
He went to prison so much that I don't think I'd recognize him these days much
But I'ma always know what to get him from the ice cream truck
He used to get the Push-up Pops, I used to get the snow cone
I used to wanna be just like Turbo, he used to want to be Ozone
I got all the kids wavin' at me, all the elderly off they high horse
They wouldn't even let a nigga play twenty-one in the driveway
Nowadays the ball is in the my court (Ryan!)
Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used bounce that, bounce that ball
Everybody going, "Ain't that—little Ryan, from over there on Morlow?
I ain't seen him since he was a baby"
Well I'm back in town to let the people know
That you don't need no lucky ball, you already amazing
And I'm still your neighbor, little ol' Ryan (Ryan!)

And God bless the child no matter
How long it seems, somehow he'll find his way home
It's so important baby
Between the memories and family, I don't know which one is more amazing

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing
Then I keep my .40 Glock on me. This has no safety on it, it's fully loaded, there's one in the chamber at all times, so that means if I need to, I just aim and squeeze

Everywhere I go, them niggas know I'm ready for combat
All you ever gonna find in my DNA is combat
Everywhere I go, these niggas know I'm ready for combat
Nothing but violence and rage in my DNA - it's combat

I don't got comrades
I just ride with the gun, cash, and a good girl that's gone bad
I don't have to have a hit, shit could be a bunt
I'm ready for combat
This ain't really what you want
And I ain't really fascinated with your 'Benz price
Fall back and get your car jacked while the engine masturbate the twin pipe
I beat you down
Only time you heard about me backing up is the armoured truck beeping sound
Instead of battle rapping with you, I'd rather speak in rounds
True veteran, Sickening flow you couldn't do better than
Show up to your crib, dig a six foot hole, introduce you to your new residence
Y'all what all the flash and all the autographs about
Y'all niggas actin' like broads is all your fault, that Remy Ma the hardest rapper out
Y'all only do music with people 'cos they hot, so your point is stupid
I just wanna stay the fuck away from you and do a joint or two with Joyner Lucas
Shut the game down
Show you you ain't shit when I come through
Don't even flinch at me - I'm James Brown
You ain't built to fit in that jump suit
I'm super strapped with a rocket launcher - Google that
Lay a hand on me
I'll spray you and your homie
Have you land on him like Scoob and Scrap
I'm in the streets where the movers at
Y'all industry, y'all industries where the Ubers at
I'm ruthless black like Dr Dre crew
Rae Carruth in a topless grey coupe
Got the K cocked, stay true
The roof is back, get in the car
Never been a star, but I'm blessed
I found a girl who love me almost as much as Peter Rosenberg loves Kendrick Lamar
I'm just tryna be the one who finally make Rihanna faithful
Was I the only one heartbroken when I found out French Montana fucked Sanaa Lathan?
And I promise y'all I'm not a hater; I'm just aggravated
I just want all my hoes who don't know that they my hoes yet to act their ages
I just want to drive all my hoes crazy like the one that played That's So Raven
Back to back with me blasting iron, ratchet waving
Caps flying like we had a graduation

Everywhere I go, them niggas know I'm ready for combat
All you ever gonna find in my DNA is combat
Everywhere I go, these niggas know I'm ready for combat
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)


I got real nigga in my DNA
I be killing at will
I'm the illest that live
Fuck a deal, fuck a VMA
I beef, y'all mediate
Y'all PDA, I'm TNA
Soon as one of y'all step by the bar I alleviate
Niggas must want death by tomorrow, if you trying war with me today
Y'all niggas story long, not me; I abbreviate:
I innovate
I'm NBA
Y'all CBA
Gettin' paid my TV rate
My reality BDP
Evil D, I'm CTJ
Y'all DVD
Y'all reality Stevie J
Y'all trying to box with a nigga that'll beat your ass, but I'd much rather beat a case
Just shine your light on the world
So shine your light on the world
No matter anywhere you go, keep
Shining your light on the world
Don't let the money make you thirsty
Don't even let it be your goal
Just let it come and keep on working
And shine your light on them hoes
Cause I'm the hardest nigga out here
I'd rather die than live a life of fear
I know I got to be down here
To shine my light on them hoes
Hardest nigga out here
I'd rather starve than live a life of fear
I feel like God sent me down here
To shine my light on them hoes

Lost in the world when me and my girlfriend meet, bless you
You know they say "if you fucked her and she didn't cum
And you came, then she fucked you"
We squeeze first, nigga these ain't rebuttals
These street sweepers, we dump til he jump brooms
Like these nuptials, in the D where dreams come true
This is the the story of a man who's trying to break his doubts
Down like his cases count
Obsessive compulsive counting dough
Making sure all the numbers on the inside
And all the faces out
Lawyers on retainers like they braces out
Say my name wrong, I make you taste your mouth
Money come, money go
Get it but don't splurge it
Your boy's greed and war's needs
Got their own purpose
There's more than four speeds on that Porsche Turbo
It's sitting on four G's like my phone service
I'm out here trapping, but this here's sincere rapping
Dear assassin, you can't kill a signed and sealed classic
Cause L's and bill blasts, snake skin troops
Reptile enemies X'd out is what make men true
I'm blacking just like Jamaicans do
I'm running long side your coupe
Tapping guns upon your Wrathe window
Like Ox in Belly, got more Glocks and cellies
Than New Yorks got blocks and delis
Cops and boxes of pirellis, their doors' ajar
Exposing  my maserati's guts
And that's what got you jelly
The car I'm driving got a pot belly

I'm out here trapping
With this here sincere rapping
I've been shooting straight
Since two inch tape
This is for real classic
And getting money was never part of my goals
It just came along with me shining my light on them hoes
I've been out here trapping
With this here sincere rap
For fifteen years, I ain't leaving here without a classic
I get money, get money money dough
All I came to do is shine my light on them hoes

Hip-hop is my house; watch these philosophies win
Around artists I stand out like I locked my keys in
I forgot my goal at twenty-three was make a classic
Walk away like Tiger with my nine iron then take the master's
They say that you get what you ask for
Well, I asked to be left alone with my pen, pad and passport
This ain't no rags to rich brag shit
In fact, it's more close to being a rich to rags story
The fabric I'm cut from's the most genuine article mankind offers
I'm like an underground landmine talking
For Storch, Hammer & Antoine Walker
And your boy's a tampon
In every store I'm anti-corporate
Highest exalted, call me commercial? I'm highly insulted
This is Royce da 5'9", mind body and soul shit
All I have in this fucking globe is my shotty and flow
I'd rather let the coroner outline my body in chalk
Than let the fans order me 'round the clock and buy me in bulk

I'm out here trapping
With this here sincere rapping
I've been shooting straight
Since two inch tape
This is for real classic
And getting money was never part of my goals
It just came along with me shining my light on them hoes
I've been out here trapping
With this here sincere rap
For fifteen years, I ain't leaving here without a classic
I get money, get money money dough
All I came to do is shine my light on them hoes

We move in silence, y'all ain't hearing us coming
I was sent by God to provide that imperial sonnage
Ya'll assembly line of rhymers really don't want it
I'll eat you for breakfast, one by one I got ya'll serial numbers
I'm about to send a tweet out to my nigga Styles
Tell him he got the juice now
Call my OG Scarface, talk some boxing with him
Perhaps these new clowns, politic perhaps
About a new him and Royce track
I'm feeling like D to the O to the C
When he got his voice back
Ha, I'm feeling like Cube in a fresh El Camino
Rolling key low g rolling through Detroit's back
Streets waving to all my people
I'm feeling more at home than Reese Taylor
This are what memories are made of
I remember each grudge, each favor
Each lie, each judge, each bailiff
Each job, cheap labor
Each neighbor, each caper
Each Mosque, each Church
Each pastor, pew, and casket
Each future bastard double dutching  through the madness, singing:

Just shine your light on the world
So shine your light on the world
No matter anywhere you go, kid
Shining your light on the world
Don't let the money make you thirsty
Don't even let it be your goal
Just let it come and keep on working
And shine your light on the hoes
Cause I'm the hardest nigga out here
I'd rather die than live a life of fear
I know I got to be down here
To shine my light on them hoes
Hardest nigga out here
I'd rather starve than live a life of fear
I feel like God sent me down here
To shine my light on them hoes
Never write about me like that
Never make me stick to one, it’ll just make me angry
Never ever make me no underdog
And never talk about who’s gonna stop me!
Ain’t nobody gonna stop me!
Ain’t a heavyweight in the world fast enough to stop me

Yeah, I survived a lot of savage shit
I’ve been vibing like it’s Attica
Bulletproof glass is on my ride, ride around here like the Vatican
I’m an addict, I personify arrogance
I believe you can speak some shit into existence, deleted my 9 to 5 narrative
Now I got a bitch so fine half the time I fuck her, rest the time I just stare at her
Letting the non-believers know I don’t need to go diamond Ryan, it’s forever bruh
I’m a level up from buying stilettos to impress em
Got em blindfolded, tying em up in leather like I’m Edward Scissorhands in some boxing gloves
Hitting it just as if the chick was with the S&M S&M, I ain’t never stressin em y'all are the nervous wrecks
With ya ho fucking me, both hands stroking the pole looking like she tryna roll up a sleeve, I call it the turtleneck
Next, I blow out her back while she sitting vertical on top of dick in a convertible
Call the shit murder the vertebrae then drop her off at the crib with vertigo
I done seen it all, been through it all so you know I know what is what
The smallest part of beef is gon always be all the things you utter bruh
My sense is keen and I got that ivory weighing on the triple beam while I dish a queen
The bitch got the Arsenio Hall from “In Living Color” butt
I got your baby mama hyperactive, piping her while she asking the lord in Michael Blackson accent “Lord, what in the mother fuck?”
My mind is so much more enlightening, who be tryna throw shade? I’m over here just destroying y'all sun
And this is what you call in y’all bag, then I’m in a Goyard trunk
Baby I’m getting cash money, getting the last laugh, the last word too
I’ma need my headstone to say “y'all finished or y'all done?”
Bar Exam 4 y'all, the there is no competition edition
No features, nobody scratching on it, this the I just been itchin’ edition
Ballin’ like I’m in the A-Town with Terio in the bleachers
Y'all are karaoking with Dirty Harry, tearing your stereo into pieces
Y'all need to take a soul searching class
The Slaughterhouse album I’d like to drop it, the New Edition biopic came out and now Joe wanna be Bobby so fucking bad
I’m just joking with my good friend, I’m just so in my happy place
I just know from my head to my toe I’m the greatest, y'all can keep ya ho and ya accolades
Dr. Dre taught me to not oversaturate before he offered me a deal
Right before I got another offer for a dollar amount you know that I had to take
And now that all of that shit is clearly behind us, y'all really expect me to regret being 19 and going and getting a million dollars?
Nigga fuck you, that’s a million dollars, still a million dollars
Nigga that’s 20 million nickels, that equals 20 bitches and an island
Now you’re talking unlimited dimes, and a hundred million pennies
Now do I wanna pitch it down? Hell yeah nigga that’s a million dollars
Now can you get the fuck over it? Please, consider respecting me, I’m willing to fucking pistol bust over it
As a kid I used to just be looking pitiful
A lot of my courses were difficult, so of course the teacher would tell me I ain’t bout to be too much more than just a custodian
And that gave me a complex I’m still stricken with I call the shit the Napoleon
When I walk in the kitchen now I want the ho to kiss the toe and lick the linoleum
All my old bitches before you slit your wrists if you can’t stomach it get some Imodium
Gassin’ bitches and spittin’ petroleum
The only actual difference between me and the Holy Spirit is the Trinity and the podium
Nickel Hallelujah
Nickel-9ne-Alooya
Nickel-9ne-Alooya
Hallelujah nigga Hallelujah
Nickel-9ne-Alooya
Summertime were the funnest times
Momma used to had to say come inside like a hunnid times
Flat booty, big titty bitches just on they grind
My nigga Moody used to say they was built like the number nine
Hah, wish I could be childish for old times
Either y'all were Tranzor Z or y'all were Voltron
Stole bikes with Ike until the time that he stole mine
Told mom, she told me, "What comes 'round goes 'round"

Stop, right (right there)
I never said that life, was fair (fair)

Look, we had our best times when momma and papa went out
And someone like my auntie would watch us
She just smoked weed and want not to be bothered
We go and leave the house to not be by her
She was our favorite, she never would holler
She get high and give out several dollars
Every time she get the camera, she'd tell me to smile
Knowin' damn well I was never no smiler

Stop, right (right there)
I never said that life, was fair (fair)

"Hey girl, how you doing?
Yeah, Greg's in there getting dressed, how are the children?
I see you got you a new car
You know just gettin' along, gettin' along
Ryan is doin' well, uh, girl I gotta go Greg is callin' me
It was good talkin' to you baby
I can't stand that bitch, ugh"

I said stop, right (right there)
I never said that life, was fair (fair)

Look, same girl that Momma just was talkin' all fake to
Used to borrow our papers, and all of our things
She was always ungrateful, always had bad news
Always into the latest gossip
Always was tryna show our father her nudes, that shit's not cool
One day we went out in town and they broke the door down
On our house and stole all of our food
Stole from us, we ain't have much more than you

Stop, uh
Stop right there
You know when karma catch you
Everything in your life goin' fail
You gon' be a failure
You gon' be a failure
Said you gon' be a failure
You gon' be a failure
We gotta move
Die, bitch, die, hoe
New God flow, no I go
Diablo, why, hoe?
Why, bitch, do time tick?
Think about it, you die slow
If not you die quick
I’m sicker than Theraflu
Wickeder than a kick over headstone
Sippin' on redrum
After I'm finished just swimmin' inside of the dead pool
After I'm finished just inflictin' on the guy a despicable head wound
Nothin' is important, but to import tons
On my fourth run while I'm eatin' lunch with my forked tongue
I swing this motherfuckin' barrel loose
I don't fuck with knives, nigga, I'm Sardo Numsie
Y'all niggas call the police on my people regardless
Rock a bye with my piece then call it Keisha in Harlem
I'm the highest of all beings, my eye is the all-seeing
Dribblin' fireballs with lion paws for my audience

What if the Devil played the banjo?
What if he invited you out on the dance floor?
There's one of six million different ways this can go

Ayo, your fishscale Fisher-Price
First shot killed a nigga, but I hit him twice
My trigger finger itchin' like it was lice
Sent the white in a pot with the ice, whipped it nice
Hurricane whipped the whole slag
Fiend hit the glass, hit his ass, you know the math
I toe tag me a nigga, you know I spaz
I throw a bag to my young nigga, he'll get it over fast
G-wag, 24 karat
Silencer on the Mac 12, you ain't even hear it
Lightning strikin' on the Neil Barrett
Fuck nigga don't get embarrassed
Fuck your two Sarah's out in Paris
Bitch nigga, your life, you better cherish
Ten shooters show up to your show just to air it
Griselda, the dinner place swingin'
Body in the Bentley truck, shit reakin'

What if the Devil played the banjo?
What if he invited you out on the dance floor?
There's one of six million different ways this can go
(So go fast)

Eyes are the windows to the soul, what your secret is?
Once had to battle the reaper, and I ethered him
No tellin' what I'll sing on the mic, he got reefer in 'em
Ghost guts, I can see a ghost, and speak to 'em
Buildin' with the dead like every other night
And I never write a rhyme, I recite my other life
You thinkin' this a verse, but it's more of a testimonial
So flow, up in the zone, only the lonely know
Thinkin' I'm geekin', but I'm reachin' my dead homies, though
Told 5'9 if I have a nine to five
I'll line rappers with the nine and rob em five times
Every day, seven days a week, call it crime time or
Thirty-five licks, nigga, that's a prime rhyme
Fightin' Bruce Lee's demon, but I'm agin' like fine wine
You don't understand me
Cause you don't stand under the code that mean family
Ghost is uncanny

What if the Devil played the banjo?
What if he invited you out on the dance floor?
There's one of six million different ways this can go
I made a choice (woo!), I'm rolling with Royce (yeah yeah)
Ooh yeah, yeah (yeah, woo woo!)
Everything is everything but I need a better ring
I'm married to the game so I got both of us wedding rings
On every finger, T-Pizzle the wedding singer
We only make head bangers, I'm leavin' 'em dead and I ain't scared

It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I was panickin' yesterday, now I'm happy as hell
We on (I just do what I do)
We on, yeah (I just do what I do)
It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I'm turnin' back up my radio
I hope I never be alone (I just do what I do)
Be alone, yeah (I just do what I do)

Said it's the first of the month, got bitches callin' my phone
Just payed a couple of bills, just got some shit cut back on
I gave my momma some money so she can go out and gamble
God only put on me, what he know that I can handle
But it's the first of the month, I'm puttin' some rims on my car
My lady said it's a waste, bullshit I'm a star
Leave me alone
She jealous anytime I'm gon' shine
She said, "If you so talented why, nobody ain't ever heard of ya?"
She dumps me on the 20th, takes me back by the 30th
She's wrong
But we been together such a long time

It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I was panickin' yesterday, now I'm happy as hell

That's from the first of the month until the seventh
And from the seventeenth to the end, it's like Heaven
We go from buying back to selling
Ayyy, I live like a king
By way of delivery of a mailman
Oh no no, hello

I'm tryna' be loyal to never going broke again
The money, the power, respect is my only three friends
So I put a ring on the game, I'ma put a chain on it later
Now I got the hang of the game, I'ma make it rain for ya baby
Now, I put the work in (I put the work in)
So if anybody asks about me, just tell 'em I'm workin' (tell 'em I'm workin')
If you not talkin' 'bout money then you get the "do not disturb" then (do not disturb)
Talk down on the game, get one of them nerves in
Uh, if I ever fucked up a friendship—I'm sorry (sorry)
Money don't buy happiness, I go and cry in a Ferrari (skrt)
We get kicked out the room, I'ma move the shit down to the lobby (yeah)
'Cause I got my bag in the mail, I'm happy as hell, bitch it's time to party
And it's the first of the month

It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
