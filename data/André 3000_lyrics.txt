Me and my mother drivin' to the grocery store
Me ridin' shotgun with my window rolled down
She smoked cigarettes and gets what she gets by
Hustlin' harder, rollers and a nightgown
Me and my father driving to the football game
Me ridin' shotgun, my window rolled down
He sipped Cognac and kept us all laughin'
I was much happier when he was around
When he was around
Zen, he was around


Around
Around
Around
Me and my mother
Me and my father
Me and my—

We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby

Miss lady
You could have been born a little later but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs
Same here, and actually I think that's funky
(In a Claire Huxtable type way)
Miss lady
It looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
So call me when that big ole house gets lonelyfied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun

Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view

Chronomentrophobia, the fear of clocks
The fear of time...

High's the cost of living
I take what I have been given
Pastor say, be strooong
Hooo yeahhhhahhh
I ain't' got tiiiime
Leave me aloone

Ain't that much time left
I've got to funk you now

Chronomentrophobia (x8)

Lord, be havin' mercy on my soul
I'm havin' the impression that my life gonna be a bowl of cherries
But it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't' got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while ya'll made up yo beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I lay my head
Born in 1975
Never thought I'd make it this far
Still battlin' in this racial war
Tryin' to find solutions to the situation I'm facin'
Only thing that's free is my flow that yall be chasin'
Lettin' my niggas know before I go
I drop that knowledge like dropping books
Let's stop the crooks from robbing of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good
You enter my hood you won't be findin' much
Hope that when I'm gone ya'll remember this
What we stood for, fuck that fame and that glitz
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
Got to be more careful, know what corners you be bendin'
Revelations getting impatient
Now I'm dead
Remember what I said
I'm gone
Bow ya heads

I pray there's a god at the end of all this
Life is short, take more baths
Children of the cornbread
I've never been to afrika
Sorry I forgot to call you back
Obviously oblivious
How good a friend are you
Big girls are beautiful to me
Fruit snack addict
Umm, you still on yo' pyramid?
Across cultures, darker people suffer most. why?
Ok, hand over the cure and stop playing
Art or fart?
I've never had f@ckbook, twitt@r, or inst@gram
Everything is temporary
Ninjas kill me

Sloppy wet Poseidon
God. or god?

A boy
To raise
At a
Young age
No help
From him
But she's alive
To be
Made strong
But all
Alone
Must be
A pain
But she's alive

The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was going down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now

A boy
To raise
At a
Young age
No help
From him
But she's alive
To be
Made strong
But all
Alone
Must be
A pain
But she's alive

I was scufflin' going to school
I was scufflin' working at night
And you know what
I truly believe
And that's why I tell a lot of parents
Single parents, don't tell me what God can't do
I made sure you had
I never felt like you should be deprived of anything
If a man didn't want to take care of his child
You move on
And that's what I did
I moved on

A boy
To raise
At a
Young age
No help
From him
But she's alive
To be
Made strong
But all
Alone
Must be
A pain
But she's alive
A boy
To raise
At... at a
Young age
No help
From him
But she's alive

He always wanted to be a father
But he never took care of you
He ain't have no money
He ain't have nothin'
How can you care about somebody
And you never give the welfare of them

A boy
To raise
At a
Young age
No help
From him
But she's alive
To be
Made strong
But all
Alone
Must be
A drag
But she's alive
A boy
To raise
At a
Young age...
No help
From him
But she's alive
To be
Made strong
But all
Alone
Must...

And I knew I had to go that road by myself

She's alive

Kept my dick wet with that same old bed
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry - get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to a anew
So far removed from all we've been through
Oh-oh-oh, and you and you and you
You tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black
We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I'd go back to her
And you go back to...
You go back to...

I, I love you much - it's not enough
I love blowing you lovepuff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...
I go back to black
Everybody do the crayon, crayon x4

Black or blue, purple or yellow
Or red
See, we all in this box together
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
The world is like a coloring book
To get the whole picture each other it took
So
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Get sleazy
We started out so cute in our baby pictures
That mommy shot for our daddy so that he wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day hell remember
If not hes human, Im human, you human, well forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him
Hes such a cool a-s guy, then wonder why she date him
Im only 8, Im not old enough, guess its complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it dont get negated
I was gon save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but its the 19802s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin Irish Baileys
She say Stacks, youre true blue?
I said Nah, Im Navy
I call her Kesha, she like it, because its hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 cause Im good to her
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
You can't imagine the immensity of the f*ck Im not giving
About your money and man servant at the mansion you live in
And I dont wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just grab a bottle, some boys, and lets take it back to my basement
And get sleazy, sick of all your lines, so cheesy
Sorry daddy, but Im not that easy
Im not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it
Imma take it back to where my man and my girls is
Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, cause imma get
Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, cause imma get
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds

The beats so fat gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
I dont mean to critique on your seduction technique
But your moneys not impressing me, its kinda weak
That you really think youre gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off, by showing me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends, we dont buy bottles, we bring em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave em
And I dont care if you stare and you call us scummy
Cause we ain't after your affection, and sure as hell not your money, honey
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
