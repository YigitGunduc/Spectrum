Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

I cut my hair and bump my head and fell on top
And run on sins, and front on friends
If we don't win then pay your Tithes and mend your fence
And we alright, the Kaio Ken and big old rims
And LA hoes, if that ain't wrong, if I ain't gone
I ain't home, I ain't them, I ain't them
No more ends and no more trends
And photo tint and photo lens, notice this
Pour this shit, bonafide, woe is me
Bowl of grits, naked pimp, beamin' up, clean as fuck
Other side chill for niggas, makin' life look clear for niggas
Hill for niggas, tip top cliff for niggas, this the vision side to side
So give the nigga, if we honest you gon' miss a nigga
Twisted with 'em, this the isms
See your bitch might kiss a nigga, which nigga? Get specific
Big ass pot, wrist is glistened, your list is shit
And your, if it isn't, this cost some titties and scar your face
The wrong of wrongs has caught a case
Other niggas they Mobb like Carter say from far away
All my niggas like "Calm down"
Lovin' life above a reason, just can't find it like a dozen people
Catch that vibe at night, and Bobby Whitney
Get too tired to write and died in prison
Felt like Rob tonight, lost my god tonight?

Oh sometimes I get so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now

How many souls do you touch a day?
How many hoes do you fuck a day?
How many flows do your thought convey?
How many know you can't walk away?
Depending on the way I feel, I might kill everybody around me
Might heal everybody around me, how the wind blow
Open your window, let the debris in, never let me in
I kick back with kick though
Maybe if I could live hundred years that be real?
Pay me if I'mma be rhymin' these homonyms
Crazy, my other show went to my mom 'n' 'em
My daddy said a Mercedes had haunted him
But now he got one, I'm ridin' shotgun
With a three-piece chicken dinner and shot gun
I bring your weekend to an ending and pop one
I'm in the deep end, boss nigga you not one
And I believe in Kool-Aid and God's son
Do you believe that Black man is our sun?
I made enough residuals to hide some
I gave enough, my niggas know I divide some
I told Zay, I'm the best rapper since twenty five
Been like that for a while now, I'm twenty-nine
Any nigga that disagree is a fuckin' liar
Pardon me, see my alter ego was Gemini
Him and I been around ever since Reagan was criticized
Might stay in the Trump Tower for one week
Spray paint all the walls and smoke weed
Fuck them and fuck y'all and fuck me
I proceed my last check in proceeds
To all the kids, the hood, the bricks, the books
To fix the blocks we on to right my wrongs
The word, to give the life we live as I get...

...so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now

Oh you got two Xannies, oh, just don't forget me
Love me for the moment (all in the air now) hug me like a sibling
Weed ain't that important, vice cops in the kitchen
Grew with Apollonia (all in the air now) Rob was makin' chicken
Beat me down, you beat me down, reorganize my face
Now when I go home, I don't know what my fam gon' say
Zay, say it ain't love cause you bought flowers yesterday
Thoughts was always cheap, cheap, cheap
But now let's talk 'bout me, me, me
Lately I been comin', this ain't goin' how I wanted
When I pull up at your window, bitch come out, you hear that beep, beep, beep
Faithful as your EBT, closer than you momma kin
Anger when you rang about my dog but I'm gon' call again
Freak me out, keep me out, why they always leave me out
Niggas that been hatin'  just can't wait to have my CD now
Don't we look like CP and Nirvana on that keep me pound
Please be down, I been more than late...

Oh sometimes I get so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now
All in the air now

Okay, I'mma tell you this story, man...A few years ago, I gave my pops, uh, Cilvia, Cilvia Demo and my pops said, uh...he listened to it for about a week, came back to me, said, uh...said, "Dang, boy, why...Zay talkin' 'bout he gon' run up in somebody house? He...he...he talkin' 'bout you?"
Now, everybody tellin' me a lie
Lordy, give me something for my soul
See, I don't wanna think of suicide
So please don't take the lock key off my door
See, I've been tired of fucking all these girls
And I've been tired of spending all my dough
And if I give my story to the world
I wonder if they'd book me for a show
See you can't handle pressure on your own
So why you carry boulder by yourself?
The story’s storyteller tell it wrong
And glorify the horror and the wealth
And Mama call me, tell me coming home
And I just need some guidance in my steps
I know I'm not the only one alone
I know I'm not the only one who felt

Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?

Look now, I'm praying that I make it twenty-five
They be calling doctors for my health
And "no" is kinda hard to say to drugs
I been having problems with myself
And I been asking questions, where the love?
And they don't give me answers, just a check
And they don't know my issues as a child
Cause I was busy cutting on myself
And hanging from the playground wasn't wrong
Until you got a rope around your neck
And I been losing more than just my mind
Gathering what's left of self-respect
And Daddy, why you call me while you're drunk?
And why you never love me when I need it?
And I don't wanna be like you no more
And I been trying to cope, I'm getting weeded

Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?

Look hey I smoke too much:
The problems of a twenty-something
I drink too often, there's liquor pouring from the faucet
You would assume by following the tunes
That I'm doomed to die young, addicted to dry plum
These bitches ain't shit
And pussy is my greatest vice
I love smoking weed, I hate advice
I know some niggas that talk good
The wise men from a long line of bitch-made and brides-men
You never had nothing but fucking dreams
You just caught up in the hype
The fashion and so it seems, the limelight
I know that I rhyme tight
No need for your two cents and burning your blueprints
These people think I really give a fuck about the shit they give a fuck about
Just need a moment of silence, just close your fuckin' mouth
Infatuated with violence, gun in my fuckin' mouth
So you don't even know that I'm serious
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Like you got punchlines for days
So generic your flow
You're too cold, you're aged
And you got punch lines for days
So generic your flow
You're too cold, you're aged
Yeah, and I'm so misrepresented by niggas that claim trill
And they souls was never in it, like
And I'm so misrepresented by niggas that claim trill
They souls was never in it, like...
Beat tight as fuck. Turn up! Turn the light off, Des, turn it down. Aye, you roll up? You’ll roll up for the boys? For the Squad? Nah, that’s Ty job right now. Aye, check me out

If I can pay my bills, I'm good, I'm comin' over
Found a message in my bottle your son is comin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – what Yari saying?
You ain’t nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up
Listen here I say my dude and what you call it
It was heaven at the bottom and peace from throwin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up

I think I do this shit for real dawg
Hey, I ain't no motherfuckin' maybe
I'm for motherfuckin' real dawg
Hey mama, mama
I got some dollars for your bills, though (Bills though)
Hey, now I'm the hit and I'm the topic
All that matters I'm Jaleel dog,  hey
You know I think the sunshine
Should feel how I feel, how I feel like yeah
I think at night time, the moon should call my phone
Hit my line, I'm here for you
And Eastside shame on us
Rain come on now
I figured the mood
I figure, I figure

When I pay my bills I'm good, I'm comin' over
Found a message in my bottle your son is comin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – what Yari saying?
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up
Listen here I say my dude and what you call it
It was heaven at the bottom and peace from throwin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up

I got a dollar and a stop in Kansas
Toto to do or do not, do not forget me
I been wylin' Santa, pop and rock 'em
Lord forgive 'em for the talcum powder
Alright now stretch it, bless it
Bless it my brother and his record
On the record, for the record
Hey, and play it back 'cause they respect us
Alright now I got the moon and the stars below my feet
So low I speak
So I don't wake them, praise the Lord, the God in me
Who made me spoiled with rotten teeth
So I perform the prophecy
And on the norm the plot could be
To be expressing who we are and addressin' who they aren't
And doin' what they can't...and want

If I can pay my bills, I'm good, I'm comin' over
Found a message in my bottle your son is comin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – what Yari saying?
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up
Listen here I say my dude and what you call it
It was heaven at the bottom and peace from throwin' up
By the beer, by ear, by boo – my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growin' up

Hey, hey, hey, hey
I take a drag at the square, I feel anxious, spit dangerous
As the verbal appears, is reflecting my perspective
Beer goggle and fear, roll model so hollow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them bitches
Road to the riches still paved with the ditches
Get caught up in the hype, your career is for a night
I ain't these other niggas, cause these niggas is fake
They ain't popping shot, these niggas is Papa Doc
If I ain't meant to shine, beat me up in a rhyme spot
No crying 'til I'm in pine box
I got the bitches hitting Mikey like where Zay at?
Probably fucking on her friend, probably L.A. at
Probably plotting on a mil staying where Fay at
Bitch don't run your mouth we don't play that
Mama taught me better, can't count on niggas
Can't count on weather, go figure nigga
They ain't worried about this cheddar
Them niggas just sky diving in my propellers, I don't feel 'em
Ain't trying to be no freshman, I'm chilling
Cause they'll bring a knife to the fight, and not kill 'em
Me and my niggas is hungry, we're willing
To bring a little ho to the party and Meek Mill 'em
I feel like talking my shit
Come in the house, acting friendly, you can suck my dick

I'm praying for some good rappers and a fleetwood
Why I gotta bring my A game? You just D goods
We don't wanna hear that weak shit, nigga speak up
Rocking old flows corn rows and a beeper
You niggas hoes, you niggas hoes and I ain't even tripping
Cause we'll be laughing to the bank and riding by these niggas
Mikey bring that mink with your low body Bentley
Put the hood in the fucking trunk and bring the party with me

I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do now?
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
I bang, I bang, I blocka, what you do now?
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, what you do now?

Everything takes time
Is you selling or you buying nigga? Get rich or die trying
Yay yay on the stove, I had the choppers in the Cutlass
Just a young nigga tryna get some hundreds
I had a little bucket, yeah, I rode it like a benz
Yeah I spent my little ends on that Butlass
Tell me who you trust
Look I got my faith in God cause these clown ass niggas all bustas
These niggas not Jesus, they ain't gonna die for you
And only time will tell what's gon' lie for you
It's funny right what a couple lies will do
But seeing is believing what defines the truth
I keep shooters on the wing when I'm riding through
And if niggas out of bounds they gon probably shoot
Cause killing is the hobby
Eastside niggas, yeah, we known for catching bodies
I used to have a deuce five riding on the trolly
On my way to school like dare nigga try me
Look, cause where I'm from I'm a blood on an island
Surrounded by blue water, sharks all around me
Pigs on my ass, hoes tryna drown me
Niggas know I'm up so these haters wanna down me
Niggas know I'm king but they don't wanna crown me
It's okay, I ain't 'bout to whine about it
Look, a real nigga for real nigga, now check it
I'm still here I'm still counting my blessings
With no chains on, with no rings on
Watching these fake rappers, getting my aim on
Pop a shot, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
And watch 'em fall like confetti, fuck 'em all (fuck 'em all)
It's just me and my niggas taking over the game
And since I conquered this craft, nothing will be the same

Not a dollar on me, this home invasion a payday
Two time felon they jerking me on my pay rate
Slaving all these hours but couldn't shake that my rent late
Making eight an hour I'm leaning towards my AK
Moms thinks I'm vicious, don't want me round the kitchen
My living room, bathroom, my bedroom was evicted
Missing from your homeroom my good grades was cripping
Before I even learned division, nigga I learnt the mission
See I'm from where fiends scratch that itch, won't hit the lotto
And I'm from where fiends fix that fix and not a  bottle
And that little nigga that missed that bottle gon' catch a hollow
Or maybe even throw him pyro, pyro
See this set don't make too many niggas rich that I know
You either gang bang, sell dope or bet on the four
See money on the ground, my eyes glued to the floor
I double deuce by my toe, see Figg get it and go
I feel stuck in my ways, a nigga just tryna get paid
I'm tired of answering questions why Oxymoron delayed
See I was thinking November, but January is sweet
It set my setbacks free, my habits won in my sleep
So January agree, get a taste of this gangsta
See I'm just tryna eat, with a freak of the week
I'm just tryna hit 'em and leave 'em, dog, they yours for the keep
But don't be kissing them broads, my sperm on their teeth
Last night was nothing, this morning I'm a hero
No belief in me, dawg, they said I'd mount to zero
Cocaine, cocaine, rock, rock kilo
Fishscale, cut well, you won't find Nemo
Pull up to the block and they call me real nigga
See I can be a real nigga, but my daughter see me bigger
See a body full of love and yours full of liquor
But you'll always be my nigga, said you'll always be my nigga

I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do now?
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
I bang, I bang, I blocka, what you do now?
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, what you do now?

I come from where you can't suck my dick and leave my cousin out

Don't nut on her face
Trust me I feel like the man
Trust me I feel like the Wop, rock
You can depend on the stock, watch

Rich as a bitch in the drop
Rich as a bitch, rich as my bitch on the side
Hoe I got more than you know, ho I got...
Look, watch, spill out your soul in the closet
Don't question your passion
We flipped that reefer 'cause we couldn't be ashing
They got me so high that I look like I'm passing
Bitch, don't you know who you asking?
Bitch, have you tutored the pastor?
I know the root and the master
I know the coupe was a casket
I had that bitch looking like all the shit that I’m writing
That shit was so good that I passed it
Bust that shit straight out the plastic
Bitch, I ain’t good, bitch, I’m crafty
I wanna piss on a rapper
I just got hookers and pampers
Niggas line up when I practice
I’m not a savage, I don’t do shit just to do it

Now can we fall in love while Southernplayalistic banging through the night?
Fall in love, through the night
And I ain't ever felt no type of way about this living, do or die
Type of way, do or die
And when they see our age, they say we're young
I'll let you push me to the side
Push me to the side
At least we fell in love with something greater than debating suicide
At least we fell in love

How you feeling, baby?
How you feeling, baby?

I travel, for you
I battle, for you
'Cause I love, to call, your name
I travel, for you

I've been ridin' out, since I thought my Huffy was the shit
Chattanooga pool of sharks, don't you slip and lose a limb
Slow it down, we losin' 'em, I've been on the booze again
Shit, that sober livin' Hell, free Guwop if he in jail
Nigga taught me 'bout the scale, it was vivid, I was there

Fresh and clean, that Stankonia had me hooked as a child
Used to think my ambition was a scheme, I defy 'em
You can too, if you get up off your ass, fucking try it
I'm a slave, I'm just tryna make the top fall off
On the whip, like a cannon, lollipop on y'all
Xanny ho get me high, make me feel so tall

So don't call me a nigga, unless you call me "my nigga"
I'm a king, O.E. be slipping, falling from my chalice
Don't mind the bumpers that was missing from my carriage
It's poorly tinted, but my women not embarrassed
I came to bury you average, you feel slighted
It's like she know that I got it, it feel like it
I real life it, I spill vices
You will like it, I promise it's trill vomit, I'm honest
Nigga ain't no getting money on that conscious shit
I'mma just load my gat on some survival shit
And when I hear they got a drought on it
I take a month out of rap and I hustle 'til I'm out of it
I got that coke flow, that heat rock
I got that old school, huddle 'til the beat box
Baby, I'm just digging in your gushy for the sweet spot
I'mma beat that, 'til that mothafuckin' beat drop

I got love for my niggas, my killers
My dealers, my trickers, my bros
I got love for my sisters, my women
My bitches, my strippers, my hoes
I got love for my niggas, my killers
My dealers, my trickers, my bros
I got love for my sisters, my women
My bitches, my strippers, my hoes
I got love for my nigga

Hope they don't kill you cause you black today
They only feel you when you pass away
The eulogy be so moving, we live the scenes of those movies
Conflict in school or dope moving, it's so youthful
But if you die today, I hope you findin' some relief
In what a great escape, we still dodging from polices
When we make a plate, they lying, searching in my bucket
With the straightest face, it could be eighty eight
Sometimes I wonder why we killers, why they killing us
I think we only wear a grill because they grilling us
Or how they feeling us, gotta look real and tough
Gotta keep your hands in the cart, know you stealing stuff
Came a long way from a boat and an auction
Now we got names and a vote, then a coffin
Ain't shit change but the coast we adopted
Little black children you can call me that nigga, nigga

I got love for my niggas, my killers
My dealers, my trickers, my bros
I got love for my sisters, my women
My bitches, my strippers, my hoes
I got love for my niggas, my killers
My dealers, my trickers, my bros

Man, I'm just writing shit don't get mad when we're tryna rap
Listen me in this motherfucker..
Yeah

I'm just one dirty motherfucker, hurt myself way more than you
This too much out here for the cup, I put that codeine in my soup
Used to spit in granny face, I'm supposed to show you love
I don't need no picket line and I don't need no fuckin' hug
You just rappin' just because, with your napkin full of drugs
Too exclusive in the back, should we sneak 'em in the club?
Who is that nigga if I ain't that nigga?
It ain't that poppin' if I ain't with Robert
Gotta consider my liver, my nigga
Gotta get rid of my kidney, my nigga
That was the only thing holding me back
None of these niggas ain't tellin' me shit
Lately I only been bumpin' that Yachty
All this Burberry on top of my body
I knew Lil Sunny would get me that 'Rari
Pullin' up tryna tell me the truth
I hit you back like, lil nigga, revise it
Look what I got, bitch, it's Tity and Dolla
Tell 'em lay back and just check out the power

Sweet line I used to walk, we used to want

Condoms, weed, and lotion, wavy like the ocean
I got no emotions, dolo in the function
You ain't in my section, you can't tell me nothin'
She just wanna sip on the real pink soda
Ride with a big billed .40
Slide through the hood, I know it's all good
I ain't from the set but I still got soldiers
Seven when I roll the dice, Henny straight, hold the ice
Lately I don't take advice, claimin' we don't live for twice
Send you to a poltergeist, treat the beat like I planned a heist

I know bitches just wanna be hoes
No hoe just wanna love me
Know she wanna get cuddly, sip the bubbly
With an OG smokin' OG
I know bitches just wanna be hoes

Sheesh, fine lines I cross between
Pimp shit and try to enjoy this life
Yeah bitch I know what it's like
You get whatever you wish long as your coin is right, right
Wake up to the real tamale
So ill might kill somebody just for GP
Be me with a white bitch
Waitin' around the corner in a Mustang GT
I ain't talkin' bout much
Nothin' but fuckin' and countin' a few bucks
I'm all that shit you talk
My crystal ball show your future when I cruise up, now listen
All I want is gravy for my steak, bitch
I'm gon' grind for this weight

I ride around in your car
I put my weed in your blunt
I am the sky to your star
I am the end of your month
You are the start of my day
You brought the smile from my face
I see the world from your eyes
You pulled a thorn from my side

I know you love me
It's rare, I know you love me
But, yeah, I know you love me
It's rare, I know you love me

You give me all that you got
You make it stretch it and flip
I fell in love with your thoughts
I learned it's more than your hips
You know I'm caught in my vibe
But I still give you my rib
You hear them callin' my name
But know it's hard for me here
I'm left at home with my son
I chose the world in the end
I say you know I be back
You try your best to pretend
I say you all that I want
And when I make it, it's real
I hear 'em callin' my name
It's gettin' hard for me here

To know you love me
It's rare to know you love me
But yeah I know you love me
It's rare I know you love me

And these stars are nothin' but your cousins
And starin' at your mama, Heaven wasn't falling in here
So holla you heard I'm usin' narcotics
I don't wanna be here if I don't gotta
My weed habit so close to snortin' powder
Got a few gripes but it's only about a dollar bill so holla
Unless you're usin' narcotics
See I don't wanna be here if I don't gotta
My weed habit so close to snortin' powder
Got a few bitches but it's only bout a dollar
Feel so hollow unless you're usin' narcotics
See I don't wanna

Tell me, man you talkin' bout this, you talkin' bout that. Talkin' about shit you ain't got nothin' to talk about, find a motherfuckin' topic, God damn just find the topic bro. Seriously God damn, complicated ass young motherfuckers
Modest, I, be in interviews, so niggas hating
Cause I play it like, I no have no clue that I'm the greatest
Tori come, sit up on this dick, I see you waiting
Need a baby cause I'm too young and wild to be the savior
Nail me to the cross and I'm just hanging
Least they left the serpent in my fingers, I'm just smoking
Players from my city rarely make it to a poster
'less you got a warrant, what you got in that Corolla? (Hey)
Oh, officer, just Boosie Boo and DG Yola, listen
Won't let them haters get me down, that's what they told us
It's funny how they blame the south when they weak shit don't blow up
We came with all the funk while niggas act like they don't know us
Just living a lie, OG's, acting like hoes, we couldn't rekindle the fire
Nigga, retire, nigga, catch up with the time, I can see more than the block
I can see more than your spot, I don't be stuck in the past, homie, I'm puffing
The grass, holding my cup like a strap, look at my southerner ass

Niggas try to tell you what you want
But niggas rarely give you what you need
Ay, bitch, I came right here with the bounce
And if that ain't enough I got some weed

Ay, bitch, I came right here with the bounce

With my Nia Long, I sing her a song, she masturbating
Then bring me along, she got something to say like Larry David
But I leave her lone, ho, I gotta go, I got a baby
Stuck in Babylon, niggas carry bombs and carry rabies
Who gon' speak for you? Who gon' sing your song if you don't play this?
I got stress for days, picture you go home and you that nigga
But can't pay your bill, you can't buy no diapers for your little one
Don't you pay for thrill, child support is like a check away
How you chill with Kendrick? Do you smoke with Q and Dr. Dre?
Least today is real, I should ask some groupie for some face
Just a stepping stone, least them kind of bitches know their place
This my second home, this where favorite rappers get replaced
This what the niggas from the South gon' kill that, doubt it, bring the bass
Bitch, I came here right here with an ounce
And if that ain't enough you gotta leave

Niggas try to tell you what you want
But niggas rarely give you what you need
Ay, bitch, I came right here with the bounce
And if that ain't enough I got some weed

You want to talk her to death but I'm House-ing that bitch
Bleed her to death
Feed all my niggas then leave her to death
I've been so good with this shit, do you live here to die?
All them niggas bereaving your steps, uh, uh
Mama I just wanna shine
Pussy ass nigga gon' lean on the ref
Nigga I woke up this mornin'
Feeling like I don't be needing myself
I'ma get bigger than Whoo Kid
Who can go harder than Mac?
Put the lil Xan in my back
I'ma go harder though, I'ma go harder though
Look at the martyr go, smokin' the artichoke
This what you wanted, ain't this what you wanted
They dissing "Tha Carter IV"
I'ma flip me a bitch in the mornin' though
I'ma flip me a bitch in the mornin' though
I'ma flip me a bitch and my partners talk shit
While my niggas say, "This why we in here, ain't this why we did it?"

My nigga just made it back home, pocket full of money, god damn
Them niggas might smile when they see him
Nigga made it back home, pocket full of money, god damn
Them niggas might smile when they see him

I can't help but, kick my feet up
Call my kinfolk, dawg
What you doing? Where we going? To the hills
I can't help but, I can't, I can't
I can't help but, kick my feet up
Call my kinfolk, dawg
What you doing? Where we going? To the hills
To no worries, bring the liquor

Yeah, I know a bald head bitch and she ain't worth shit
Tryna serve me papers and suck my dick
Tryna take my son, bitch you ain't worth rocks
Let me ease my mind, let me kill my lungs
I don't know your name, I forgot that shit
I'm for real, four times, yeah
I won't lose my grip, 'fore I turn Cobain
It look good next year, yeah
When I listen to the deacon say it, I'm pullin' over
I've been prayin' with a reefer head, yeah
In the valley, meditatin'
Where you going? Can you take me?

My nigga just made it back home, pocket full of money, god damn
Them niggas might smile when they see him
Nigga made it back home, pocket full of money, god damn
Them niggas might smile when they see him

I can't help but, kick my feet up

What you doing? Where we going? To the hills
I can't help but, I can't, I can't
I can't help but, kick my feet up
Call my kinfolk, dawg
What you doing? Where we going? To the hills
To no worries, bring the liquor
She so fuckable, and she got the menthol
And Tunji brought the trees that turned my trousers into cement drawls
Sleeping on couches, only vouchers is my in-laws
He sold ten ounces, one verse is like an eight ball
Look, I seen it crystal clear, I seen a pistol near
Seen it cock back and knock caps like it's senior year
These niggas think I give a fuck, I could drink a beer
Read a magazine, hut, hut, pass interference
I've been riding clean in my bucket for a couple years
I've been pre-stressed Lawrence Pucket, mothafucka, yeah
Baby hold my hand while I stumble up these fucking stairs
Know your nigga here, you still suckin', why you fucking scared?
And hoes love it when I'm high off life, cause she know
I'm getting faded, I could fuck all night
Y'all too busy popping Mollys, you could die off hype
My favorite rapper popping ollies and he rap all dyke, I know it

I had a couple drinks, and I wonder
If I could call you, tomorrow and borrow, your heart
See I've been stressing for a blessing
The one that would set me apart, set me apart
I got all my problems, but I no have no weed
When they say money solve 'em, I say "No, not me"
And I don't love no more, but I'll just let you be
Cause you see all my problems and you still had loved me

You cut your hair about as short as your temper, the prescription
For dementia, start slipping an elixirs make it hard to remember
As I recall it with your heart in a blender, drinks spiking
Still chilling, put your life on ice and sink like me
Actions of us, lacking the passion, but think
Righteous from pussy upon a tongue, to calling to hear my son
Thought the remedy was balling, I'm falling darling I'm done
Finna to be a workaholic, an alcoholic or somethin', I'm just calling baby
I left my daddy round '97, he was lazy
Couldn't hit the grind but making babies, I'm crazy
Smoking bouquet, cop it from my niggas pushing daisies
Like a romance, push a nigga buttons like a program
I been on the Jäger for a day-ger watch me slow dance
Tough as Conan this the art of barbarian
I got four white girls, all Aryan
I wonder what their daddy think fuck 'em, it's a revolution
Fuck it, fuck 'em, take a break, let 'em fuck each other
I ain't your everyday normal brother, porno lover
She savin' children by the low and guzzle, what is muscle?
And I'm finessing like I'm Timmy Duncan, win you something
Immaculate, this scatter rapping, no passing my blunt
Don't you put me on freshman covers, I'm posing with lunch
Think they worthy of presence presently passing 'em up
No competing with bleachers jogging I'm running a muck
Sweet Jesus, I fuck around and need a street sweeper
Leave the bodies on the cul-de-sac, follow me the cult is back
Sippin' on that cognac and that Jim Jones
Watching movies like, "Damn, that Vince Vaughn is a funny cat"
Fred Claus and the Kelly up in your closet
Belly full of smog again, ciggys just make me nauseous
Wonder how the fuck you let a nigga make you cautious
But you jamming out to fucking Marilyn and Ozzy shit
Ponzi scheme selling everybody dreams
Killer like your neighbour, I'm as nice as everybody seems
We just breaking bad and my brother serving Walter White
Hope he ain't caught with that possession like a poltergeist
Momma, where the Priests at? Why we gotta lease that?
Why we can't own that? All these fed loaners
Ain't no forewarning came bombing and I'm just Vietnam
If you gon' be trippin' like a bitch, you should be a mom, see the son

Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie

But thank God I got my bank, where I keep my heart inside
And I keep it far away from all these hoes and flashin' lights
I'm like Granny with the whip, I'm not Oprah with these hoes
And I keep a snoopy broad because it keep me on my toes

We get better by the steps so if I ever let you go

Cause I always really wanna be that nigga in the back
You don't live it with me, I can't show you how to live
But I promise I can show a pussy nigga how to act
Junked out smokin' from the side door
With a bitch I wanted in the eighth grade
Hope you got an ass like Nori
Hope you pussy niggas never see me
This is why I never want a feature
Cause I can tell you bitches got a limit
I can be subjective 'bout you fuckin' up the highway
You fuckin' up the ride, why you fuckin' up the heist?

Like, baby, can you sucky on my dick? I know it's big enough
Ride with a nigga from the South, I know you feel the rush
Fucking with a nigga, bitches rarely ever get to touch
Better feel privileged, catch a nut or you can hit the dust
I done grown up for my child sake, black and mild face
Blick and blaow place, never crowd spaced
Never skirt chased, maybe first grade
Never last place, never had brakes
Pop a transmission, always had faith
Always had trace, always had James
In that duplex, hit a suplex, fuck a crew neck
Spottie solo up in recess
Never regress, Georgia peaches
Grab her cheek ass, such a slutbag
Baby nut rag, never cuff that
Love a hood rat, where this puss at
Brittany have me going on that Sosa, I'll never go back
I never hit her raw again, fucking with the law again
Picking up trash on highways, never my way
Blasé blasé, sneaking shotty
Fuck a Friday, I'm with Robert
Chugging bombay, fuck your turn up
Fuck your turn out, we gon burn up
Fuck your mosh pit, I'm on my shit
On that Tribe shit, got that Phife Dawg

Scribble down, I'm rapping like Kool
Inspire all my local jokers who be quitting that school
They be hating that job, I was hating that too
I was flipping your burger high as a bitch, but I'm cool

I only stress about the stress now since I'm fresh now
Pull that motherfucking dress down (dress down, dress down)

And I'm gon' test the fire, girl

You like, You like, You Like, You Like, You like, You like

Fruit loop for the young, honeycomb for some

And I was bending the corners, hot boxin' the sauna

Uhn, lil bro can you fuck with me (yeah yeah)
Came through at the last minute (yeah yeah)
Living, wasting my time
Lacing with percs, purp in a bind
Hazy, oh baby, I'm better when blind
I don't see nothin' this perfect can fine (yeah yeah)

We are the young and Xanax, oh
See, there's nowhere to go
To hide from the lows
Cause we are the young and Xanax, oh
See, there's nowhere to go
Stuck on the high, yeah

My son sleep, I'm rollin it up, I don't sleep (rollin' it)

You fuckin' with us, I won't eat (fuckin' with)
Start stomping your feet, I need that
Depending on all of your feedback
Come out to my show and come feed that
Can't go back to sellin' that retail
My daddy left me with no details
Came back with a bitch and his stepson
I guess he forgot that he left somethin'
He must have been saving the best bum (yeah yeah)
She screaming out "Give me the rest, hun" (yeah yeah)
Pearl necklace, I empty my left nut (yeah yeah)
Most niggas can't fuck with my worst shit (yeah yeah)
I'm scribing my living with curses (yeah yeah)
Just wait till I get this shit perfect (yeah yeah)
You niggas can't fuck with my verses (yeah yeah)
See, Davey don't think that I'm bout this (yeah yeah)
Don't make me come run in your houses (yeah yeah)

Your rosary shining so nicely (ooh)

Stuck on the high, yeah
10-4, 10, 10-4. Hello? We-got- We got a  4-2-3. We got a young man riding around, in a Natty Caddy, hehe
Not Natty Caddy, not that at all

Who's that creepin' through the city in that dark ass tint
Misdemeanor on the way yo
I slide in my rimless Bentley, no tights, I'm gymnast
Bending blocks, my world of Legos
Now baby, hold that wheel while I'm rollin' up
Hopefully she old enough
To purchase that liquor, what I need from the store
She understands her selection, advance her affection
And fears my rejection, never needing a ho
I got plans to be that nigga, I know you met him as a child
He gave you 10 bones, don't sweat it, don't wile'
Be cool for a minute, '93 'Til be cool for Emmett
The hung soul a rapper goes rapping those wrapping woes up
Defying foes, lying toes, weapons on tuck
Malcolm, they tackle for belief in the movement
But Rashad got applause for releasing the music

Now sometimes I be gettin' higher than a bitch
Smoking all my lows, put the fire to the spliff
What up, now what up
Now I've been getting higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
Now what up, now what up, now what up, what up

Ay, ay, ay, yeah
Niggas steppin' in the swimming pool, invincible
Women I pursue get lost in this, uh
Middle of the summer's in Miami
Kembe with me, Henney, sippin shots like I bought it for him
I'm a brown skin small waisted
I'm creeping with my ball faces, I like her titties too
I like her attitude, I like her flexible
She got a baby due, I think she bisexual
At least I hope so
I glance to that little grown man at her front door
He looking at me like I looked at pops when he come fo'
My mama as a toddler I was selfish this ain't nothin' new
I can spit a couple 22s if I want to
I save it for the tour, the allure of the gap tooth
Rap Toose in shape or somethin'
Always knew he would make him something
He got schemes to smoke green
And make him some, take em son
Well, thank God for the shooter, hmm
And thank God for the leader, hmm
And think hard for a message
Blink art on pedestrians; what are you, a believer?
We're tranquil for a Brutus, hey
And hard road for a Caesar, hey
Well, who came from the heavens?
They kill for a blessin', they gon' do it to Jesus, hm
And thank God for the shooters

Them hard streets make a militant man
Fuck a bitch, be as real as you can
Our education, they tend to say we killers again
But I'd rather give this living a chance, I'm getting patience
I wonder if the world is gon' see us as just niggas
They treat lyrics like I hold triggers like I make difference
Then downplay, what I'm given like I'm no different
It make me wanna move to my aunt's house
I've been on pills since a little one
Start with Advil then we level up
I wonder if my son gon' trust me, after songs so ugly
Bout his moms, ain't mean to see the world so crummy
They got.. Tec-9's for Jesus
So I figured that the second coming wasn't never coming
Go figure heaven is a hassle cause
They don't even want a nigga back in Africa


And some of us fall and some of us hover
And some of us shooters and some of us lovers
I see the sum of it all, I'm running for cover
Invite you for supper, but really they hunt you
What's really 300, who's really a gangster
Who's really the prey? Who's really in danger?
I'm willing to pray, I'm feeling the angels
Is liquor the savior? This moment will contain us
And ride to the far side, I'm looking for peace
Just spread the cigar wide, a moment of ease
Hard benches for my brothers that be roaming the streets
We don't always be the leaders that they want us to be
I'm just hoping that she praying while she down on her knees
See I often treat these hoes like their fathers would be
Good Lord, my flaws, blind you, got you time for, my flaws
Yo now it's just me, my nigga Mikey D, gettin' throwed
We was bangin' out some Masta P, on the road
I prefer my word with platinum teeth, maybe gold
They don't like it when you come direct, well fuck, but Spottie bold
Tell them hoes they better come correct, cause I fuck
My momma told me we no 'ceptin' any memberships, no adding losses
I won't step up in your dealership until I'm flossin'
We no flexy with the funk, add a blessing to that punk
Damn, I got a son he on the way, but that's my baby
I've been spittin' like it's crack or some, like since the 80's
I was born I think in '91, that mean I'm chosen
When I slide back through your hood, bitch, just have a frozen, bitch

Yeah, Goddamn, feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Goddamn, my man, feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Scarface somethin', like I'm Brad Jordan
Feel like I'm the fuckin', feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental
In Houston, OPM on them pussy ass niggas
Feel like I'm Brad, Jordan
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental

Now you would think I work from South Park, grindin', always makin' trouble
Grippin', on another level, mothafucka
I feel like droppin' classics, like the rucker
And rappers be too passive

It's just me, my brother Spottie, bitch, sit low
I've been drinkin' since my momma called, around 4
Niggas asking me too many questions, fuckin' throwed
Rob Da Vinci, Mike December we was losing, now we winnin'
Can I sport a couple in this? Play for bucks, that Brandon Jennings
Wear your crown and your pocket, or that shit'll come up missin'
You that nigga but the misses, eat a dick and mind ya business
This for all my Eastside niggas who be eating, do no sleeping
For their seedlin', never go to parties even if it is the weekend
And shout-out to the women who be faithful to their pimpin'
And shout-out to them haters who be all up in their feelins
And shout-out to my daddy, I'mma buy your ass a Bentley

Yeah, Goddamn, feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Goddamn, my man, feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Scarface somethin', like I'm Brad Jordan
Feel like I'm the fuckin', feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental
In Houston, OPM on them pussy ass niggas
Feel like I'm Brad, Jordan
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental

Now you would think I work from South Park, grindin', always makin' trouble
Grippin', on another level, mothafucka
I feel like droppin' classics, like the rucker
And rappers be too passive

A bunch of bustas
I'm on everybody's asses, and this the notice
And I ain't even tryin', ho, did you notice?
And this the standard, uh fuckin' bogus, uh
You fuckin' rappers, uh, it's just me and my nigga Mike D
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental
In Houston, OPM on them pussy ass niggas
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental
In Houston, OPM on them pussy ass niggas

I swear
Lemme get a peach Faygo
Bring the muthafuckin' frozen through bitch, man I told you so
Ay yo, the peach, the peach, the peach and not in the, what they call it, the cans nigga
Not that can shit, not that can shit
Not the cans, I want a bottle nigga
Get the bottle from motherfuckin' right through the Wilcox Tunnel
Bring that bottle right through there
That peach kind? That peach kind
Tell that bitch to bring me a strawberry kiwi, bring me a mothafuckin' frozen
I need, I need one of those three for one bags of Flamin' Hot Cheetos
I prefer if you bought the popcorn
The popcorn, the popcorn
And if you can't bring the popcorn, bring the mothafuckin' hot fries
And if you can't bring the hot fires, go ahead and bust that five out
And bring me some Mapco chicken bitch
Yeah, slam dunk and some Mapco
Part I: "Rope"

Let's testify, that this world has—
Uhm-hm, yeah

When I'm sober I might testify
That this world has fallen out of place
For the few that always touch the sky
I don't want spaceships, I miss my roses
And I won't call you, 'cause I'm too fake
Like nowadays, I barely might know myself
But thank God I found this rope (I love you)
Yeah (I love you, I love you)
Barely know myself
But thank God I found this rope (I love you)
(I love you, I love you)

Then my daddy call me yesterday
(My daddy called me that day)
And he cried and cried into my phone
(Oh how he cried and cried)
Bout that love, that kind that he forgot
Since he left his family all alone
I don't know why I feel all in grey
And I know my heart ain't built to bleed
But I came back and forth
To chase my tracks and roll with
I ain't supposed to know here
Some goal, a face so shy
A friend so cold, ohh
Some goal, a place so high
And friends so cold
I love you, I love you, I love you

Part 2: "rosegold"

Ay, this a padded room; this a padded room
The fancy car that keeps me goin'
Glad to have you back my nig
(I know it)
Knew you was gonna make it back to this roof
(Eyes, and they shine...like 1999, like 1999)

Alright scramble, for the ammo
Can we build? Can we chill?
Can I live with my kids?
Deuce, poof, proof
Lord I, I can't feel the joy
I, I can't fill the void
Let, let 'em fill the void
Too, too young to ignore
But really if we don't make it out the city
If we don't make it to the finish line
If I don't make it to your titties
I got the music for the vibers, I got the music for the vibers
And we don't usually talk about it
It's like you debatin' with a bible, I'm really preachin' to the choir
I brought the music for the vibers though
And in the chalice that keeps me low as your morale is
Ay you just smokin' on the cabbage
I see you fuckin' with the gravity
I been waitin' for a challenge
Besides waitin' for the balance, and the apricot
And to rap with Dot, and I laugh a lot
I got some old hoes, ha, and some new friends
And some rose gold, and some, and some rose gold

(You are the fancy car that keeps me goin')
I know you hear me talkin' to you nigga
(I know ya)
I know you can hear me nigga
(You are the fancy car that keeps me goin')
Give a fuck
(I know ya)
Niggas be floatin' around
(I got my eyes on ya)
(I got my eyes and they shine like 1999)
(I got my eyes on ya)
(I got my eyes and they shine like 1999)
(Like 1999)
Only so fuckin' long you can ignore me, my nigga, don't
Fuckin' you Rashad, fuckin' hear me, dog, don't fuckin', dog
(My nigga made sure you were living for real)
(How could you ever bring a pill pack)
Control the speed
I won't let you go, no
(My nigga made sure you were living for real)
(How could you ever bring a pill pack)

I control the speed, and I won't let you go, no, no way
You're everything I love, hoes and weed
And I could testify, 'cause, who's ashamed?
So I might testify

I got a face that only your bitch could love
Your type niggas don't mix with us
Ain't this special like just because
Backpack full of that wrist and lung
Boarding pass, pass my troubles
High as fuck, lost my wallet
Going back, back to Cali
Saw my son, miss my daughter
Real life, what does it feel like?
I got my pills on, you know I'm real numb
Gettin' ready for this motherfucker

I control the speed and I won't let you go, no away
You're everything I love, hoes and weed
And I could testify, 'cause, who's ashamed?
So I might testify

I can admit, I've been depressed, I hit a wall, ouch
I hit the bank, you hit the dab, I hit the ball, out
Praying, God, pay my cable
Splurging out, one more favor
Little boys dressed like rappers
Can that road make them daddies?
I talked to God, I got approved, I got a lifeline
If I should die, while I'm awake, I had a nice time

I control the speed and I won't let you go, no away
You're everything I love
(Everything I love, how could you ever say no?)

Dawg, I just looked at your Wikipedia bro and it's some information... you know you see some information you already know? But you look at it more cause it's right in your face again?

'Cause sometimes it be talkin' to a nigga
Yeah sometimes I be talkin' back
Sometimes I be, ha
I swear

Play me, nigga I'm faded
Nigga I feel like 25 babies
Skunk drunk, lookin' like a robber
Headed to the church or headed to the brothel
Poppin' my collar, really like Bieber
How do you tell the truth to a crowd of white people?
Made it, motivational speaker, bumpin'
Most time tellin' my teacher somethin'

Baby we was like Decatur
We was like Lithonia elevated thinker, bump it
Deacon, stuntin' was a habit
Trappin' was a hobby, shooter got a reason
Thumper, Sasha why you gotta leave me?
We was like forever life is so confusin', fuck it
Take me, take me to revival
Maybe this'll help me, maybe this'll change my mind

Oh, believe I feel great today
I might just pour my drank
'Cause sometimes it be talkin' to a nigga
Yeah sometimes I be talkin' back
Sometimes I be, uh, uh, yeah

House-side niggas always stuffin' a few
Southside niggas always keepin' it there
.45 trigger gave 'em somethin' to do
We shoulda shot at the moon
House-side niggas always stuffin' a few
Southside niggas always keepin' it there
.45 trigger gave 'em somethin' to do
We shoulda shot at the moon

Jesus always told me I was special
Prove it to me go and get some money
Spread shit to the world
'Cause ain't no fun if the homies can't have some
Have mine, nigga heaven ain't free
We was just prayin' for another drink
Bitch look good to a buzzard, hey
I could barely hear from the thunder, wait
I could barely feel for the money, wait

Baby we was like Decatur
We was like Lithonia elevated thinker, bump it
Deacon, stuntin'  was a habit
Trappin' was a hobby, shooter got a reason
Thumper, Sasha why you gotta leave me?
We was like forever life is so confusin', fuck it
Take me, take me to revival
Maybe this'll help me, maybe this'll ease my mind

Oh, believe I feel great today

We shoulda shot at the moon

Ridin' down the street with the hazard lights on
Turn my phone off while I'm switchin' time zones
Lost in the sauce not sure where I stand
You can't call me back if you can't pay me in advance
Ridin' down the street with the hazard lights on
Turn my phone off while I'm switchin' time zones
Lost in the sauce not sure where I stand
You can't call me back if you can't pay me in advance
I ain't eatin' in the morn' I be sippin' on the Henny, Henny
You been lookin' for the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one
Ain't thinkin' bout your love I be shittin' on your feelings, feelings
And you be lovin' on the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one

My daddy taught me how to drink my pain away
My daddy taught me how to leave somebody
My daddy taught me how to smoke my load and go
My daddy taught me you don't need nobody
So one time for the caged bird
And one time for the real niggas
And slow dance on the Jäger
And one time for the little niggas

I ain't eatin' in the morn' I be sippin' on the Henny, Henny
You been lookin' for the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one
Ain't thinkin' bout your love I be shittin' on your feelings, feelings
And you be lovin' on the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one
You can have all my shine, I give you my light
Loving this here is wrong but it feel nice
Ice cold in my veins, ice cold in my veins, ice cold
You feel good, you take away from my pain
Can't remember my name, my address, I'm on the plane
50 thousand altitudes high up well atleast off in my brain
You was there for me on my lows and all of my gains, I give you this ring
If I could, but I know dirt won't let me do it, insecure, I need my noise
Been too good, we share our laughs, gotta move on, that's in the past
This new feeling I hope it last, kinda like forever like Keith Sweat
Gave it to Heaven, I need my pass, gones by the flame, give me all
That you have, don't hold back, I can't crash, try to hold on keep falling off
Right back at it this ain't golf, can't just swing and get back on
We just somehow lost...

I think I'm lost, why don't you give me my light
I think I'm lost, I need that light

See I'm addicted to light-skinned women with nice friends
I only want to fuck, ain't trying to be with 'em
I know I couldn't change if I wanted
You staring at a leather asking, "Why it ain't denim?"
And sometime a nigga get fucked up
And sometime these bitches get fucked too
See I was raised round the clan for the misfits
And baby momma screaming out "Fuck you
Fuck you, Zay, you only like yourself
And that bald headed bitch that you been with
You only call when it's at your convenience
You either that or trying in between it"
I laugh at it then I take another sip
I bet I just look like my daddy now
Been up two days on the Addy now
With the guns out screaming "Put the Xanny down"
We all codeining, pro leaning
But I really am tryna get the chemistry right
Cause if I mix this pill when I add this drink
Rashad'll be the nigga that'll kill me tonight
So how we feeling alright, stop killing the lights
Tryna numb this pain I've been living to fight
If we drop a few songs, we'll be living the life
And a drug dealer finna make a killing tonight, so how we feeling alright
Bitch you know you can't parallel park anyway

We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright

Back when my brother sold crack, and my sister was a real one
Always was a real one
Saw you workin' early, tell me how you feel, hon?
Baby what's your hurry, get it how you live, hon?
Baby what's your name? I've been goin' through a lot
I can't do this on my own, got no place to go Rashad
And that's a long one, hey they gon' love you when you're hot
They won't miss you when you gone, if you're looking for a spot

That's the wrong one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright

Back when my sister sold hair, heard you lookin' for the deal, hon
Get it how you live, hon
Damn you caught me splurgin', lookin' for the real ones
If I make it early, get it for the little ones
I can see your pain, hope my voice is helping out
Hope your momma workin' out, she won't even come out the house
Heard she had a surgery, granny died before the drop
I don't like to visit home, I don't like to see the drought
Call me when you steppin' out, I might bring the cup with me
I might play the "Back and Forth", on my '94 Aali
We can split a O or three, this is how it's supposed to be
Like we had a better trial, fuck the jury, fuck with me

We on our own huh, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one, cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Hey

I can make a dope fiend of you yet if I could find ya
I just like a freak ho for the nostalgia
No my heart can't break no more
I can't even feel the paper cuts
Let me see my son and let me ball, let me ball yeah
Measure twice, cut once, fucked up
On that other night and the kids got me high enough
To touch the rim
As a kid that's the only thing I wanted then
Yeah I feel like Mikey D
Lord I guess I gotta take my words back
Merge with me Henny light hurt
I got 25 plus a few
This might be the zip
Or the shit or another clue

Tell me on your knees, say it right, fix your upper lip
You just head boppin' cause I said bop it
You like jean Robins with them bean poppers
And them lean stockers
That don't mean shit
But they cool when you need somethin'
Always need somethin'
More fees, more of these suckers
I'm a tree hugger
Quarter p 'fore I eat somethin'
Keep your fees covered, play it safe
Fuck with me puppet

My momma see my page, said baby you a winner
Now at this tender age, Lord knows that I'm finna
I'm dealing with this rage, and abortions got me pent up
We could all die tonight, Lord knows that I'm

Look, Lord forgive me for all my bad decisions
My pot of gold was never hidden underground, it was packed in a bowl
With a woman by my side, couple snacks from the store
Perfecting every line, shit was left from the floor
My momma tell me "Get a job," but employment ain't employing us
Not with my record, right stage exit
Momma, I'm a king, but they pay me peasant
He tell me that I'm fired and he say it so pleasant
The hood under fire, local news not present
They focused on Trayvon, and they focused on the President
I guess it's unimportant in my residence
See they never say they love you in the present tense
I think I'm quitting school, I'mma be in debt
And work fast food, shit I'm sorry I ain't made it yet

My momma see my page, said baby you a winner
Now at this tender age, Lord knows that I'm finna
I'm dealing with this rage, and abortions got me pent up
We could all die tonight, Lord knows that I'm

I try to, I try to talk 'bout my problems, but that shit don't ever...
Don't never fucking come out right... don't never fucking...
Don't never fucking come out right when I try to

Ay, what's suicide from the top of the swing set?
Maybe I could fly but I ain't got my wings yet
They tell me, "Get a job, nigga grow up, the bills still piled
They don't care if you don't blow up, you dropping out of college, huh
You unemployed so I know you spitting polished, huh
You the first born, how you still your momma problem child?
Britney was a bitch, she always said that you was selfish
So go and buy your bitch, that's how you do it when you wealthy"
Oh, chlamydia, I thought you said that you was healthy
I'm tryna make it big, God, they said that you would help me
Say it so selfless yet pray it so selfish
I'm scared to go to Hell, smoke it to the peace
Piece landed me in jail, movies with a bitch
Bitch pregnant as hell, I was happier in jail

Devil on my shoulders, tell me no, I shouldn't get it
I probably made a baby off in that Honda Civic
After I dropped my baby off in that Honda Civic
I probably should repeat it, I know you didn't get it
I just want your bitch, I don't
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I just want your bitch I don't want no fuckin' problem
Look at what I got, he might motherfuckin' bargain, yeah
Nigga try finesse me with the hard one
How the hell you rob the fuckin' robber?
Project Pat was always like a father figure
Skinny Pimp respect me bitch I'm mobbin' nigga
Only reason anything was tinted when it's rented
Probably cause my dirty niggas with me
Ain't really down with that chainin' a bitch
Hangin' just to smoke, boy you lame as a bitch
Audi in the back and a Porsche in the front
I got some titties on my face, got 'em crawl in the mud
Since a youngin' I've been addicted to them hoes
But I never been the type to give 'em gold

Album Cover:
And I will never grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
I swear that I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
From fucking with Bree, to rolling on E
But it inspired all these verses that's flowing from me
I got Aquemini up in my tape deck
The art of storytelling, so compelling when you face it
This liberation, Antwan Patton taught me the basics
This forty, oldy, dopey, oh, suppose you'll never make it
From your comfort zone, you so scary fucking complacent
Man these niggas losers, and they see this dark ass tint and wanna pull us
Over so they can search us, camera, yes sir, I purchased
I live right up the street, I'm black, i.e. I'm worthless
I was slinging my penis, I'm just learning the meaning
Of keep it safe with a rubber, these bitches playing and scheming
I'm smoking out of my demons, I'm hoping momma don't see this
Me living my life by the day and downplaying my genius
Like goddamn, will I go out like lead singers in rock bands
I think that suicide is closer than mic stands
When I say that, know that I'm meaning that you can fight
For you dreams, but losers stand in between it
Am I gonna fall to my fist or shall I conqueror my kingdom
Some days we make it happen, some days we playing dreamers
I wonder if daddy miss me, sometimes I scream fuck 'em
But I wonder if he miss me, sometimes I roll another
And I go to the store, plastic cup in my hand
I ain't tripping on hoes, you can have it, there's plenty
She was cheating on me and play me off like it's really
A consequence of my actions, like I drove you to sinning
And you a bitch, and even when you say you love me, you a bitch
I pray you crash like Caroline into a ditch
And then I pray you make it out without a stitch
Sometimes I pray for miracles like they exist
I question faith, I question God, I got a list
Of all my woes and all my lows, I give you this
Hey bro
You know what March, April, May, June, July, and about to be August, have in common, bro?
The fact that I still don't have your goddamn album
Why is it? I don't understand this process, dog, like how you got...
Yo, everybody was bumpin' your last shit
You don't want to get your next shit out? You don't care?
You don't care that they want to hear your next shit?
You just that good, huh?
That must be your whole thing then
Man you got until Friday, bro
I'm not asking no more, dog
You got until Friday; I'm not asking no more
Two pills and a Mac-11, red, blue, you choose
Tryna spit a few flows to get my money up
Look I'm 20 years old and I ain't done enough
And 'til the sun set, roll another blunt for my real nigga Kembe
I'm not only the leader but I follow the village
I swear them niggas is killing it in Chicago
Now put the gun down, waiting to put the world on 'em
I get tired of the problems and depression
The bitches and the bitching, come and get your girl, homie
Shallow dreams and broken hearts,  Black Benz's
They're tryna make, material wishes and spiritual blisses
They stay focused on inferior pictures, you got your mothafuckin' hands out

I hid so, so far away, so far away
But I still, I still hear the gun sounds
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang

Two kills from a Mac-11, red and blue, you lose
A nigga need bail so get your money out
I'm twenty years old and I ain't done enough
Lord, I swear I got the answers for my people, and bullets bring the reaper
I heard my first lie in a church from a preacher
I sank low cause that's where they want to keep us
Just give me love, give me sex, give me reefer
And after school getting high with the teachers
I tried to promise my momma I'd make it honest
Say what's on your heart I promise they call it conscience
And conscious don't make no dollars, no dollars unless you Common
Now get your mothafuckin' hands out

I hid so, so far away, so far away
But I still, I still hear the gun sounds
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang

I hid so, so far away, so far away
But I still, I still hear the gun sounds
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Late nights, stay on it
Bright lights, they want it
And it's funny how you so charismatic
A sex addict, but stay lonely
Throw a beat on, I kill it
Not a gun though, my feelings
Here comes slow, pop pilling
And I die young, God willing
God willing, shit
Got me over here tripping
And liquor don't help for the feelings I felt
I'm just over here chilling
Yeah, always seem to blame a bitch
The only thing I got is my pain and shit
And these hoes want art
Love over your canvases
Should I talk about my dad or something?
Always feel like I'm mad for nothing
Rap fast cause a crash is coming
And it hurts for the words but it lasts for something
Po Pimpin' so Do or Die
Slit wrists, so suicidal
Stay cool in a pool of fire
Worship in a verse, nigga who's your idol?
Ain't never felt like this before
Would you ride for freedom? Would you die for freedom?
Got a ski mask on and a pistol loaded
Hear money talking, I die to meet 'em
Looking forward to the bright lights
Late nights and the bullshit
Yeah, they was talking that good shit
That's far as they could get, yeah
Aww, them titties that I sleep on, beneath the thump?
The beating broken heart, but it keep going
Disgusted with that fake ass smile, that you keep on
And you ain't got the nuts to say you hate me so I creep on
Down to your panties, down-down 'til you scream out
"Now baby, just fuck me" Our relationship is more like hate a bitch
It's ugly, and these cuts getting deeper, it's fatal shit, it's bloody
It drove me to popping pills and drinking water too muddy
I'm saying "Can I use my hands baby? It's mine"
To them niggas that you sometimes share with, it's fine
That you think these eyes that I keep on staring with, it's blind
Yeah, I told you that I did not care bitch, I'm lying

You made me fall in love for a minute
You made me fall in love for a minute
You made me fall in love for a minute
You made me fall in love for a minute

Love ain't always so demanding, sometimes it's just you
And we live life on different planets, but that ain't no excuse
And what we got is so withstanding, but sometimes we get bruised
And when the world don't understand me, I always got you
Man coming from a city where the heater bang
Nooga shooter Ruger, kill your brother that's that local fame
Always gave a fuck so much my Dockers wasn't Dickies man
Gotta keep it pimping James stomped them out, 44 deep, over cookies so
Imagine what they do to niggas acting like some pussy man
Austin daddy left him so abrupt now he hitting stains
Type of shit, make me say prayers for all my players
I’m here for all your fears you sell, I gotta scale
It’s real, riding, riding with my brother and his Lincoln
Got me thinking of get rich schemes for all my people
And maybe I should talk to my daddy, good karma
But fuck it I’m still stuck in these panties
Take relations for granted ‘stead of lowering standards
I did blow I didn’t plan it I’m understanding these addicts
Can you manage your habit? can you honestly practice?
All that shit that you preaching? always misplacing my glasses
But always peeping the evil like, I see it clear now
Like back in high school you’re the one that’s acting weird now
Had a baby in the 9th grade, shes old enough to cheer now
You see us getting money put that motherfuckin’ beer down
We’re here now

We here now mothafucka
I think we need some motivation
We’re here now mothafucka
Give me that Sydney Jones pussy
I think we need some motivation

Many nights I shot ball 'til lights
Cut off on flight so probably fell my life
My momma was probably right I fill shoes to height
That Kobe could fit ‘em tight these niggas here is light
To get ahead they living like parasites and mice
And pussy will make them fight, I’m be sippin' this fucking sprite
For fillers I couldn’t write my big homie had died
For niggas who living lies he’s six feet from life
I hope heaven treating him nice, why good die in spite?
When Sydney Jones get piped, she young, black, and trife
My light skin advice, she keep me hooked like Phife
My electric relaxation, her thighs give me escapism
With music make me anxious, nigga be all tasteless
Sometimes I feel like hatred will kill me if I do make it
Three stacks vacations, secluded living locations
Illest amount of payments to bank accounts that I’m making
Seasons changing for us and we adding a couple faces
These niggas get funny so Benjamin keep me racing
Everybody a actor wanna be the leading faces
So get your acting right the directors giving our placements

My niggas die for it, she got that pussy juice
I could lie for it, that pussy the truth
You got some time boy, then get some pussy too
I’m the nigga baby, what that pussy do
My niggas die for it, she got that pussy juice
I could lie for it, that pussy the truth
You got some time boy, go get some pussy too
(Give me that Sydney Jones pussy
I think them niggas need some motivation)
Hop on the road and say
That it was live last night
I know the world can wait

We don't usually take that long
I gotta, gotta new me, yeah
TV shows
We ain't that far from home
I used to could've, would've, should've
If I want it you be waitin' till the mornin' for real

Hurt in your eyes singing your song

You take me back to '99

You take me back to '99
I ain't been there in so long
You take me back to '99

I heard the moon ain’t got no service
But your mama got some cable
Tell me would you steal it from her?
I run away, I run away, it ain't nothin' on the TV
Baby tell me what you stealin' from
I tried to get to know you
Like lies and matrimony
I heard the moon ain't got no service
But your mama got some cable
Tell me would you steal it from her?

Is it okay to come down sometimes?
Wow it's so good comin' down

We don't usually take that long
I gotta, gotta new me, yeah
We don't usually take that long

Look at how I'm riding in my bucket, I be cooling
95 degrees, no A/C, but I be cooling
No exaggeration, fucking bitches, I be doing
My pockets hella empty, but these bitches steady choosing

To this pimping, I'm a student, I need a job
This rap ain't paying bills, okay, blame it on Rashad
I get all in my feelings gather, blame it all on God
But see that ain't the lesson that was taught up from my mom
I be that Pretty Nigga Flacko – fuck that shit, fuck that bitch
See that shit don't make no sense, he ain't even gotta lisp
It's so many fuck rappers, I can't even make a diss
It's so many fuck niggas, ain't no need to make a list
And tell my momma I'll be straight, all I need is dutches
Swishers, hide my insecurity, crowded by a bunch of niggas
They just don't be hearing me, you gon' start comparing me
Diamond in the rough, suck my dick, you'll see the clarity
Later I won't, won't be this same mothafucka
As soon as I get on, one insane mothafucka
I guess all them concussions, rattled brain mothafucka
And we don't wanna hear that weak shit, but you love it
I be high all in public, see sobriety's a struggle
They pay they bills hating, see, denying me's a hustle
I been drinking, I been drinking
See the fly in me, I'm buzzing (That weak shit)
Fake, fake, fake, feel me
(Hey)
Fake, fake
(Hey)
Fake, fake, fake, fake
(Hey, hey)

My shit go good with your mouth, don't it feel good?
It's a number 3, buckle up
Got to the scene it was bonafide pocket book
And 'cause you hide all my secrets from that bitch
They keep callin' your phone, I know he hate it
But the comet go
Keep us in tune and my hooker got another show
I'm on the road just to see if I can make it back
With just a scar and a carcass and a flaw
Like God and his kids
I know you hate us but it's nothin' else
They told me that I had to see it for my fuckin' self
And if I make to the gates and he don't recognize
That I had all them traits of greatness and the starlight at my feet
So don't you take me to the preacher

'Cause I might testify, ay
Baby today
I might testify someday
Get it on my way
And I'm just a boy

Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, haha, yeah

And I ain't done with your mouth
Say that as good as a number 3
Want some more, you got away with the tongue-in-cheek
Never seen, I know the code to your body
And the road to the vision is all communication
And we bust a nut
I left a stain in your inner part
You let it grow
I know the words to your favorite and your everything
But I don't have time for you baby
I am all for the profit, I'm past my self-destruction
But you bring it back
I got a line for you waitin' in my Cadillac
'Cause you describe all the symptoms of a common fiend
You said you read to the fire
It was good with the preacher and all the congregation
Would you testify?

I guess he at it again like
I guess he at it again like
I guess he at it again like
Let me put your knees to your chest and get ready
Let me put your knees to your chest and get ready

Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, fingertips, masturbate
Alright pimps, hoes, pimps, pimps, pimps, ah

Huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh
Everybody's invited
Everybody
The no stoner, has a boner, I need head and some sex
Sometimes vulgar, I'm quite Homer, dream 'bout booze and some tits
Speak 'bout bitches less than often cause they lie for the dick
Thus an evil of a creature, who plays games on gent
I sit lonely in my Honda, behind darkest of tint
Smoke a woodtip for my problems and give Brandy a sip
Get confided in the voice, spill my feelings and shit
Breaking codes and regulations, not a pimp nor a simp
Give me things that make me happy, cause the bottom I hit
Fuck a bowl, give me love, fuck your words, give me drugs Promethazine, a nice to meet you, you made bitch niggas all seem to
Misuse the words of trill, hold the gun so they real
'til their face in the reel, watch a real nigga squeal
When the piglets peal, the tabs off of your grill
Yeah you chirping, pleading deals with your faggot ass

Been sipping on this, stop telling me, start to get sober
Bill Bellamy, tickle my bellilly, I would do anything just to get over
So I drank sometimes, then I paint these rhymes, pardon me, I'm antsy
Why? My heart quite nervous, '95 I'm swerving, then I hit them curbs
No then boys ain't working, fuck a black Suburban, commissary purchase
My daddy calls, I barely answer, fuck parental curses
I spit too many verses, I know you fucking heard 'em
So why you leave them voicemails that you know gone hurt me
Tired of rapping that real shit, if nobody gone feel this
I could be gripping that steel shit, you too busy to deal with
It's like, they told me all the time "You got the gift of the gab"
Finally niggas is listening, yeah, then I just start with this missing my dad

Damn, so like when... you gone quit? You trill now, huh?
You cool, huh? You real? You real, that's what's popular, huh?
That's cool, you UGK for life, huh? Boy Stop
I was singing my song for nobody

I'm like a Rolling Stone rolling stone
And I'm the shit playa, but don't flush your commode
And I hope you smell me, but this Polo cologne
Slamming doors like I got an attitude or something wrong
It's like I'm switching cars the way I them holding on the
Every word I spit like I got a lisp and it is hella strong
Kicks like they came to play this off a house party
And you niggas look gay, like Jesse McCartney
It to be real it wouldn't be logic to fuck with me
Cause we on some Adele shit, we be rolling deep
Your girl get mad when I pass and I don't even speak
Prolly cause I got all up inside and was behind her teeth
I need a piece of at least if I can get the whole cake
Cause I be going all in like a young Drake
Yeah, you probably didn't get that like money
Yeah, you probably didn't get that
Imma keep it real cause some liars don't do that
And Imma blow cause I've seen a fucking fire do that
And Imma take a trick magicians be like how he do that?
And I be killing beats rappers be like why he do that?
Bitches say I'm clean and I don't even try to dress
I could fuck her though but I ain't even tryna sex
I got her number man and I ain't even tryna text
I strong armed dude and I ain't gotta flex
I spit profound shit that I could never lose
And I was better than half these dudes back in middle school
And I remember days like this
Tapping out the whole world with a pen in my wrist
Freestyling in class I bet the teacher was pissed
I probably should've paid more attention, yeah i'm slick
But bitch I probably won't be like this no more
I thunk outside the box and they won't let me back in that ho
Damn..

Yeah
Lounging with my feet up
Them lame motherfuckers drop their faces when they see us
We could play pretend them niggas still couldn't be us
Back in Chattanooga still couldn't Tennessee us
It's conflict when I'm writing these rhymes
Tryna fit my whole life up in thirty two lines but
I keep it real that's how it happened
The government gonna try to do me in like Fred Hampton, a black panther
Let's keep it real from the Hamptons
A penny saving, minimum wage is some shit, plantation
Slaves to the modern day, swimming Frank Ocean
Guns waving guns blazing filling in the holster
All I need is some cake like a fuckin' Hostess
At a table can't eat, grab a fuckin' hostess
Put my back against the wall like a fuckin' poster
Put my money on the table like a fuckin' coaster
Who's better? You's better? That's fuckin' bogus
I got your bitch up in my sheets like a fuckin' toga
Positions in some shit, sexual yoga
Master of that pussy, sexual Yoda
Jedi mind tricks watch that nine dip
That's food for thoughts, 9 clips

Yeah
All I need in this life is a bitch and a blunt
Good head and cooked food is all a nigga want
I don't trust too many niggas so my circle small
Never let 'em hear my feelings only pussy involved
I know it's kinda cold but the fuck is you to judge me
The last time I fell in love man I damn near lost me
So I spit my feelings in these raps to get my feelings back
Cause lately I been feeling lost stranded like I need map
Tired of the bullshit so I need a nap
I'm hungry for this music shit so I'm eating tracks
Flow hotter than anniversary candle wax
I'm feeling sorry for the competition cause they lack
Originality, imagine they shittin style
I'm looking like a vet and you been at this for awhile
21 years old, nigga no pressure
I cop your bitch with ease dog, I'm talking no effort
Don't be mad at me, bruh, cause she chose greatness
It was long overdue cause you kept her waiting
She fell in love with my poetic flow and way with words
All this time you playing daddy but the kid ain't even yours
I gotta, um... I been drinking
I feel like making fun of niggas (Bitch)

Ay, bitch I'm back, nah, I'm just starting
Man them niggas gonna hold you back, you're retarded
Crazy loc told me hold that gat, don't be a target
Quit smoking them blacks, practice performing
Bitch I'm back again, and I'm rolling, see I really mean that shit
She 'bout 5'5" and she rude, man I really queen that bitch
And ain't did shit, and ain't paid
I ain't tryna seem that rich
Can I get a discount on these Lays?
Is he 'bout to kill this rhyme where you stay?
So how you different? How you unique?
Who you tempting? Where's your mystique?
I just ride around in my Bentley, it's a Civic
See the women love when I'm honest, they said it's different
I don't get how all these rappers be so successful
They tell you lies, and nothing helpful
But you claim you feel it, yeah that's your man though
You stand for him, but what he stand for?

I'm just riding 'round getting paid
Fucking bitches, getting paid, gusto

Hey, bitch I'm back, like where the fuck I started?
These niggas thinking they the shit, but they ain't even really farted
Really thinking that a nigga on blaze, I ain't even tryna spark it
Your chick be all on my cock and balls, now tell your bitch quit gargling
I promise I'm authentic, straight genuine
I working out, shit I'm in the same gym you in
So he got a big deal? Big deal
So what he spit some shit that ain't real?
Get lit and write some shit you can't feel
So you can get expensive shit and switch heels
Goddamn, that's a problem, y'all fucking up my genre
See me? I'm a pro-masturbater
Nigga I be killing and spitting it when I rap
Yearn for the cat, he be earning the map
Got a hole in her teeth, put my sperm in her gap
Camerino on the job
Why these niggas so wack, let me ask Rashad
Let me ask a motherfucker like you
Who speak weak shit, cause the clique said "Cool"
They say "Bro you the shit, man the world gonna be bumping this
When you get real big and put us on, are we all gonna be rich?"
Get off my dick nigga, we ain't friends
Just another bitch with another loose end
See you at the top, and until then
Just choke on my pubes and swallow my kids
Back again and I'm rolling, got a pack of Swish and a bag of thizz
Like a stash of Swiss and I blow it, tell my brother "Up to ride"
But them niggas firing up that reggie, man
And can't have them fuck niggas in your regime
Suck dick, roll weed on the résumé
Bald head, damn near do everything
She do everything and I like it
Bend that ass over, baby, I'll bite it
Like to role play, be a stripper, baby
I'll tip her, baby, this pimping, baby, just Rosé
And I'm drunker than I should be
I'm fucking too honest but I could be
Another fuck nigga rapping 'bout wrapping
Flipping O's by rap and hip-hop, boy, you could be
I don't believe that shit Nigga, how the fuck you trill?
Nigga, how the fuck you real? Nigga, how the fuck you feel?
You don't feel shit, and I feel it in my heart: you a real bitch
You don't steel tip, Texas swanging
Texas slanging, Rikki Blu straight Texas
He'll wreck your paint, I'm the type
To fuck your bitch to the record playing, "I'm a fan, mane"
Fuck that, nigga, nigga, you the man, mane
Gotta let a bitch nigga do his damn thang
Even crooked politicians get a campaign
Need Henny, too broke for the champagne
But I still keep it G every damn day
Memorize every word that a fan say
We the House, bitch niggas, to your family
Don't let your bitch 'round me, I'm a girl prey
All I need is good pussy and a place to chill
Couple hundred thousand, gotta pay some bills
Gotta stack for my lil' nigga college tuition
He fifteen, I'mma have him in the college with bitches
Gotta let the flow age, nigga, prolly to glisten
I was in the Windy city, nigga, study the ism
Triangle offense, nigga, study the prism
I was just locked up, bitches land you in prison, but

Do you like that shit?
Roll up for me baby, light that shit
Oh, you love how I write that shit?
I do it better when you like that shit, come on

Late nights, these late nights, I pray to God they pay off
For these hard times we done been through
Got me still screaming "Fuck school"
And the police got my shirt off sitting in the MC
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling like Rich B-O-Y
Nigga got wings and still can't fly
Throw some D's off on my ride, throw some D off in your wife
Pussy stay off in my mind but the Pimp C, little P-A-C
Riding 'round, can't feel my feet, riding 'round, lost my ID
Drunk driving, spilling drink on my seat
Slurring words, bitch, you know me
Cause I'm the nigga, man fuck these niggas
And any bitch rusing for the weed
Bitch, get a gram, put it in the Swisher, man
Or I suppose whatever you get it in
Put it to your lips, get a light, gon' feel the glam
Tell me that it feel good, tell me all them lies
Make me feel good, let me, let me, let me feel real good
Give you my life, give you my life if I really could
But I know that I should, follow my steps
Get a little money in the process, 9-2 to the fucking death
House what I mothafuckin' rep, feel me, bitch, feel me
'til my body go down to the depths to the crevasse of the Earth
The circle of the circle, roll circuits of the purple
And the golds stay gleaming, fuck niggas stay scheming
Fishing hooks in the sky, young nigga Kareem-ing
Full bucket and a dream, nigga looking for wishes
Still grab my dick screaming "Fuck these bitches"


Yeah, Texas Trill, that Texas trill, Triple D, that Texas trill
Pleasant Grove, that Texas trill, Oak Cliff, that Texas trill
West Dallas, that Texas trill, East Dallas, that Texas trill
North Dallas, that Texas trill, Sunny South, that Texas trill
Two Podners, Texas trill, Rudy's Chicken, Texas trill
Eastside, Texas trill, Westside, Texas Trill
That Texas trill, Texas trill, Blue Family Grove, Texas trill
Blu From The Grove, Texas trill, Texas trill, yeah, Texas trill
Go back the way you came
Wrong way uh, if you stay
Prepare to have yo' shit rearranged
The way, I say

Where gold niggas spoon whipping over Pyrex
And brown skin acute spineless
With two kids, hood-minded
See adolescents fall victim to the mindless
Yeah, so baby-sitters, if you love us
And never pet the piggies, hide the chickens in the covers
See that's the family stones and drop jewels
That's the only way the family love us
My momma water whipping while my daddy in a jail
Cause fast life look better than a J-O
And don't this feel like '95 nigga?
A drive-by killed 5 niggas
So what you doing with your life nigga?
And I reply, "Getting high, nigga"
An introduction to the hopeless
Generations passed down to the dope biz

Like I ain't got no, no crazy-ass, cliche-ass, you know what I'm saying? One of those stories. One of those hip-hop stories coming from, you know what I'm saying, the struggle. We was in the hood but, you know what I'm saying? My momma never...she always got me what I, what I needed, she always provided for me even when my dad didn't. You know I had a pops, even when my dad wasn't always around, I always had a pops, so I don't know man, I always said I was gonna do this so I guess I'm tryna actually do it and I have fell in love with this shit man, I just love this shit

You better go back the way you came
Wrong way
If you stay
Prepare to have your shit rearranged
The way
I say
You better get on away from here
You gon see
It’s gon be some
Slow singing
And flower bringing
If my burglar alarm start
You don’t wanna fall in love with me
Far from a nigga, don't call me a nigga 'less you call me my nigga
I love niggas, I'm your only white friend
I bet you hate your own complexion, bet you wish you light skin
I dream a dream and write 'em like right then I bet you dreamed 'em before
But it's the hesitant the fear of all the shit you don't know
My momma told me not to listen to them bitches no more
And ever since I've been riding in my Honda solo, 4-door, it's kinda busted
It get me to my girlfriend house so I can bust it, I see potential
I feel it in my soul, kinda bitter with my father, tryna let that shit go
But I don't know

I wanna smoke the pain away but the weed'll get me fired
From a job that I need, where's the weed? (Man, fuck it)

I ain't tryna change the world, I just wanna change my own life
And transition a couple wrongs right, up
One of them long nights, contemplated suicide
In the mirror you and I, it's do or die
I love my poppa man
Them niggas without a father, hope the chopper jam
Big brothers and single mothers put they kids first
Bang bang, whoopty-whoop guess who was hit first, khaki
Bitch
I feel so dirty when I pitch it right
I make you nervous, how I get you right
Yeah, ay

I feel so dirty when I pitch it right, yeah
I make you nervous, how I get you right, yeah
I think my hoe might be the preacher wife, yeah
I mean my hoe might be the sneaky type, yeah
I got some dope, I got some dope to ship, yeah
I heard you up and on that overkill, yeah
You prolly dump me when I'm over here, yeah
Yeah, I might quit poppin' for my mama, for my, yeah
Yeah, I had a double with a downer, out in Dublin
Tell a bitch talk dirty to my other head
Yeah, the prison wall or water fountain with the liquor call
If them bitches call, I'm the rhetoric
Yeah, I got to quit fucking with that medicine
Guilt trips give me stiff lips and a pair of kids
This my enemy, this my bro, this my other bitch
What you want to do? On the real, this some gutter shit
So-Cal, cutter, I smile for the fuck of it
East side nigga, Chat-town with no funnel cake
Ink pen got me more bands than my brother make
Resonate, put that Fen away, let me elevate
Thank god for my bank card and my get-a-way
That's a cool bitch, was my dog, just the other day
That's a cool bitch, was my dog, just the other day
Living dude, pimpin', are you down? Are you hungry?
Oh, say it loud, tell your friends I got hunnid dick
Dudes who done had the worst time be the funniest
Back when they call me Akon, I was running shit
Vision is, 60-40 something, but I'm kickin' it
Wait, I was taught as a lil, it's only pimpin' bitch
You just get it and live, and watch the chemistry
Look, now, found me a pill, I got another string
Blacked out, tripping again, and made another me

All by myself, I felt ashamed
Please bring me down
Please bring me down
All by myself, I felt ashamed
Please bring me down
Please bring me down

I need the white walls, white halls
Where it ain't that hard to be myself
Thank God, thank God
I'm here, I'm home
I need the white walls, the white halls
Where it ain't that hard to be myself
Thank God, thank God
I'm here, I'm home
I need the white walls, white walls
Where it...
Got me feelin like please bring me down
Please bring me down
I need the white walls, white walls
Please bring me down
Please bring me down
I'm dark skinned so please don't take me lightly
Stogie in my hand, begging, "Please light me"
Again, don't this feel like '96 or '95?
It was in his hand with this dude, while I drive

Pass out in the sheets with a freak, should I creep with her?
I'm too tired, we don't fuck, I just sleep with her
And baby momma's still pasty
She found the rubbers in my dresser (God bless her)
Third trimester I don't really wanna stress her
So daddy will deny her, orgasms I supply 'em
To the women that inspired all the rhymes I wrote
And kill millions of civilians with the nines I tote
I'm just young, dumb and ignorant
I couldn't go to college so I settled to be a nigga then paper chasing
I wonder if the government formulating
This chemistry that got 'em rich niggas paper racist
It seems that I'm a goner, so I escape aromas
Of that hate with weed and marijuana
And conforming is what I'm living with
Cause you die if you different, and now I'm smoking

And don't this feel like '95 nigga...

I've been smoking and drinking, now I am drinking and driving
Suicide on my mind but at least I got my pride right
Tryna hit up Bree cause at least she get my mind right
Speeding through traffic was that a stop sign-lights flashing, seem like magic
Blue and red inspiration reaching for the masses
Life is do or die and Ima die making classics
They killing me with books, cafeterias and classes, and I be like
"Lord I ain't your best son and man on that liquor I confess some"
My soul get the weakest when the flesh come
Religious ass bitches, just praying I undress 'em
I got a problem with my pops should I talk about it?
Relationships get tore was you off about it
You saying these A&Rs ain't shit just looking for a bitch
That can spit a few hits should i bark about it
Its like I am aiming at myself young Plaxico
My soul hurts ain't never felt regret before
Me and this bitch ain't never ever met before
I am cheating but pussy ain't never ever felt this wet before
Lord should I let it go in poverty but the change is blinding
Somewhere in between the fame and insane asylums
Charlie Sheening on that bitch, still dreaming of that shit
They praying that a nigga fucking Willie Beamen on that shit (Fame)
Four blunts is this as high as we can get
I spit my soul and pay the toll and let my momma play it
For her friends, she bragging about a Benz, that I can't buy, but eventually
Get that thang right and treat me like Zack Morris up in Bayside
I kill the vocals, kill the beat, and let the bass ride

Let me sing my song, I free my soul, I free my soul
So let me, le...let me free my soul, I sing my song, I free my...
Baby hold my chalice, this some pimp shit
This that stay over with my daddy and his mistress
I could drink hundred proof a gallon, fuck a kidney
Fuck with me, I just want some balance and some bitches
Fuck a dream, I say anything is realistic
I see a challenge Imma gun it down like it offend me
I suppose, Lordy take my vision off the pussy hole
Few are chose, God I wanna say it, but they took it wrong
Back the hoes, can I change the world with Cadillacs and Volks?
Can I breed it like we need it like we back to back we bought?
I don't want my child to grow up feeling like his daddy gone
Daddy left, feeling just like me I'm waiting on your steps
What is blessed?
How I end up rapping, how we feeling stressed?
Shit I'm back to burgers in the locals if you ain't impressed
I need motivation, all I'm asking is you bring your best
Rain is just another confrontation, know that life a bitch
Life is this
Yeah, this for free, you been tryna get a plate (free lunch)
You ain't smokin', you just lookin' for an 8th (uh uh)
How you ballin' if you ain't got the skates? (Ain't got the skates)
I've been nuttin' on this bitch from the Bay (from the Bay)
Sellin' out, bring my friends, you my dawg (my dawg)
Fill my fronto like an arm in the cigar (the cigar)
If I don't smoke before I eat then I'ma starve (then I'ma starve)
I throw that platinum on my teeth when I'm with y'all
Preacher man, Mr. Willie, put some hands on my dinner
Put some eyes in my back, let me scope out these niggas
You a nobody, ain't nobody to nobody, nigga
I'ma quit when a bitch suck the flow out a nigga, uh
What's the word? I'm just tryna get a zip (amen)
But your plug always talkin' out my ear (amen)
At the window tryna hop up in the VIP (amen)
Swear you niggas be more thirsty than your bitch
Broke hoes always tryna tell me what I should do
With this change that I make and this groove that I grew
This your broad on the phone, this that raw on the phone
It's expensive and tucked, what's the brand? I don't know
Ain't concerned with that shit, too concerned with this grip
L.A. bitches only wanna sniff the coke off the tip
We can chill, you can hang like a rope off the dick
Celebrate, bring up dope, bring some pour out this bitch

Fuck a Vine, I'm just tryna get some face (amen)
Soon as I beat the face, bitch I did the race (amen)
Bust a nut, then I go out my way (go out my way)
Get the guap, then I go out my way (go out my way)

Yeah, go out my
Amen, ayy
See how I picked up the headphone jack and just kept goin'?

Isaiah Rashad

Look, I'm ridin' on faith, well Delta, I hope the prayers can help us
I'm havin' no problem bein' selfish
They say God is who gon' guide ya, warrior or friend turned foe?
Who behind ya, where the knife at?
Still debatin' with the Devil for your life back
New dress, sinnin' look tempin' with a night cap
Lately I've been diggin' in her kidney cause she like that
I'll be right back, right back, right back
I got lettuce for you I got binkies and beanies and cheddar for you
I'm just talkin' to my son and my perfect woman
You might see a couple mil' if we don't kill each other
So ride with me like you love me like we feel each other
And if we lose we in the mood then don't forget each other
Sometimes the styrofoam cups is the perfect of couple
They got us runnin' from the field with a Perc' or something

I promise
I-I-I-I promise not to lead you astray
I promise
I promise
I remember we used to get high
I promise
I won't forget it
I promise
We used to get high
I remember
I won't forget you
I-I-I promise
These drugs do get to me

And I could touch your soul
Look at me now look at me running

I promise
Yea, yea
Just to get
I won’t forget
I promise
A body map of Isaiah Rashad's tattoos, starting from the shoulders, working down to -----

Right Arm:
• T.D.E. Logo
• STAY (+)

Left Arm:
• Unrecognizable Cursive Writing
• The House
Late nights, stay on it
Bright lights, they want it
And it's funny how you so charismatic
A sex addict, but stay lonely
Throw a beat on, I kill it
Not a gun though, my feelings
Here comes slow, pop pilling
And I die young, God willing
God willing, shit
Got me over here tripping
And liquor don't help for the feelings I felt
I'm just over here chilling
Yeah, always seem to blame a bitch
The only thing I got is my pain and shit
And these hoes want art
Love over your canvases
Should I talk about my dad or something?
Always feel like I'm mad for nothing
Rap fast cause a crash is coming
And it hurts for the words but it lasts for something
Po Pimpin' so Do or Die
Slit wrists, so suicidal
Stay cool in a pool of fire
Worship in a verse, nigga who's your idol?
Ain't never felt like this before
Would you ride for freedom? Would you die for freedom?
Got a ski mask on and a pistol loaded
Hear money talking, I die to meet 'em
Looking forward to the bright lights
Late nights and the bullshit
Yeah, they was talking that good shit
That's far as they could get, yeah
Came out busting
Came out bluffing
Came out fucking
On your cousin
I do all these floozes voices
And they natted, what you love her
You in trouble, out here sunny
Imma barbecue with Satan
Bitch you busy, it ain't shit
I went shopping, left it running
Check my hundreds, check my onion
We watch cable at my Auntie's
When my papa wasn't trapping
But my coco 
Mr. Magic Billy Batson
Mr. Magic Billy Batson
Miss me with that loco 
On a nigga, get it cracking
I'm not surprised, I'm on a ride
Been on a ride, where is my eyes
Spamming a lie, just hold it down
All I require, just hold it down
They go shit talking when we not around
Niggas be hating when feet on the ground
Act like the chick with a beat on her couch
Nut on her coochie and then beat on her mouth
Came out bussin (16x)
I roll red, I'm so cunning
High tech digit, flat four button
Bad boy shawty, that boy probably
Nascar Audi, Swanton Bomb it
Two white bitches, still gon' pick it
Fly shit kick it, still cold digit
Young like Slizzy, get back witcha
Step back, hit em with the step back swish it
, hoping that her nut might glisten
Shit might triple, shit might missile
She might hit you, Willy Wonka,in my codeine
Then my , then my nigga
I been stacking for a really
Please be with it, please be for it
Never control it, I can't control it
