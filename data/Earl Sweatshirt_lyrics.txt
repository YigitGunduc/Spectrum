Promise Heron I'll put my fist up, after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain
With that fucking flow that s-s-so belittles men
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas, nigga listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it, in turn, these critics and interns
Admitting the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces
Writ, it affixed, learning them digits
And simultaneously, dispelling one-trick-pony myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fucking six-nigga energy
And crawling down 'Fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shouting, thrashing
These niggas done let the Kraken out
Crack-a-lacking, like snap, crackle, popping your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga

'87 roof top, Bronson
Whipping hoopties tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock vomit up
Sub rocking, thud knocking niggas teeth loose
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop
Rolling with that flow swamp
Catch me over stove top
Rapping to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothing, with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused
Like it's nothing, cause it's nothing, bitch

From a city that's recession-hit
With stress niggas could flex metal with
Peddle to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments, trying to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde, and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breaking news: death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fucking sky that you praying to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
Disappear again, reappear bearded
On top of a lear, steering it into the kids' ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot Earl
Rawer than the skinned knee cap on the blacktop
Salivary glands, lighter fluid for the matchbox
Striking, wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy, oh boy, I'm bad as burnt pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the Little Nick, nimble, rickrolling
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit

87 roof top, Bronson
Whipping hoopties tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock vomit up
Sub rocking, thud knocking niggas teeth looseBruh, I don't fuck with no cop
Rolling with that flow swamp
Catch me over stove top
Rapping to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothing, with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused
Like it's nothing, cause it's nothing, bitch

Quit with all that tough talk
Bruh we know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down, bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed, I'm ready to kill
So test it, all my weapons is real
Selling thizz, couldn't tell him what the recipe is
Got 'em wishing that they never gave these weapons to kids
Cheers, send chills up spines of fat bitches
After shows throwing out sandwiches
Niggas get it how they live and I live for money
Other words, I'm getting money
Lil Boy told me when it's time to ride they'll send up for me
Ain't nobody scaring me
Niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94, would've had 'em walking down Death Row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me, "Wet 'em if they test you"
So it's Raging Waters season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seeing
Kitten soft but in they songs be trapping hard as Jeezy
I don't believe it, but to each his own
I ain't tripping long as I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass
Tell 'em "Free Smalls," off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief for police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby J, bony niggas spraying K's
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain

Like it's nothing, cause it's nothing, bitch
Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

"Can I get that, oh... let me get that beat in my headphones, louder."

It's probably been twelve years since my father left, left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly I miss this nigga, like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened, it's evident
In them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at?

Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

"Can I get that, oh... let me get that beat in my headphones, louder."

Uh... time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome, trying to make it from the bottom of Syd's
Feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, "I like attention"
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right? Like, "Thanks so much, you made my life
Harder, and the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit"
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

"Can I get that, oh... let me get that beat in my headphones, louder."
I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into, and I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you, I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket,and this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the Logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a profit, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
She, she seems that

All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like

I’m coming back I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
I’ll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
And you parade my homecoming, don’t cry
You know I can’t live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I’d be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please
Palm, no marijuana, trees
Your hickies on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I’m playing surfboarder, put whisky in that salt water
I emptied every canteen just to wear that straight edge varsity you think’s cool
They thought me soft in High School, thank God I’m jagged
Forgot you don’t like it rough, I mean he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean how anal am I gon' be when I’m aiming my gun
And why’s his mug all bloody, that was a three on one?
Standing ovation at Staples I got my Grammy’s and gold
Polka dots on my Brit, I’m not supposed to be stunting
It’s all melodic this song, I catch this vibe in my sleep
But I’m just jet-lagged is all, and restless

All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you’s a little different I don’t like you a lot
I mean…fuck

I don’t know what we’re about
What good is West Coast weather if you’re bi-polar?
If I'mma need this sweater, I’d rather be where it’s cold
Where it snows, I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls, I know they’re coming in droves
You’ll only miss when it goes
Yeah, I think that’s it
When it goes
Yo, I'm a hot and bothered astronaut
Crashing while jacking off
To buffering vids of Asher Roth eating apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets, and laugh it off
Twisted, sicker than mad cattle, in fact I'm off
Six different liquors, with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screaming, bitch, you shouldn't be that alarmed
When Big Lips is in the attic, armed with an addict's arm
Earl puts the "ass" in "assassin"
Puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic
Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fucking cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, she dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, asking where her ass go
In my room, redefining the meaning of black holes
Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
It's O.F., buttercup; go ahead, fuck with us
Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song, invade her thong
My dick is having guts for lunch, as well as supper
Then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard
Fucking nosey neighbors notice something's up
"What you doing?" – nothing much
Would shout some other stuff
Got to fucking bounce, guess the bouncer's had enough of us

Get up off the pavement, wipe the dirt and vomit off
DopeBoyz hating, but them faggots is a lot of talk
Cotton soft pussy, them Odd niggas is Molotov
Cocktails; fucking toss one in your apartment, dog
Wolf Gang, we ain't barking, nah
Try talking on a blog with your fucking arms cut off
Put in a carpet and watch it get auctioned off
The Ace tell Shake's daughter
"We're sorry, but papa's gone, bitch!"
"Nah, no, nah, nah, fuck that. Niggas think cause you fucking made 'Chum' and got all personal that niggas won't go back to that old fucking 2010 shit about talking 'bout fucking everything-all. No, fuck that, nigga, I got you. Fuck that."

Grab mittens who have to spit blizzardous
Actually flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, eight nickels of hash, delay quick, and then
Dash to Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Raquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, momma and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezzle stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea-kettle songs

Four deep in a Rover cannon
Riding dirty through a Saugus canyon, niggas know that it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
50 K for the last check
But the Dollar Menu still be on deck, nigga it's the mothafuckin'
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G

Yeah, the misadventures of a shit-talker
Pissed as Rick Ross's fifth sip off his sixth lager
Known to sit and wash the sins off at the pitch alter
Hat never backwards like the print off legit manga
Get it? Like a blue pill, make ya stick longer
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick 
Thaw it out, toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

Posing nigga try to disrespect
Get a fucking thunder to his neck, shout out to Nak, cause it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
Looking bummy, posted on the block, like I ain't make
A quarter million off of socks, nigga, cause it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
Alright
Uh, uh, uh

Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
Step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it
Don't give a fuck, pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel
We had females come in every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focused on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob, scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand
Steady handling my job, time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent nigga's shit
Bitch

Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

My fleeting thoughts on a leash
For the moment, high as fuck
I've been alone in my shit, for the longest
Snakes sliding in the street
Momma taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them
Pigs, riding in 'em
I'm a target so it's hard to even eye me in 'em
If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him
There's no time for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight
Like a collar when you iron that
Thinking 'bout my grandmama, find a bottle
I'mma wallow when I lie in that
I just want my time and my mind intact
When they both gone, you can't buy 'em back
"What's up, nigga? Why you so depressed and sad all the time like a little bitch? What's the problem, man? Niggas want to hear you rap. Don't nobody care about how you feel, we want raps, nigga."

My grandma's passing
But I'm too busy tryna get this fuckin' album cracking to see her
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen (Cut that bitch off)
And my priorities fucked up, I know it, I'm afraid I'm going to blow it
And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?
Talk all you want, I'm taking no advice, nigga
I'm 'bout to relish in this anguish, and I'm stressing over payment
So don't tell me that I made it, only relatively famous
In the midst of a tornado, misfitted, I'm Clark Gable
I'm not stable, abrasive as fuck and they all
Pay me, I'm chuckling cross-faded in public
Heart racing 'til blunt is lit like, "He don't give a fuck again, right?"

"Hey Thebe, nigga, what's up nigga? I heard you back, I need them raps, nigga. I need the verse, I don't care about what you going through or what you gotta do nigga, I need bars, sixteen of 'em."

I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit
Judging by the pants and the mall grip
Gully, in the vans with the dark tints
I'm a start-shit type nigga
Night life living
Riding in the Jeep, I'mma side-swipe niggas
What's your life like? That's alright nigga
Hammer in the left ready when the price isn't
Right got the whip and I ain't got the license for it
And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it
The nicest doin' it, who the fuck you staring at?
Acting like you've never seen a tooth that's carat-capped
Bars hotter than the blocks where we be at
Stuntin' these niggas gon' flop like Divac
See that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga, believe that nigga
You see that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga, believe that, nigga
Uh, was always smartmouthed and quick-witted
But somethin' was always missin' like six digits, lucky seven
Probably poppa, little nigga so they picked on him, hassled him
Things changed when I hassled back, so, David hit the pavement
With this grapple rap, Snapple fact: you rather wack
While I am poppin' like a snappin' crack
So high you could see like Tallahass, the opposite of cataracts
Matter fact I am Farmer John milkin' cattle tracks
Action packed nipple squeezin', boy colder than sniffle season
Simple genius, go hard and spit bits of semen
So when the street is split, don't act surprised, agree with it
The gang of wolves that creeps in crypts
As deep as Dawson's Creek and shit
I pray they got gills either that or grab some floaties
I know I got skills, why you think I'm posted boastin'?
Braggin', tell these faggots to stop naggin'
Cause them Wolf Gang niggas threw them off the bandwagon like

Uh, was always fucked up as shit with it
But I didn't cross the line until the bridge hit it, troll
I got you niggas nervous like virgins flirtin' with Uncle Mervin
Fuckin' y'all with no lubricant, go grab the detergent
I preach to demons at your church, now I'm the newest sermon
Wearin' nothin' but they fuckin' blast with the matchin' turban
I drive through white suburbans in the black Suburban swervin'
Hittin' curbs and blastin' Erick Sermon, drunk off English bourbon
I'm stealin' purses rapin' nurses, I'm a crooked surgeon
And treat the beat like sanitized nazi puss, I'm a German
I'm squirtin' while I'm masturbatin' and regurgitatin'
From eatin' Miley Cyrus salad pussy platter they were servin'
My only purpose is to jerk it cause it has a curve
So bitches hate to do me like ex-convict community service
This my Zombie Circus, you better get a fuckin' ticket
Odd Future Wolf Gang, like they're filmin' Twilight in this bitch

I'm back on my sixty six sick shit
Flowin' like the blood out the competition's slit wrists
She lick it up, Dracula, then spit it back, back at ya
She mad as fuck, stuck in the back of a black Acura
Fed her acid now the duct tape quacks back at her
Hello Heather yellow feathers now you ain't laughin', huh

Bitch you're barely breathin' leavin' on the back of the boat
While I fill you up with semen from the Wolf Gang team and
Flowin' like the creampie inside of your daughter
Oughta eat the bitch with salt & wash it down with a gallon of water
I grab the saw and sawed off her arm and auctioned it
And dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
Fuckin' awesome, spittin' box of trees, got you niggas
Shakin' like it's Parkinsons from the clitoris of Kelly Clarkson's dick
Ironin' you niggas now it's time to starch the shit
Drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
Find a random abandoned garage and go to park in it
Find Earl laying on the burgundy carpet, pull my knife out
Sharpen it, stab him, put a arch on it
Pour unleaded gas on him, get the Zippo and spark the shit
Hop back in the van and then depart the bitch
Killed him on his own track, the faggot shouldn't have started it
After filling my reputation of whore beaters
Soared to Taco Bell and I ordered some gorditas
(Mmm, that's good!) Wanted four more, ordered em, then eat em
Then head to Thebe's house for some gymnastics
Fantastic, I backflip on this beat B
Cause we running shit like the Dingleberries on four cheetahs
Flow colder than Papa Joe's, old Domino's
Fuck it, whatever
Um... Trashwang scratched inside the knucks
Got some One Direction tickets, I should hit that up
Drive by with puppy signs plastered on the truck
Then see how many of they fans could fit inside the trunk
Move over the microwave and the cannabis
Try to take the van and the whole band to Canada
Fuck the block news and the venues, they can't handle us
They can't stand us including fruits that Frank's channeling
The Ku Klux Klan see me and my managers
But thank me when they ask where the Five Panels is
Man, I suck now, I ain't still dope
But Chris and Rihanna's fuckin' again so there's still hope
Oh fuck, I went there, balling bitch, I'm Ben's hair
Y'all barely breaking like Taco's self-esteem in a thin chair
Old Navy bitches love this gap, yeah this grin's rare
Watch a nigga smile like five-year-old child
I'm kicking it with Nak and the nigga from Green Mile, it's
Red Bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but
That's just all the sherm I was burning a little while ago
Don't let me get hold of that rifle
Shout my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo
Surrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style
And some freckled bitches with giant peaches that's vile
They never did catch that rhino

Squadron full of some lost souls
Sergeant of all, it's autumn and Nak just nollied a pothole
Non-cooperative with his momma's wishes for college
And coppers labeled a  problem since paying for Damianos
So shimmy through the swamp, nigga, follow me through the foxholes
Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos
Threw a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home
Shit, it's like 6 P.M. and his temple throbbing
Hand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies
Logo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile
Cautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines
Bitches augmented, stupid, as the group is, only slightly
Write precise to get a pussy nigga tooth chipped
Man these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now
Small fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing
Ease up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
From a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth
And teeing off, believe it's Golf Wang, nigga
Said this a hit of liquid heroin
Marilyn Manson channeling, panicking, spar with Anakin
'til one of us leave in an ambulance
Blow the smoke of the spliff in your eyes
You ain't gon' live 'til you die
Intelligent bitch on my side
She bitching I'm spitting habitual lies
I hit her up when my jet land
Got a swisher tucked in my headband
Front page news, I'm young Jesus
Eating bagels with no cable on
Been fucking hoes since when Mase was on
I hope that Based God hear my prayers
One day you're here, the next day you're gone
So me and Earl smoking weed on Jay Z's lawn
Some dope rap on your ho ass, Tony Womack
Don't hold back, no, feed your girl Cognac
Meet a bitch, sleeping wit her, feverish, diva chick
Met her off Twitter even Schindler keeps a list
Pittsburgh, broke down somewhere in a Fisker
I could pull your bitch with a whisper and diss her
Dumbass ho
She only dumb cause she love that though
Somewhere getting high reading Juxtapoz
I hit her up she come through and watch Adjustment Bureau
("That's a good movie!")
Moms love me cause I'm so commercial
I fuck 'em raw cause I know they fertile
In Myrtle Beach with a purple fleece
Hotel lobbies playing Für Elise
I'm Ron Burgundy mixed with Hercules
Slap a bitch in the mouth if she curse at me
I said Josh's beard is like Paul Revere
When he walk in the room it's like God is here
I'm at a prop shop in Montauk throwing tomohawks
At civilians... I'm chilling

I'm on the monitor nigga
She taking it like a champ
And I'm proud of her nigga
I'm on the couch where that loud is burning
I'm shouting, "I don't fuck with you"
Cause I don't, never love a ho
But we could play doctor, ma
Open wide for thermometer
Your cowgirl's crotch riding
With a clean, faded fro, lopsided
Tell the label that I want a white driver
And tell him give me space, I don't know that nigga
Bold-ass little fuckin' low-class villian
Whole van tinted, nope can't kill him
It's the Trashwang nigga, that's what's up
Half pint of hope in that plastic cup
Real nigga from the start 'til the casket shut
Present his own case as a basket one
Present-day based nigga, smack the judge
Riding with them same niggas ashin' blunts
While that bass make his face like he mad or somethin'
Slide in the safe, take the cash and run
Know that if he fake I'm harrassin' him
Took the big toe so they tagged the tongue
Out here stuntin' like I'm supposed to, dog
Blowing more smoke than a broke exhaust
Pipe only spirit that I hold's menthol
It's Wolf Gang bitch, like you know these paws
Living like it's '62
Spit and grip my genitals
My bitch to split the swisher
My niggas split the residuals

Hey, it's marijuana fields
Pot growing, blaring Gil Scott
Heron while we pill pop
Errand run and kill cop
Niggas know I feel not
For 'em, stop bitching, bruh
Stare and get that grill knocked open
Hey, it's marijuana fields
Pot growing, blaring Gil Scott
Heron while we pill pop
Errand run and kill cop
Niggas know I feel not
For 'em, stop bitching, bruh
Stare and get that grill knocked open
"Yeah... me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just tryna say somethin' before... I... I... drop it off."

I feel like the Tom Sawyer for real niggas
Looking for a problem, revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed, we will kill niggas
So try me if you want, bruh, I promise I'm with all of that
Late night shooters, got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white man's game with my heart intact
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
Norf norf is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait
Until the money coming in, spend it all on guns and rims
I ain't nothing but a nigga, ain't no reason to pretend

Kept his sticky in a Stussy pouch
Ski mask, bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty, night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles, sold sniff, Momma knew
Baggies laying 'round, peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns, welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at two, plotting, trying to garner loot
Split it with his big road dog, call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch, stiff collar on the button-up
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout to run amok
Road to Hell paved with cement, covered trussled drugs, toughen up

"Well, alright, okay. If that's how you truly feel about it, then
Alright, okay. If that's how you truly feel about it, then."

Vinny Stape, they stupid, think the city safe
Until that little bindi placed, headshots, red dot
Block as hot as Denny plates, fed watch, Fed watch
Opinions only pity based, deep in the Civic with the
Evilest niggas this side of the Mississippi
All courtesy of Vincent from niggas who plot against
Ear-L-double-S, hear shells from the Tec
Hear in full-effect, eat a dick and cut a check, bitch
Few niggas I'm on a first-name basis with
Address him by the alias, that trunk weighted like he
'Bout to catch a case again, eighths louder than the voice of
Satan that be plaguing him, bruh, I'm caking
Whether Hell or bad weather, high water, I'm a sailor-type
Assailant for the paper, living like I met the maker twice
Hit it 'til I'm faded right? Mami, take a hike
Or treat it like you fucking shaking dice, bitch

"Well, alright, okay. If that's how you truly feel about it, then
Alright, okay. If that's how you truly feel about it, then."
Search inside my purse to buy something worthless

99 problems all gone in that one joint
And that neck gold froze like he held it at gunpoint
I'm a bubble in the belly of the monster
With a duffel full of troubles, trunk rattle in the Mazda
Ragged with the contra, Phantom of the Opera
And I'm standing on the cop's truck, stacking for the long run
The bags packed, roadside with the thumb out
Toe tagged, don't gag, , spit your gum out
Nomadic, chrome-grabbing when it's danger
I'm a manger-born puppy, holding flight like a hangar do
Knife to the trachea, spit scabies and bet
The label don't like me but they pay me a grip
And you see how his day going by the state of his wrists
Y'all niggas busy Play-Dohing, bet the baker came swinging like
What the fuck you saying? All that aiming and miss
I'mma fuck the freckles off your bitch, nigga

I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch
We could do this shit all night
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch

You know me, drugs out, front the telly
I'm couch-drunk and ready to fuck, count fetti and bucks
Pack loud as that slap 'cross the belly
What's up? Fuck nigga, what's up? I'm at the deli
Scheming on a Fanta and a Camel Crush screaming "Saddle up!"
Like, "Fuck is beef?" Get your cattle cut, pansy
If them fans only local, why them flights trans-atlantied up?
The rice and the patty's cooked, nice for the chancellor
Them teeth with the gold bright, the light switches mad at us
Snap chatting panty clad baddies, I'm a bachelor
I'm high and polite cause po-lice is in back of us
And write with the same hand I smack 'em up with
Stretching out the fifteen I had initially
Icky Thump, sticky kush lit up in a rental Jeep

We could do this shit all night
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch
We could do this shit all night
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch
It’s money (x5)
All day
All day

Baby girl, what you want to do?
Hop in this 'Cedes, girl
She like where we going to
A new life, new world
Pop that molly, we hard-body
Glocks hot as Kemosabe
He said that he wanted beef
So we fed him hollows and got it popping
Fear and ego is the enemy
You ain't got to pretend with me
I need the wool, I'mma skin the sheep
And take the bull, skin it to the meat
You full of shit, we in too deep
I do this, she knew the deet
Like two feet, Flare two time
She wanna kick it like Bruce Lee
Brought you in, I'll take you out
Ball like Tim then I weighed it out
It's no work, we sling through droughts
The life of me, I'm just hanging out
Don't get comfortable and lay on the couch
I don't wanna see your ass laying down
Pop that pussy, twerk some
Cause most of these bitches work for nothing
Paid your dues, while you're Paid In Full
I can't wait to win, you wait to lose
Your mind of a failure, hate rules
When you settle for what you hate to do
I go the extra mile, I'm with the extras
Extended clips shoot through your necklace
Leave you breathless, that Tec is restless
Cause All My Children need the best, bitch
I need that Rothschild money, the top is sunny
I seen the light, and you blocked it from me
But I found my way to the top, I'm coming
Got that smack-dab base, like a rock-star drummer

I'm a problem to niggas
Pop artillery, the carbonates with him
Starving to hit 'em, spar with a nigga
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all in a minute
It's the ticket-dodging aristocrat
New bitch, whip with the system slaps
Mister slide in and skimp the sack
Nigga hit the function with a pick and axe
My nigga, miss me with the bullshit
Right here, right ear got a Pesto blunt
Why that shit got a young nigga Velcro stuck
Why your bitch go down when the sess go up
Hard as armed services, y'all might have heard of him
Escobarbarian, best call the lawyers up
Bruh, the broad Aryan, know the squad loiterers
Not with the grain and these bitch niggas' wishes
Dealt with addiction, fell for the bitch with the
Pale butter skin who just packed up and dipped
In the land of the rent-less, stand with my chips
In a stack and a grin, fuck 'em
Ma said "Wake up son, good morning"
I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn then
Paused to scratch an itch and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention 'cause I wasn't tryna kick it
With this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin it, so I grabbed my bag
And split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say that I fucking hate you
But
Maybe if you looked in this direction
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then
Feel the fucking life rushing through my body
But you got a guy that's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy
Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador
You light me up like lamps, a chance is all I'm really asking for
Give me one, I promise I'll be back for more
Most wanna tap and score, I want a fam of four

Not like a family of four, just like.. fuck it
You'll never listen to this shit anyways, fuck you... bitch

She said "You rushing, you rabid son of a Labrador"
But I'm attracted to you like teenyboppers to Apple Stores
The basement light is darkened, the switchblade is sharpened
Her name on my arm and her face on a two percent carton
See her face while you're fixing your breakfast
And know she's in my basement, objecting to sex with
Me, murder spree, surges on with the next bitch
Tombstones read RIP cause it's pieces they rest in
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

Wolf with a T-Rex cock, less talk
While I invest stock in wet rock
Smoke with all the big bitches bumping "Bedrock"
Sub in the trunk, thumping up against the dead cops
And pop it like I tossed a match in the engine
And go harder than a fucking crack intervention
Clown of the class and the last to attend it
Big Earl make you fags stand at attention
Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking general
Catch 'em where them slap, slash, stab bitch ass niggas go
Girl, you ain't even gotta ask cause you finna know
Why this Playboy so sticky in this centerfold
Sticky what my niggas blow, icky Earl finish foes
Hit 'em low, riddle them with Chronicles of Riddick bows
Chronic in the spliff to the dome, got my system slow
So I'm walking out, ask them niggas what they sprinting fo'

All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

Black Ted Bundy sick as John Gacy
Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store
She frequented to help support the habit picked up in the fourth
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it
Slipped of a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it
Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch
So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit
Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette
Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment
Stash it where we hide the marijuana and the condoms
"Hey, what's that?" Don't touch it or even fucking look
You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fucking book

All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

Yo Vince, let me tell you 'bout these hoes I met last night
They thought I was cute 'til I asked what that ass like
Damn right, red light, ran right through it
"You don't even have your permit, what the fuck are you doing?"
Maybe if you shut the fuck up, we'd be cruising
And you wouldn't be sitting, boohooing 'bout your bruises
But no, you wanna be Miss Fuck-with-the-Music
I'm zoning on Relapse, she's sliding on Blueprint
Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue
With my hands around her throat, her arms stopped moving
Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused
As I turn to tell them both not to do shit stupid
Red, white, blue lights in the rear-view, shit
Swerved to the shoulder, tell them both no moving
Sit down in the back, cause the windows tinted
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship
"Aren't you a little too young to be driving?"
Look Officer, I'm just tryna get home
"Get out the fucking car with your license and registration"
I ain't getting outta shit, you're starting to try my patience
Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike
Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped
Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit

All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull ‘em like a tutor, in fact
A dead one in the front, dead cop in the back
And two live bitches screaming "Odd Future is back"
Aw, nigga thought he killed me?
Alright, that's cool, we'll see

Strict top of the crop shit
Crushin' muthafuckas like moths in a mosh pit
Dollar cents since shit, sense I ain't lost it
It's in a fuckin' jar with guitar picks and bar spit
Bar spat, past tense, warriors of radness
Fuck lame, get it through your brain like dad's dick
Go ahead, stab a friend, tell him that I'm back, bitch
Earl leave bastards with milkiest asses
Take a firm standin', nine on the tracklist
Earl half the reason the reviews fantastic
Niggas gettin' comfy on the couch, I ain't havin' it
Kickin' gluteus maximus, killin' niggas on accident

Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, off 'em!

Off 'em, no off days, no debates, bitch
Box logo, switchblade and cocaine
In my back pocket, take Jade on vacation
The hotel switch from Heartbreak to Bates quick
Rippin' out braids with bare hands amazes
The crowd, go crazy, hands raised, I'm laced with
Swag by the eighth in case you wanna taste it
Faggots wear Prada, Satan wears RMK shit
Hell's angel, crack Christ 'cross the face
With erasers and use Based God as his replacement
Super Saiyan with ruthless slayings
Eat puss, sweet puss got my tooth decayin'

Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, off 'em!

Now pan the cameras back to me and Pamela's
Amateur threesome with Hannah Montana's manager
And Miley feedin' me sandwiches for my stamina
And Santa's in the back laughin' cause my back's crampin' up
Mrs. Claus trippin' balls, think she had enough
And by enough I mean we dope as fuck, she had a gram of us
Flyer than your man because I'm lampin' up
At the airport smokin' hash with all the fuckin' baggage handlers
Flowin' like the muthafuckin' aqueducts
Odd Future Wolf Gang, fag damagers, bitch, eat a dick
Get your lady, cop piff
Inhale and cough, rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick and playing cautious

I'mma show you how it's done right, nigga
Drop this when the sunlight gone
Better run right home when the sky turn black
Screaming "Fuck five-0" 'til my line go flat
In a ash-gray beamer, we'll be callin' that the pigeon coupe
Jackknife bitches to the couches in they living rooms
Ask who the best and I doubt that they picking you
Back like how I need to style, I invented you, yup
Act like you don't know the name
Only time I ain't eating when the cho-cha stanky
Listening to "Pre," getting throat while I lane switch
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pinky
The poster child, you're 'posed to hate me
Bold and wild, you broke and angry, my nigga
Name getting bigger than the difference between us
Niggas is fake, I limit the features I give 'em
Sweat (sweat) shirt (shirt)
You know you famous when the niggas that surround you switch
And if they hated in a passive tense
And now they hound your dick, and you ain't ask for this
Now you surrounded with a gaggle of 100 fucking thousand kids
Who you can't get mad at, when they want a pound and pic
Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick
And they the reason that the paper in your trouser's thick
I said sweat (sweat) shirt (shirt)
You can tell the Reaper I'mma meet 'em when he send for me
With a cleaver and  a .30, and some twisted weed
I pick one, and let the crimson leak, nigga

Get your lady, cop piff
Inhale and cough, rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick and playing cautious

You used to say you like violins and your lifestyle depend on me
And I know it's nighttime when you get lonely
And tell all your little friends how that bitch stole me
And despite all of the facts that you got phony
You gon' tell them about the night that you exposed me
For the bastard I was, and how I probably smashed every bitch
That I passed in the club, and the last couple months
Was the worst, cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months that we had as a couple
My absence of fucks was a problem that we ain't ever
Really get to solve, we just smashed and we scuffled
Tryna keep it calm but I snap at you
Now you're taking all your property back and it's obvious that
That apart from the fact that we fuck
And it's bomb, and I hate when you home
And I, and when I'm gone I don't call cause you nag
Man, I brought you the shit and I bought you some shit
What you offering here?
"What the fuck you offering here?"

Get your lady, cop piff
Inhale and cough, rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick and playing cautious
Chef Sweaty braising your faculty
Face getting gray from the ash, but I'm laughing
That's the trace in me, nigga
Fuck out my face while I'm thinking
Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute
My days numbered
I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em
I feel like I'm the only one pressin' to grow upwards
It's still fuck you and whoever you showed up with
Trying to see an M and some steadier hands
Who you callin' your mans?
Bet you thought he was solid, when he really just sand
Washing away with the water
I'm a land mammal staying away from the altar
Shit changed in the August, in the wake of that August
Last autumn the leaves fell, and I raked in the profit
Disobeying the doctor
The good guy prescribe, faith never caught 'em
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in a faucet

And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me

Solid, so the funds don't phase me
On tour wildin' by the truck stop racists
Hard as finding me a, a common thread between us
Raised different, my momma, she born, bred the leader
To get shit poppin' like the gun's off safety
Sayin' easy and doing harder when you get caught up
Raised neck and neck with Nak, so I’m a fluent brawler
Rain checkin’ on ya plot if ever bread should pop up
Out the toaster I gotta focus, my family problems
Shrunk and widen with the bumps in my personal finance
It hurt 'cause I can’t keep a date or put personal time in
Or reverse to the times when my face didn’t surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Can’t put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket
Shit in a pile, never change, I’m stupid for tryin’
Still just too busy wildin’ (still)

And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
Intercepting a fifth of whisky and necking it 'til I'm dizzy
I never was defenseless, I never hugged the fence
I pick a side and trust in it, stomach full of drugs and shit
My niggas on some other, Cleanse Sunday, binge Monday
Then another six days, back to Sunday when it's done again (Shit)

And the pants better be creased on my corpse
If you need that, run until the street lights off
Back got bigger, got the team strapped on
And you thought it was magic but that's just the difference
Nigga, my team is magicians
We think of the shit that we want then we get it
Look I got hoes in my britches
Big Up Dill & Britches, full part coming soon
Thought you knew this my nigga, it's crackin' like french tips
Just checking and balancing
Checks and the salaries testing my friendships
Cause niggas get sour of this
Rap shit got the best of me, I threw the rest off the balcony
Shout out Da$H and RetcHy, I know yo' bitch check for me
So much for chivalry, so long to every bitch tryna get intimate
I'm in my 20's now
Feet aimed at the jaws of the running mouth
Disdain for the law since a fucking child
Spotlights on me, I ain't stopping in my tracks
We taking it all then we running out
Threw shade in the past, but you love me now, huh?
Put your face in your palm when I come around ya
Tell momma get a gun if I get too popular
I'm just being honest with her
Tell her stop whining, it ain't no more problems
I'm the best out of all these niggas
Watch your tone when you speaking (yeah)
Ain't no home for the weak and
No rest for your ass if I know that you're sleeping
I'm here and I'm there and I'm up and I'm down
And I'm low and I'm peakin' (Yup)
It's cold in the deep end (Yup)
(I'm low and I'm creeping)

Bitch nigga, we the train, if you see 'em wave
Ain't no bitch in my DNA, aye
Bitch nigga, we the train, if you see 'em wave
Ain't no bitch in my DNA, hey

Hundred blunts, niggas change, that's my day to day
Niggas tryna ride my train like they fucking strays
My bro left today, fuck
Hot sauce in my cup of noodles; you taught me that
I ain't seen you in some years and this news right here
Almost made me have a heart attack
Your mama heart intact; we just spoke, I couldn't stomach that
I'm going to London on the first, I'm bringin you somethin back
A house on the hill with a big ass grill
Where we could have a boxing match
Japan, Australia, I know you be proud of that
I got a couple bitches now, I ain't gotta lie 'bout that
I know you in a better place; I can't even cry about that
When I look into the clouds, I know you look down on me
Right next to grandmammy
And the rest of the ones who wanna see me happy
Look for me, lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality
High up until the world ends, doing eighty-five in my ride
And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant
I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him I'm a diamond
I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro
Chilling with a vixen, thinking "This is what I did it for"
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
Still trifling, Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho

Doms, Doms
Doms

While they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit
I'm shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New patterns patty-caking with mannequins
Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all
Jaw-slacking, all 'em awe struck
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs
And that's, prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit?
And can a real nigga get a look at it? Crook, panic-shook
Ain't ya? Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Cheffing, fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy, running 'til my foot aching
Full-grown terror type, Ferragamo do-rag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans
Smoking 'till I'm loopy as a motherfucking toucan
20 minutes, burn a fucking quarter back to two grams
But I'mma dip, I know you must have had it with my rude ass
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Soon as I catch the vibe tell 'em to fetch the hearse
Shorty I’m pressin' lines lifting the Lauren shirt
Tell her to bless the girth if she with it
I’m in that kitchen, wrist water whippin' work
(Psych!) Nigga, I don’t do that
Niggas get bloop-blapped and blown away
Wessons making Mexicans wetbacks like "Órale!"
Okay, I’m on to something
Momma should've told you it’d be days like this
It’s just a tale from the crip
I’m on my séance shit, I’m tryna' make a million dollars
Keep it hood while crossing over on some A.I. shit
I need a foreign baby momma to match a nigga model whip
Ramona Park made me from scratch, a lot of lotto picks lost
Inside this game we call rap, I be the underdog
Bullet hit his forehead, it exit out his under arm
Ain’t nobody bigger than my hood, my nigga, fuck a boss
Baby momma killer, you offended and I fuck her raw
Stretchy doin' federal time for bustin' at the law
And he gonna be a neighbor of mine, you play me for a pawn
Shorty I be swimmin' with sharks, your posse full of prawns
Pistols rip his body apart, now he afraid of dark alleyways
Niggas better listen when the pastor say

It's Golf on that—bitch, it's Golf on that ball cap
I guzzle the tall boy, Jehovah ain’t call back
And ya’ll still debating over Earl music
Troops got the group nationwide moving merch units crazy
Peanut butter to paisley, walking down the street
In the different color McGradys, that first grader was me
Now my fist full of spliffs and the old banker receipts
Bitches grip the stick and jerky like cold shanks of the beef, dry
I’m taking purses like they chances in the evening
Pick your pants up, boy, you dancing with a demon
On my mama I been limiting my features, filling swishers up with reefer
Bitch, it's difficult to beat him like a soft dick
Golf clique deep and we don't hit the streets passive
That nigga Sweaty got the gas and Shreddy K brought the matches
Put your body down in water like a Lipton tea bag and then
Switch to a different fuckin whip to let them piggies speed past 'em
It's the rats, try and get the cheese
What it do? Rap like I'm mincing meat
Call me Lou, if I'm on the track, these niggas skip to me
Niggas want to fade me, bitches feel some type of way for me
50s in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth
Vince be with the rocket, he gon pop it when it’s danger round
Fingertips to tapers now, salute us when you face us
Give a fuck about the moves all these loser niggas making now
Gorgeous chrome-plated horse whip
Home-making paintings for poor-quality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy
Sack swinging like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good lord, walk light like the floor slick
Look bored, hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion endorsing his own importance
Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating crisp spit
Fist clinched emulating '68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle aged and limp-sticked
Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliff's lit
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium
Heavy as insurance off a spanking new laser gun
Crazy heart, hazy lung, making art, raking funds
Crowd going dumb like Palin's son

And it always follows Autumn
No home for the weak
No insurance for your pride
Jive, nigga
And it always follows Autumn

I sit in thought 'til the flow is right
Then throw some D on all available open mics
Smoke it right proposing these niggas over
Wipe more because I normally toilet bowl with a broken pipe
Shit, the former soloist who flow was sick
The token sober kid stressed so the role was switched
Now Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff
Look who’s as useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit
Nigga cold is what you need to keep the poultry in
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks
Early man, you posers know me as the troll throwing moldy
Donut holes at your grody ho from his cronies' whip
Eating like the kids when you take ‘em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over
Tracks damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is, missiles to the picket fence
Who spit as good fingerlickin’ bitch
Bet it's thirty-six fish netted like the hook was inefficient
Welcome back to class, bitch, grab on to your glasses
Odd Future leaving even niggas in past tense
Style is patent, the measures is drastic
Either that or they 4:4, some call them fantastic
She called me fantastic, I called her a fat bitch
Still kill the pussy, put the cat in a casket
The funeral service was fucking worthless, so I said a couple words at it
Didn't know her but I'm confirming that she sure gurgled dick
The Odd nigga with a spoon in your Danimals
As hungry as a cannibal, trapped in a van of cantaloupes
Harder than granite, hoes know I'm coming
With the grand force of Van Damme's fist in a damn cannon, so
Fans catch us on Animal Planet, tracking hoes
And attacking faster than foes can change the channel, whoa
My dick hates sweaters so she jack it slow
The aftermath proves to be smoother than hair relaxer, no

Wave high to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the Letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent
Say hi to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the Letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent

Took the van, went snatch her
Oh, you wanna snap and scratch? Snap your fucking jabber
Wocky, she's a dancer, walkie-talkie Ace for back up
Like, "Fag, I got class and can't take this bitch to math, what
Tell the fucking teacher that this burlap sack is filled
With snacks for after class for the whole class to snack up?
Yeah, right, get over here faster
Cause Earl's a pro rapper but amateur kidnapper"

Earl, goddammit, I'm still in my damn pajamas
Waiting on mom to bring me the Aspirin from a trampoline jump
And if I pick her up, I'm humping and I'm fucking with no lubricant
I'm using spit, piss, vaseline or something, how old is she?
(Seventeen) This bitch is underage
But I'll have her face off tied and Nicholas caged
But anyway, give me cash fag, cause I'm low on gas
Aww fuck it, about to jack off, go catch a fucking cab
No I'm not lying when I say that brother's all I have
But if you're not dying don't fucking bother to call me back
I'm sleep... 

Say hi to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the Letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent

Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Odd Future here to steer you to what the fuck's cool
Fuck rules, skate life, rape, write, repeat twice
Odd Future young enough to get your priest mouth drool
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Odd Future here to steer you to what the fuck's cool
Fuck rules, skate life, rape, write, repeat twice
Odd Future young enough to get your priest mouth drool

I don't give a fuck, like a senior citizen
Shit and run back to the lab, need assistance from
Sister with the biggest bumbaclot girls
I'm around calves big cause they run a lot and scream, oh
Pay him some attention, he's smart and he's genius
He ain't touching me like Martin Sheen's penis
Y'all niggas ain't clean as my team is mean as
Hitting amputees in the knees, Jesus
Please, just peep the Crystal Method where
I take a fucking beat, strip it naked then I wreck it
It's no question, Sweatshirt's OF
And you can tell by the chiseled horns on my forehead bitch
Hammer-hat flyer than a bag of bats
And Jade's a fucking acrobat, I'll flip her on a mattress
Last straw, fuck that, I'm who broke the camel's back
Say you want that dope shit, welcome to Satan's cabbage patch, bitch

Told you he can rap, dumb mothafucka
Foot and hand on the gates
We was jumping 'em, fuck, I'm like quicksand in my ways
Was always stuck in 'em, stuck it in and I ambulance came
The first time which ain't fast if you Los Angeles raised (nigga)
My bitch say the spliff take the soul from me (aye)
And the clique tight-knit, it's like the 'lo rugby
Beat the fucking beat up like it stole from me (yup)
You can talk to Clancy, you need a feature or quote from me (Bitch) I'm off Delancey, I reek of reefer and show money
It's Early running with niggas who cold running shit
The wins like lotion, he get 'em, he gone rub 'em in
Critics pretend to get it and bitches just don't fuck with him
I spent the day drinking and missing my grandmother, just
Grab a glass and pour some cold white wine in it
A Colt .45 in it, you know how I get it
I'm toasting myself and a toast to all my niggas
And ain't no time limit, I'm toasted as hell
And I gotta jot it quick cause I can't focus so well

And now, a formal introduction
Guess with a few exceptions, yeah, I'm living honest
Except I promised my momma that I would finish college, started chasing profit
Sorry ma, I ain't forget about it but if money evil
I'm hoping that you could see through all the drama and watch me get these dollars
And my ambition burn so hot, it's like I'm bleeding lava
Haters be pleading me to stop but I don't even bother
Though my approach is seeming awkward, I could see it proper
See success and I just see the fact that I don't need a father
Doms hotter than the drop of Harry Potter shit
Pedal to the metal, high-level, full throttle shit
Still searching for a reason why niggas ain't acknowledge this
I'm lost in an era where real shit does not exist
I need the sway of things, I'm everyday cooling it
I'm getting blazed and laughing at the way they overdoing shit
I'm just a old soul sticking to a newer script
I guess I got to prove this shit, I'm truly too legit to quit

I'd like to send a shout to the fathers that didn't raise us
To every hoe who hated, now unable to say much
To critics doing dirty with comments, a nigga paid for an apartment
Yesterday off some songs I haven't yet made up
Black Cressida, pay up
Bars going hard as the ashtray where I place guts
Shouts to the eses who paid pesos to play us, riding in the barrio
Huff and puff blowing kush in Huf clothing articles
Kenny rolling blunts got us stuck like a barnacle
To the bottom of your shit, ironic cause the audios
As nautical as ships, look momma, look momma
Look, your product is legit, I promise, honest
This karma got me balling up my fist
'Til I demolish your clique, pardon the clips
I am honestly as bomb as it gets
Regardless of who is talking, I'm farming, harvesting hits
Just me and Domo, one lit, marijuana to split between two of us
Rocking boxes easy as warming some ramen noodles up
So, searching for a way to state it right
Young, black, and jaded, vision hazy strolling through the night
(Cough)
Fuck... Yo, I gotta stop smoking backwoods

"How you doing?" And what's your motive, ho?
I only trust these bitches bout as far as I can throw 'em
Trying to pay my momma rent, figure that's just what I owe her
I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller
Strollin', easy down this narrow path, beefin' with your scary ass
'Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad
And nigga, that's a great lunch
Poppa swamp and stomping with the skate fucks
Heavy handing tracks until the day the fucking train come
Raised up where every mouth that speak the truth get taped shut
Peep the evening news, my nigga, we don't do the same stuff
Kiwis couldn't take us, boy, I'm jogging around these bases
Niggas pitches need to change, I separated from my main one
It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face fuck
I been like this since the Motorola Razr
What a bastard that baby was
Little mad nigga missing dad, never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me
I got this nigga Da$h with me, he sipping on some maple leaf
I'm only happy when there's static in the air
Cause the fair weather fake to me
Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets
Dare a nigga think it's sweet, never, bitches funny boy
You berries and you honey for the bear that's here to tear and eat
Run a niggas pockets like some errands, make it hasty
I hope the sheriff keep away from me
Hope the sheriff keep away from me
Hope the sheriff keep away from me
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before

Late for everything, my face to the cement
That's how I always seen it
I spent days faded and anemic
You could see it in my face, I ain't been eatin', I'm just wastin' away
Looks like the way that River Phoenix went gon' end up my fate
And when they drag me out the gutter, mail the ashes to my mother
Twist the spliff if I don't finish my plate
Slip a fist up for my niggas in chains, my mental was caged
See, I ain't been to prison but the feeling's the same
Shared sentiment, winnin' if the pen hit the page
As of late, I've been watchin' every bitch in my space
Shit's just lookin' different with age
Try to make some sense of all this shit in my brain
One foot stuck in a tar pit of my ways

And if it's like that the whole time...
If it's like that the whole time, we'll be alright
And if it's like that the whole time, we'll be alright
Stayin' up all night, but it's alright
And I been stayin' up the whole night, but it's alright

It's me and my nibbling conscience
Nigga, I'm fixin' to give up
I've been alone for the longest
It's trouble, the way that we joggin'
Nothin' gon' save us or stop us
Me and my nibbling conscience
Nigga, I'm fixin' to give up
I've been alone for the longest
This spliff, I ain't splittin' no time soon
My brain split in two, it's rainin' a bit
I hope it's a monsoon, my face in the sink
I'm seein' my mom soon, I'm faded, I stink
Stay in it, alright..? (faded, I'm stayin' in...)



I got my grandmama's hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most cause I feel defeated
And I buy nothin' by myself, my second thoughts, my sec...
(and I buy nothin' by myself)
My hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most cause I feel defeated
And I buy nothin' but myself, my second thoughts
My hectic process of thinkin' and all my doubts, and I think
I know Nak in there sleepin', he on the couch, that's my brother
Give me a boost when my confidence need it, so I love him
To tell the truth, I got a problem with eatin', I be druggin'
To tell the truth, I'm not supposed to be off in here
I'm supposed to be sleepin', but I be turnin' and tossin'
To tell the truth, I miss my partna dem
To tell the truth, you can't be loud when you're the wrongest, fam
To tell the truth, I'm at a loss of friends
Well time waits for no man and death waits with cold hands
I'm the youngest old man that you know
If ya soul intact, let me know
Nineteen, still gettin' kicked out the crib
Ripped off my bib, spit out my food, hiccup and piss
Urine burnin', I could smell the liquor in this
Cats always tryna' pick up the fist—"Duff this dude out"
Rappers stoop just to get to your crib
Now it's like bruised face, loose walk, too sauced
Distraught thoughts on my corpse on the asphalt
Back when I’d slack off, rock my slacks of my ass half-off
Every time I rap I blast-off
Back when I catch court I always had sports
Dippin' on cops in my track shorts
So tell my mom I had to make it right
I lie every night about the lime-light so I could lie at night
And tell my pops I gotta take advice
Keep my head screwed on tight, abuse these mics
See me, I’m the contusion type
A cat to smack the mic
Against my fuckin' head when I'm losing hype
RATKING, never losing hype, no
Smack king and I do it right, no
RATKING, yeah, I do it nice, woah

Bitch, I skated before I rapped
If you take me before your captain, bet 20 hots on your daddy
That someone could Noila Clap 'em, probably cold and passive
Cause pops was the one that got to me, feeling down like he passed it
And when I'm cornered, it's action, I was kinda out the game
Momma put the quarter right back in the slot
In '09, we took the 7 to the Dussy 17 to the block
Bitch, if yo' nigga had Supreme, we was the reason he copped it
And nowadays I'm on the hunt for mirrors to box with
And some pretty bitches that ain't trip if it's a hit and run
I got the gold cause I don't do the crying, bro
She Mario, I'm tryna keep the whining to a minimum
Piggies come, bet I'm splittin' quicker than I finish rum
Find me some Indica, nuggets on my fingers
And my shirt like they was chicken crumbs
The room spinnin', finna yak if I don't hit the blunt
Got the chin waggin', slim chances of me getting up
After this, mind in the trash next to where my fuckin' passion went
Dodge fanatics, half-a-Xanax when I'm traveling
Six hours or more, brick out on the tour
Got kicked out of the morgue, spit cattle manure shit
Shit, rally the Horsemen, tally the corpses
I don't give a fuck, nigga
So why'd they evict you, bro?

Feel this cage when that acid fade
Face the same, but your mind has changed
You desire a stable home, I acquire fame at naming hoes
Contemplating ways of getting dome, plotting on my neighbors
Asking God for favors, guess he isn’t home
Probably 'cause that fucking faith I didn't show
Skipping church, flip the work
Hit the dirt like Tommy Drummond, bitch
Grew up in a home that papa wasn’t in
Came up off of work that my conscience wasn't in
Either way it goes, a lot is getting hit
And if it wasn’t hoes, then it probably was a lick
Got burners on my soul, and my posse on my skin
Sweaty, D-A-Dolla, top lotto picks
Promise that I'm not the one to fucking plot against
Love him, but my father ain't my motherfucking friend
Trying to figure out how to start a motherfucking end
Huh, trend dodging, keep a bitch by me, bank roll
Garbage bag full of sins, cleanse my soul to rap still, nigga
Cash is in hand, packs get vac sealed, like the Tin Man
Cardiac still missing, is it past real, get it, work, make Guinness

Don't know where I'm going, don't know where I been
Never trust these hoes, can't even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up, you fucking with some grown ups
Don't know where I'm going, don't know where I been
Never trust these hoes, can't even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up, you fucking with some grown ups

My mama wonder why I never seem to reach her
See my daddy in the way I'm acting and my facial features
Just trying to put you on, dawg, I came from teachers
Take the plate and clean it, nigga, I'm a dog
Tell her "hit or miss me with the fucking monologue"
Lord, I can't fight it, know I'm tryna brawl
Get a copper hauled off, shit
I'm the type of nigga that you cop your raw off
Popping whores off
Grab the ball and these niggas call charge
Team switching jerseys like it's All Star
Press the OnStar, think we all lost
Juicebox, tank top, tube socks
Dude stop, forehead shiny like a new Glock
Two shots fired at the Excursion we were swervin' in
All-purpose verses with a passion for servin' kids
Empty out your purses on an immature crime spree
Eyin' up the nurses with some gloves that read "I squeeze"
Who the fuck said to speak, Mr. Me-Is-Siamese?
Even Christ said "Christ, he flows quite nicely"
Hypebeast's highly likely to bite me
And try to high five me, but I just give them high threes
Cause y'all don't get two, touch me, I'm the shit
Sue me, if you got an issue, grab a tissue
Mediocrity is odd to me
Ass as far as ya eyes can see. Who the best? They holla me
Nombre, Ho-lay shit, I don't spit crack, I spit cocaine crisp
I ain't fuckin' with it if it's no payment
'Cause everyone knows paid dues don't pay rent
I'm dope like the coke that I'm laced with
Dreams what I'm chasin', flow hot it's chafin'
This is why I'm hot? No, that is why I'm blazin'
Dilla jacked Nick, I am shinin' like the diamond that I'm draped in
But I don't wear jewelery, it's HUF over Louis V
Excuse the endurance miss, this critic thing is new to me
Yeah man, you know what I’m saying?
Already
You crazy for this one!

Fresh out the belly of the island into the heart of the city
T and them just hit the road, I had Sage and Nak and 'em with me
I thought the fauna was pretty so I approached her (I did)
My first apartment was really covered with roaches
Cause niggas was really smoking
Gotta say that as of late I been busy with business mostly
Got a tape? Catch a wave, now you in the industry ocean
Missing out on your boat
I been figuring out my own fish, home gets distant
We working, I'm on the road again
Cold and the spirits is bursting up out the Trojan, man
Fridge full of spirits in the crib, mirror, mirror
Let me hear why the niggas that's the peers see and hear us
Then mimic the fucking motions, man
Keep the circle close, let them niggas front in the cul-de-sacs
Friendly with the chosen, the rest is getting the poker hand
Face-drinking smoker, it help me duck when emotion jab
Fame is the culprit who give me drugs without owing cash
Sipping 'til I melt
Devil trying me, I'm dodging, falling victim to myself
Middle finger to the help
When it's problems, I don't holler, rather fix 'em on myself
When it's looking like it's quiet for you, this the shit to yell
This the shit, right, yup, keep your chin high up
Cause when she ain't fucking with you then her friend might
Let you get up inside, yup, let this shit ride, yup
You don't get it rocking like we do on this side, nigga

I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper
And lately, I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily
It's Earl, Mr. Early Bird, gets them girls with curvy curves
Skate Mental, truck smack a faggot in his Shirley Temple
Your rhymes rentals, give 'em back to they owners
At the end of the bar, I spit with the permanence
Learn I'm a curb stomping person
Like third strike verdict dropping jaw dropping verses
This bigger lips in person, nigga spits some burn so urn the shit
Furnish the flow until my pockets green, Kermit's dick
The Miss Piggies with a string in they ass
I control them like your eyes when I'm tinking a glass
So if you thinking about dissing stop thinking it fast
Cause my wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, ho
The Miss Piggies with a string in they ass
I control them like your eyes when I'm tinking a glass
So if you thinking about dissing, stop thinking it fast
Cause my wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, bitch

Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migraine
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains
Wait, where you going, what you doing tonight?
Just want to know what you doing, come back
Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migraine
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains
Where you going, what you doing tonight?
Stop running, where you going, what you doing?

It's Earl, Mr. Lateshift, rapist in training
Who edge about as straight as some clay closet gay dick
Ray say hey Earl's a real charming racist
Your birthday day, have some KK cake bitch
Habit have it, grab it fast and attack it, faggot
I'm above average like I'm rapping in the attic, yeah
I'm crouched in the basement shouting "Couch" is the greatest hit
Dirty as a anus is, fans stand in rain for this
They even stand in sleet season until they fucking feet bleeding
Hail and fucking snow, in hell with fucking coats
Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt
He make them bow down until they mothafucking necks hurt
Fans proud to stand in sleet season until they fucking feet bleeding
Hail and fucking snow, in hell with fucking coats
Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt
He make them bow down 'til they mothafucking necks hurt

Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migraine
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains
Wait, where you going, what you doing tonight?
Just want to know what you doing, come back
Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migraine
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains
Where you going, what you doing tonight?
Stop running, where you going, what you doing?

Mr. Deerskin Moccasins is on the fucking stalk again
Following and stalking all them larchmont soccer chicks
Chopping limbs, gnawing legs, through they fuckin' stockings
Him is grandfather sweatshirt, clockin' all them cardigans
Product of popped rubbers and pops that did not love us
So when I leave home keep my heart on the top cupboard
So I will not stutter when I'm shoutin' fuck you, son
Wolf Gang 'bout it, we ain't waitin' 'til the moon come
Woo son, the moonshine got feelin' loose
As the puss of a whore who's used to abuse
My screws pretty loose mind fucked like the hair-doos
Of doo-doo mamas, dude I will bear jew you
You unripe fruit dudes is crews to chew through
My niggas wash 'em down with a fat carton of yoo-hoo
Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All fuck 'em all
No lube, it's the crew to get use to, faggot
Self-loathing narcissist
Spittin' crowbars out the back window of cars and shit
And acting like a klonopin binge, hardening
And switching up the moniker of artists into arsonists
Knock-knock, it's that prodigal pen-throttle, bitch
Popping like the top of a bottle of hot JavaScript
Rhyme harder than nine joggers with
Shin splints dodging an ornery rhinoceros
Order me my waffles and bother me not, blogger
The option of being modest just walked to where my father went
Ponder how we can holler then spit darker
Than Gotham at six bars in the genre then lick shots
At imposters and miss nada, Volatile pig brawler
Is hotter than lit parliament singeing your fucking arm
In the parking lot of a Target, I'm targeted, piss-harboring
Heart dark as that thick parka I slip markers in
Holla if you've never been a starter
Spartan kicking jocks and tossing salt at their Ed Hardy shit
Burning chops, talking shit, rocking 28's on a rocket ship
So I could give a fuck about the car you in, nigga
Drool and chew aluminum
Blue 'Preme overalls, jump when the Goombas come
From where you should run, from where the shooters come
Out for cheese with a studio, it's like a gouda run, it glues to us
Shouts to pigeons that I flew amongst
Mouth deliver poop, it's spouting mucus from its stupid tongue
Alpha male, got the chickens looser than his cruising trucks
Losers get a Kuma Punch, keep it moving like a puma's lunch (Thanks James)
And I'm... back
Bye
Started thinking about a normal life, it got me suicidal
Standing in the kitchen with a noose and a rifle
Hang or bang hocking loogies in a bible
Dancing with the devil tonight's our first recital
His hands on my hips he take control of my movement
A couple of minutes pass and I don't know what I'm doing
Just dance to the music so nobody will laugh at me
But the fucking voices in my head keep asking me
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?

I live all over my roomie's a bum
Fuck a bitch never sober virgin bitch nun
Sound like she dying when that virgin bitch cum
My used penis beats on this virgin bitch drums
She asking me to dance I ask for my pants
Ended up with an argument sirens, ambulance
Scratch her off my list, the situation bias
She made me a milkshake and forced me to try it
Nah I ain't Nas get the fuck off my dick
Besides from the smell of it I'm hating the flavor
Last night for the hell of it I raped her neighbor
Bit her fillings all through my vampire teeth saber
(Ahh, Jesus, please) She screams for her savior
A nun with a bum fuck you bitch better pay up
I need to eat, place to sleep, new shoes, aging feet
Alligator hair heat Gatorade made her sweet

Bitter sweet seven fist fighting with a reverend
Bless sessions niggas fresh as Crest breath is
Devil in my chest I inhale more cess then
Place one missed call to heaven
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
Salmon skin Band-Aid help with recovery
Diction buttery, grass depending
Your nigga was switching passed depending on where the rudder swings
Snapping like the shutter speed, pucker up, kiss of death
Tell your men to hit the deck or hit the dirt
Killing who you send in first, verse wintergreen spit it, show 'em that I meant it
Ho, I'm rolling with my niggas, find a gold and call the chemist
Show up solo to the scrimmage, throw a brick and pour the Henny
Don't defend it, it's useless nigga
Up to my wrist in the cooler gripping the brew in this music shit
For Versace suicidal, I hit the Jake, threw the rifle
And tell her open that mouth for deposit, leave the bank broke
Sliding in, she smiling and fidgeting, pull my face close
Streaming down the street from what 'roma was stank though
Product of the villainy,  product capable, plainclothes
Rhyme with no niggas who probably was gonna remain broke
Uhh, let's be honest, 'cause truthfully
At the rate I'm moving, you gon' have to get used to me
This sauce is the weakest, tang and my three step
Often rejected cause I reject the reject
Garage band flow needs no reasoning
Y'all niggas tasteless, beef no seasoning
C4's eating them proceed to the exit
Ends with a L-Y, starts with an S, yes
Him without a win is Clark Kent without a cleft chin
Superman reference of how high I keep stepping
Whoa, I go harder than standardized testing
Bars on lock my development's arrested
I'm the bestest, on a bad day I spit asbestos
Yeah, yes, impressive y'all steady coming in second
Fuck V-necks, I'm the rapper to invest in
My flow ends recessions, I'm fresh as Crest breath is
Okay, I'm tryna tell you I'm superior
Cardiac flow what you're hearing in my material is heart
Covered in ego, I freeze MCs zero degrees below
When it's comes to alter-ego's, I got at least four
But they the reason why I'm always ready, listo
Aight I'm Sly-lingual, eyes on the prize, I'm fly make eyes twinkle
I been dope, put it on your grandmother's wrinkles
Chip on my shoulder like I'm dieting with Pringles
I brush it off quick like H to the O-V
Life is but a beach chair beach nigga's folding
This my little brother on my mother's side, our father died
He was living with my grandmother on the North side
Of Sacramento, but this fag ain't just visiting
He's settling in, he can't wait to start meddling
And doing the evil shit we do (Does he skate?)
Yeah he skate too (Man, thisniggaugly) and he raps, ooh
This the newest Wolf Gang member and he
(What's his name?) Earl

Nigga, this nigga's forehead is so fuckin' big
This nigga, look at this fuckin' nigga lips, dog
This nigga's lips look like a split sundae
Yo this nigga's line is bended, that's fucked up
Yo this nigga, this nigga look like a African poet
Earl, say somethin'
Yo this nigga's forehead looks like a fuckin' big-ass moose
Nigga, don't be nervous nigga, say somethin'; trust me guys, he can rap
He a bitch, just say somethin'
Nigga, don't be a bitch nigga, say somethin'
Nigga, rap, you fuckin' suck probably
Trust me guys, he can rap, just say somethin'

I've been tryna tell a different story
Find balance and I'm tippin' off
And tell grandma I be with her shortly
I won't panic when they send her for me
Cause I ain't got time for feelin' sorry
I gotta be on point when duty call
And I'm prolly the worst nigga to get involved with
These shoulders is not for you to sniffle on

Watch the wall collide with my fist
Mostly over problems that I know I should fix
Focused so I know my skin tone is a cliff
We on the edge and they hopin' we slip
I had to ask moms what I owed to this shit, she said "Nothin'"
She asked me 'bout them old times both of us miss, I said nothin'
She asked me if I'm smokin' again
I told her that I prolly gotta go in a bit

I've been tryna tell a different story
Find balance and I'm tippin' off
And tell grandma I be with her shortly
I won't panic when they send her for me
Cause I ain't got time for feelin' sorry
I gotta be on point when duty call
And I'm prolly the worst nigga to get involved with
These shoulders is not for you to sniffle on
Tunnel vision on a guap stack
Malt liquor perspirating through the brown sack
Big talk looking thinner when it's combat
Swear that shit is astounding
I ain't stupid with cash either, I grew up around it
They overheard he shoot nice so they knew to surround him
Eating shit like he's Shoenice like the booth had a bounty
I'ma kill it, it's Early like a school night
I'm the realest that you know, my bruised soul
In the middle of group home in the locks
Threw the times I spent off in group homes in a box
I been grown boy
And cool coals you spitting just ain't hot, this fire and brimstone
You guys should've went home when you could've
Took the title, raising bars of what's supposed to be good up
His shirt drenched, they wet his rosary wood up
And who you 'posed to be, sugar
Don't get close to me
My heart cold like the fucking carrots in the grocery store
And in the morning no Folgers, just 'dro
I told my momma that I'm on my way home
I know my grandma watching over my soul
On some other shit...

Spent nights off the downers at my desk
Did time in the tower off the spliffs
I'm not like the cowards on the fence
I'm not like I'm lounging on the bench
Get up out and get your shit
Find some power in yourself or in this shit
Listen, my niggas spit
All day give 'em what live niggas require
My state give up the prize cause I'ma find it
Anyway boy we riding
Trying to sneak the cake up out the motherfucking bakery quiet
Dodge and evade all the fire
Watch what you saying to sire
Stay out my face and my wallet
Move state to state for the profit
Said that on Sunday, you peeped it
A tiny list of my peoples
I see 'em all as my equal
So the difference between us is a just a pimp and a preacher
I'm running quick from my demons
I crush the spliff with my sneaker
You know the difference between us
These niggas fraud you could see it, all of them out of their feelings
I know my heart so I speak it
I love the squad so I lead it
Eyes wide open, I'm sleepy
I'm on the highway, I'm weaving in and out of my lanes
I call mom say, that I was all the power I needed
She say she glad I'm called she just can't believe it
I'm gone

- I can fix myself breakfast, I'm sixteen
- Earl
- What?
- Earl, wake the fuck up, you faggot!
- How 'bout you shut the fuck up, mom?!
They landed at Plymouth
With a smile on their face

My whole disposition like
Fuck who told me to sit
Ten toes on the cement
Lil weed in my socks
Send dudes songs to repent
Clean up my thoughts
We in a box
See a lot of niggas talk
On the bench
A lotta father figures followin' trends
I ain't involved with 'em
Lemmings like to fall off of cliffs
And bring they squad with 'em
I seen God in the mirror drinking
I tee off when the spirit hit me
And I don't fear the ending
I feel the envy
I listen to my past when it whisper to me
Half of it makes sense
My nigga half of it riddles to me
Moses with a makeshift staff
Sending ripples through ya
And through the land
And the river been a plan
But when I go to grab it, it slither out my hand
So on my other hand
I been handling business
Kinda shabby but my momma told me man up
It's now Popeye with the anchor tats
And the spinach
Finna spazz on a nigga if I have to
Wrist takers, no Satan, new dance moves
It could be your last move
Hard to see the glass half full
When you don't have food
Wrist dangling like black fruit, nigga

Crossing all my T's
And I'm dotting all my I's
Gotta watch out for debris
When it's fallin' down
As far as I can see
I done confronted all the shit
I couldn't walk around
Keep a piece when you on the ground
Leakin', you hard as Hell
Keep some wind in my sails
Walkin' down La Brea
Name ringin' bells like we got some mail

Ahh, still love me
More than feelings get hurt when the shotty goes
Blow, ears get fucked from my audios
I get more ass than potty holes
Had these naughty flows ever since I was a snotty nose
Youngin, mobbin’ with my shirt tucked in
I’ll pop a nigga in his mouth to show him I wasn’t bluffin’
But, things changed like a Barack Campaign ad
Niggas on the sneak tip I see you clearly through these Ray-Bans
Wait, now my erections go "pshh" down the necks of hoes
Who next to go? The flexible bisexual, I’m thinkin’ so
What’s perplexin’, though, is that this adolescent's flow
Is hotter than a motherfuckin’ summer spent in Mexico
Cop me a mic, check and go, prepare for domination
I got more flavors than a calm doctor has patients
Cut to the race, I’ll come in first place
Respect me or catch a Nike SB to the face
Now, I whooped so many niggas that they callin’ me racist
I annihilate them, my flows amazing as grace is
Ask them motherfuckers locked up in my basement
I won’t give a shit, fuck, once your face hit’s the pavement
A hater only flatters me
Who's up to bat? We bastards, we savage, y'all handle more balls than Agassi
No body passes me, Fantastic 3 plus 1
Leave catastrophes wherever we run, umm
Hun, pardon the casualties
Lyrically you can’t pass me
Nigga tryina pass me got slapped like a black chicks ass cheek
I’m cold make the track sneeze, breakin’ niggas like bad knees
I got sweet steeze, so sweet I attract bees
With my, brainiac flows, the zaniest hoes know
I hit niggas playin’ me with low blows
To keep your eyes wide shut like a No-Doz
I cop dough and stay afloat when I show boat, nigga
Yeah, I'm eating shawarma, doing drawings of Chewbacca
Bumping Flocka, fuck the drama
Marijuana been as calming as the fucking Dalai Lama
Your style common as a little league sponsor from retarded kids' fathers
I'm at meetings shaking hands and adding commas to my net worth
Talk about my money, please, some feelings might just get hurt
This the same effect, and less words
Chilling with this asshole who calls himself Sweatshirt (That's me, it's ya boy)
This might be some of my best work (Indeed)
Let these bitches dive in, head first
Applying pressure when I put together letters
I'm a king, I'm a myth, beat a bitch down with my scepter
These hidden treasures feeling better than a million sweaters in Alaska
Your raps are corny as Nebraska
Lacksa-daisical bars, my throwaways will trash ya
High as NASA on acetone, acid foam
Talking trash like John McEnroe
You a little bitch, that's what the fucking Cabbage Patch is for (That's what is for)
Watch me smack a ho, turn around and catapult
Up above my castle's moat, right into my fucking throne (Throne)
They like, "damn, Mac, what the fuck you on? (The fuck you on?)"

Drugs, thugs, killers, goons, saints, evil, wise, fools, highs, lows, bitches, hoes

Hell's chariot creeping
Her exposure's indecent
Roll is similar to bakers' dough, a bun in the oven
Karma couldn't make her save it though
Just playing my music, you see I speak to her endangered soul
God's son, dick in the dirt because the manger broke
Bitch, I really go bumping tonight
Whether wrong or right, we rushing them right
You know it's never been much for a fight
But I don't really wanna be that nigga
I black out, and you don't really wanna see that, nigga
I mapped out my plan the best that I could to get rich, and put on for the rest of my hood
You know it make us think revenge when the recipe cook
Shoot the leader in the head, leave the rest of em' shook
"I rap better than most these rap veterans"
Words so real that they had to be said again
Speak sedatives, set a date and we can set it off
Pray I never let that weapon off

Drugs, thugs, killers, goons, saints, evil, wise, fools, highs, lows, bitches, hoes

Sober for a sec, but I'm done, so I write easier
That weapon make a peppermint out of that white tee
If you coming, then godspeed you, you sonning me
Don't speak to me crooked, I'm stunting
Look at me Ma, it's no hand outs
Sweaty want the dumb cash, I'm done with bus riding
She made the mistake for thinking he gave a fuck 'bout her
Tell him duck down or get drug out the back door
Flow got the mouth doing duties like the Task Force
Doobie and a passport, standing where the path forks
Quick to grab your bitch's wrist and get the shit I ask for
Wang Trashy as bitches and two Garmins, we switching through lanes
Handling business on my side of the line where they ain't having it
You know that sweet talk is cheap
Niggas ain't talking, that's regardless what the docket read
Stop and stare, it's really him
Fresh from out the piggy pen
If I die tonight, then tell my mom I was a pretty bitch
City burning
It's the blackest piece of trash they seen in a RV park
Holla at your guala if ever you feel your weed sparse, nigga
Salty tee off with us just know that T brought villains
My nigga we all itchin' to see you dropped
I don't wanna chop it up never fronted like I'm the nicest
Fame faze him not the slightest, aim stainless at your iris
Take paper out your pocket, as sure as Toyo tires round
That fucking little schisty clown is back in full effect
Little teeny tiny Sweat, he biting bitches by the neck
Got my fucking dick as long as lists of shit I should regret
A little bit depressed that's why the winter fit him best
I guess a little biased to the cold, mix the Ritalin and sess
Because I like the highs and lows and I also like the checks
That I'm siphoning from shows, and triple six the set
The set run it back, tight as Corey Duffel pants
Doing niggas dirty as the motherfucking plunger cap
My main and my ex screaming like it's a habit
Move immune in between 'em because I'm diplomatic
Catch me in your city passive, cleaning up my shitty act
Bitches say them gritty raps be making up for shit he lacking
And them kitty kats that got him missing Jerry's Thomas
Burpin' words that's hotter than the pocket where he carry chronic
Very awesome so spare the comments, I'm bi-coastal
Paid and chugging forties you niggas can keep your wine toasted
You'll still never know

Sly's been first, man
Y'all forever last I'm forever everlastin'
Mashing on the gas bypassing all the has-beens
In that sense I'm that shit in that scents
Inhale it, breathe it, embrace it
Crepes is not as flat as you natives of fake is
So I take this and shine and provide illumination
But niggas stay in the dark and I'm startin' to get impatient
15 is the age of the teenager
Roamin' with a mind full of gold, no pager
A circle of squares is what shaped us
Until it's sussed feel free to hate us
Unchained, untamed, fast lanin', fat chainin'
Throw 'em on a playlist labeled as the greatest
Unleaded premium, large not medium
Say cheese, bitches bodies seize upon meeting us, man

This is what I do, I infect hope
And inspire folk by painting pictures with the better view
My soul is weather proof, my mind can shape shift
Divine greatness runs in bloodlines still ancient
Expansive universes embedded in ours
Reflected in stars, I shine with the breath in my heart
That's why my flows complete, it's flawed
Get raw energy, exposed for the whole globe to see
Yeah you know it's me, I'm back at it again
Elevating the bar, haters will never get in
This is a sacred place, where we embrace creation
Through landscape, shape and painted in a vacant space

They asked us to stop playing so rough outta courtesy
And if I were to stay in my lane, I swerve purposely
I spit fire, burns in the third degree
Every line is turpentine to these herb serpentines
Snakes in the grass, for all you dumbasses
Fairfax bastards, rockin' nerd glasses
I dominate, y'all denominate fractions
I relapse back to spittin' crack like chapped lips
Chasin' pavements 'til the day of amazin' payment
Success is the fragrance on my Bathin' Ape apron
Pull your face up out your anus and face this
Darth invade your playlist, you cannot evade this
Closed case, you're makeshift, I make hits
You make shit, you crave this, this greatness
You can't attain us like bad grades for Asians
I'm grade A list, lick the speaker, you could taste it
Open up the case on 'em
Set his own pace, peeped the rats, wasn't racing with 'em
Made it out the maze, haze with the stanky odor
Simmer down my brain when I can't control it
Nigga, where your chips? You should bet 'em on him
Call the vet he barking, hear him and the mess he started
Nigga, they keep a eye on me, I am not a child artist
I raised the bar and hit a chin-up for a while on it
Life a long ride, my niggas up for it
My bitches down for me cause I stay a buck-fifty
Angel City drought time, why the fuck I'm up fifty
Playing like I'm down five? They can't really fuck with me
Let a nigga sizzle in the pan if he wanna
Los Angeles area annual summer, we burning under it
Learned from taking chances and fumbling
Nigga I was taught to take your rations and guzzle 'em, bitch
Welcome to my home, the place that I hate
The place that I love, the Planet of the Apes
The place that I loathe, the boy minus father
Equals boy minus heart, always testing mama
Mic sessions thrash, life lessons trashed
Nights get cold as the knife that I grab
Zoom to your wife room take her life with a stab
Sure her ass look nice, it'd look nicer in a bag
And slung over shoulder, village slum soldier
Bayonet bloods when my cup runneth over
With sith lord dark side of the force
In the trunk of a Porsche tryna butt fuck Yoda
Shotgun, drop T, Earl flow shogun
Jabbing with a pen while you faggots getting toes done
Hold up, I was four going on grown up
So before you niggas tell me I'm nuts, you better grow some, faggot

Fuck this Christmas
Fuck this Christmas (Nigga fuck Santa Claus)
Fuck this Christmas
Ain't nothing for you (Ain't no gift for you)

Crazy mothafuckas in the North Pole causing ruckus
And the punk nut-crackers couldn't cuff us, how I fuck her
It was quiet how I stepped in, I crept in with my cock out
Now she's having make-out sessions with my weapons
Drunk a fifth of eggnog, stole Santa's reindeer
Joy-rode the North Pole, steering is a bitch so
I hopped out and ask some Jasper elves for some info
Where I can burn some Christmas trees with large amounts of thick snow
I've been acting naughty problem child in attendance
John Ritter said he taught me how to mothafuck a Christmas
Dismissing all the wanting and the presents are forsaken
See if you're the gift from God then I'm the Christmas wrap from Satan


You, bitch you can't get nothing
No more, no more presents, no more cranberry sauce
Bitch you can't get nothing no more
No more fleeces for your caprices and shit
Bitch give me my mothafuckin' presents back, ain't none for you
Alright for real, you gon' have to give me my fucking presents back
Cause those are for my grandma, yeah that thong, that was for my grandma
Give me my presents back, give me my gifts

Hold up, hey now, the beast in me
Is no longer sleeping, it wants to eat MC's
So I let 'em free, let 'em feed peacefully
Until he cease, now a beast must drop feces
But I never let it free fall, I catch it and spit it
I kick shit that blows whole districts into tidbits
With pen in fist, I take tallys, of these scrimmages
Can't call it game, my juego wicked as witches is
The kid spits fuego sicker than syphilis
So sister and brothers grab a shovel start digging this
Matter fact, grab a Nikon and picture this
An icon with no assistance and no assist in this
Reminisce the number one plus twenty three
My days are sunny with steeze sweeter than honey bees
Waters are muddy, I'm cunning running from nothing be
Now I'm fucking muffin mothafuckas ain't touch me

Cover Art:
Uh, uh

Give it till I can't give
I lend a hand if it's needed
But these stabs got me bleeding out my back kid
Uh, keep it on the fumble we could sack shit
Hat trick, we considered Mulligan's for that shit
The proof is in the pudding and the pamphlets
The sewer and the mattress
Stupid nigga you can get it, get it
Only thing certain is these taxes
Burn me when the journey end
Clergymen turn me into ashes
I move surgically
With new sermons for the masses, we too purpose for the scrap
What the verdict read? Is that courtesy of shit circumstances?
The earth is my turf, but the hearse like a magnet
I be outside in some handcuffs, might be outside in the dirt, uh
Gentrifiers got the turf getting hacked up
Late nights thinking 'bout who lied to me first
Graveyard energy
Tied to the job based off principle
My inner jit grinning, but my face all twisted
It's the artist at work
Greyhound tickets and some haze on my Mrs
Know it make no sense, I keep my heart on my shirt
When the rainstorm vicious, spend the day blowing, drinking Tryna harvest the hurt, but it make no difference
Welcome to the end of the show, and I'm your host, Johnny GoodTwinkle
(Fuck outta here nigga, let's go, uh, this the rebellious shit, nigga
Start fires with this one, let's go, yeah you know what I'm talking 'bout)

I'm talking 'bout a revolution, I am Sly, kid ruthless
The booth's no spoof it, I spit it like I'm toothless
Food for the youth, while you niggas just fruit
And lies become truth, I drop shit like pollution
Stop fools quick, no problem, no solution
Your crew could sleep in the freezer, and still wouldn't be cool kids
Cruisin' in the music with the attitude of tool kits
Hammerin' these babbling niggas, respect my two cents
I can give two shits, let alone a dollar
My flows make bros go whoa, hoes say holla
Wack niggas say nada, the best, I'm a synonym
Still my pocket slim like the Olsen twins and 'em
Mr. Quick to Diss 'Em, is dismissing 'em quick in my sentences
Oliver Twist like Charles Dickens' death
Wishing competition, but listen the plot thickens
I'm a stand up nigga, well hell, I'm not sittin'

Never, never fail like, feel me like braille, right?
Tip top, zip-lock flow, bitches air tight
Yeah right, try and unzip it
Nigga poutin' cause he got his bitch stole by big lips
Yeah bitch
Wolf Gang, Sweatshirt, ho

'94 black music, beat a preacher's ass to it
Honor class crack movement, you faggots is ass chewin'
New black Rasputin get these hoes loose
As your back tooth with a Kimbo jab to it
Fuck y'all, they can't handle the fact
That I am not yet a man, I'm manhandlin' tracks
Tell these fags that the lip chapped champion's back
Wolf cack is up the ass of the tabbiest cat
My hands on my sock, I'm Pop, Crackle and Snap
Get it poppin' off, pop a couple Xan in some class
Smoke a little hash with my favorite janitor's ass
And beat my teacher 'til she gives my fuckin' mannequins back, bitch
Pigeon blood'll leave the stool wall shitted up
Shit talk, Myrtle fuck, get your little sister fucked
Shit, I'll hit stripper up to go and pick a different slut
To stick inside them fuckin' pots where we brew them bitches up
Rippin' writtens while my nigga Hodgy splittin' blunts
Eyes hazy with my middle finger up a stripper's cunt
Lights down, lit her up, sherm in my sippy cup
Ice pickin' cripples 'til I get my Tommy Pickle rub
Catch me poppin' pimples, tellin' bitches triple 6 is us
Stabbin' 'em with pencils in their temples 'til my dick erupts
It's really fuckin' simple, slut, Wolf Gang, get with us
Either that or grab a full fist of nuts and lick 'em up
Turn it up, fisticuffs, givin' bitches dick to suck
Let 'em drink the cum out a mothafuckin' paper cup
Whores wider than the horse that I'm sniffin' up
Leave now if you ain't tryna get them titties touched

We the best and I'm provin' it
Competition missin' like the braids of fuckin' Ludacris
Mop duplicates, get socked in the uterus
For steppin' in the section of them Odd Future hooligans
Psych, I'll take your uterine, hula hoop with it
Backslap her with a tube of lubricant
Tape it and take it to Ace's so we can do this shit
Carjack her parents' coupe and take a cruise in it
(?), Youtube the shit
Cut the bullshit what you forgot, (?)
Now you're pouting cause I'm playin' your pussy like it's a tuba, bitch
Too foul, loose bowels, get used to it
So point me to the nearest booth so I can poop in it
Yea I'm your new fetish
Rip through cyphers like rabbits chew lettuce
Young black fresh: Hugh Hef, you said it
Grinding with your girl while you're posted, two steppin' (you said it)
Pen in my right, mic in my left fist
Flow got more bang than two weapons
Undetected I'm the best: no question, who said it?
Couldn't find your style with two fuckin' detectives
Straight to the top please no Prerequi-sites
I'm the shit's that's on ya face like zits
Cocky bastard, disappear when the 3/8 hits
Back and forth pacing, got no patience
Pulse racin' I’m amazin' as grace is, fuck Satan (uhh)
Leave this pussy ass with his face caved in
Face it, this adolescent's presence leaves messes keep stepping
Rep niggas with no rep, ho's separate
Niggas with no breath
Ain't no real kin of me
I'm clever, my endeavor sever several wannabes
I'm chilly, got the girls giddy, my flow silly
Roll with me and your crew ain't nothing but four 50's (Ouch!)
Hadn't noticed, that's a mid-200
Me and my crew, both of them, powered in two tundras
Open up your eyes, witness the boy wonder (open em up!)
Fire flow comparable to two summers
Strike like lightning and I don't need thunder
Yeah, uh, uh, uh

Allen with the picked 'fro, answering the outlet
Alley-ooping all the shit home
Powered up, out for the assist
Don't panic when it get cold, we go at it, hoe
How you want them ribs smoked, family? Uh
Ten toes, know you on your shit already
Big stone, granite in your fist, ball
Standing on the strip
Don't panic when the pig come
Scramble, get the big tall fetti, and then get home
Tell me if, tell me if he wins though
Don't think he said he pro-violence
But it's gon' be your problem if he did though
I lived out the way, ay
Palace where the Crips stay
Silent when the pigs came browsing in his shit
Bang like two mallets, too callous for your bitch taste
I 'member when they had my grandmammy on a drip drink
How much of that gin straight? Could have filled a fish tank
My doggy hit my cell, say he got me off the strength
Ask him, "That's just how it is?" say
"You die and then you live, huh?"
Your heart and then your limbs break
Smack you then I flip bro
What's popping like a hip bone
I told you
These niggas passing, like the Citgo we passing
Niggas know we keep the gas inside the spliff roll
The wind get the ashes in the end bro
We been took your pass and your credentials, uh
Bad apple, they be clashing with my kinfolk
Bad acid did damage to my mental
Shorty right, it took some passes just to get grown
They been called me savage from the get go
Uh
I'll fuck you up, bitch
Yeah, this is stadium rap
Hotter than the last name on my alias Jack Rip
Bad bitch flip our gymnasiums pack
Track itch shit's dope, y'all should slang it in sacks
Shit's selling for ten harder than elephant skin
Benevolent grin, I stay gold, you settle for tin
Wolf Gang Wolf Pack I got weapons of tens
So take a wild guess as to why they letting us in, please
Earl letting the competitor win
Is the equivalent of stepping with stilletos in gyms
It's not happening so while I'm standin' checkin' your chin
Know the flow takes the H out your shins, fin
I'm picky with words
I edit my verses
You bet if I said it, I said it with purpose
I'm just not a regular person
Hard to sympathize with Early
I hug the wall like a mural
Need percocets in plural
Young nigga lost in the world, just spent up all of my euros
I don't have time for you girls, that's why I be with my girl
I give her dick and she gives referrals
All of these hoes, it's just me in a jersey
I'm playing the venue, see that's what my work is
No need to research me, boogeyman is the I.D. for my work
I know that you heard of me
Wait for your sleep then your feet feel a jerk
We on a murder spree
This is a burglary
Taking your soul and the bling off your shirt
Like we rehearsed and the screaming don’t work
We got your mafuckin' dream in a hearse
We make it work
Cut the loose ends
No new friends
So I'm always lonely
Even if he shakes yo' hand
That don't make that man your homie
Maybe cause I'm up right now while all these hoes on me
Maybe cause I'm up right now while all these bitches on me
Can't forget what they told me
Fuck em
My older homie told me
Fuck ‘em, motherfuck 'em
My momma told me nigga
Fuck 'em, motherfuck 'em
I say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Started out tryna make a truce
Ended up back in mine off a 80 proof
But running wild got you thinking you could solve it
We could really use some time
Just to recollect and find out a thing or two
Check the weather, never mind I ain't in the mood
Eyes settled on the prize bitch, I'm in the loop
Strip vinyl, spliff fired up, I get to choose
Which titles my rivals could win or lose
Parachuting through the fall, I wish for summer off
Spring fitted for the dark, nigga in the long-sleeve
Driftin' through it all, niggas know
Niggas know not to hit me, I don't get too many calls
This city shit go, pity how a piggy did you dog
That’s why swampman living in the bog, feeling like a tsar
Off-brand niggas on the spittle getting charred
Swear you can hear death whistle from afar
When the wind blow, feds want your info
Streets full of sink holes, sheets full of nymphos
Brains like a baseball, legs like some pencils
Head for the hills, cause I'm on your heels
Like a bloodhound trained to your scent
Show face when I get dough, my face in the shit
Two cards, blackjack, both ace's, it's lit
Cold case on the mess that I made thugging
No trace of me since, I sin, no place to repent
Close game but we win, motherfucker
Closed game, cold game
I'll fuck you up, bitch

Uh, yeah, this is stadium rap
Hotter than the last name on my alias Jack Rip
Bad bitch flip our gymnasiums back
Track itch shit's dope, y'all should slang it in sacks
Shit's sellin for ten, harder than elephant skin
Benevolent grin, I stay gold, you settle for tin
Wolf Gang, wolf pack, packin' weapons in tens
So take a wild guess as to why they lettin' us in
Please, Earl lettin' the competitor win
Is the equivalent of steppin' with stilettos in gyms
It's not happenin', so while I'm standin' checkin' your chin
Know the flow takes the "h" out of "shins," fin
