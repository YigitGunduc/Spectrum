Yeah, I say, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Now imagine there's a shorty, maybe five, maybe four
Riding 'round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now, I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along, and this what she says
"Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch!
Somethin' that's far above average."
And maybe other rhyming words like "cabbage" and "savage"
And "baby carriage" and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin' here
First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama – comma
And because she's relatin' to herself
As most important source of help
And mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Uh, tell 'em, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
They misunderstood
They misunderstood

Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
On the Internet watching videos, listening to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents
Now, being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
"Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches."
Now, let's say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah, the plot thickens: high heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin'
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)

Disclaimer: this rhymer, Lupe, is not using "bitch" as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection
‘Cause while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sho' enough, in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house, hot mess like that
Ass, titties, dressed like that, all out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
"Bad" mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But "bad" mean bad to him, "bitch" don't play a part
But "bitch" still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch – what a double entendre!

Tell 'em, bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
You're misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, greatest motherhood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living? And cherry picking
Every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay playing at the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
But reign like Queens that reign over made man
And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen
But Queen, like white glove wave hand, and not wave hand, like it's a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand, I'm talking wave, like you saying, "Hey man!"
And not hay for horses, and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords, like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words, like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting, that I was poor,but now I'm more than (poor)
It's still hooker heels, on my sugar hills, and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims, from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows, for my peep pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out, like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise, when the beat drops, and the sun dies, when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapsed, then it detox
Then heat back, like a heat pack, on his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got, like yeah
Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching, nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water-boarding, Barbie doll
A river of women, like a Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis, made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Madri Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position, was black condition, and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they're not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside an Apple prison
Chicken hack, and download updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world, through eye holes, in my oil paintings
Uhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position, or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition, against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves, out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerve storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet, like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration, so that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers, to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buccaro roof painting tunnels, onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces a count of lies
Chocula Counts, by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who’s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging rain and catching hail
Faces need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real still til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!
First off, say "Peace" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine stripper mad dash
A friend request following a hash tag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillacs

Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death

Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for "Thriller"
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the middle
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…

Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

Great American rap resurrect...
Lupe on the check
Westside till I die!
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, And a bunch of other coverups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of "what the fucks"
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homey, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either
I’m a part of the problem, my problem is I’m peaceful
And I believe in the people, yeah

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become an actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash them down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
For real though, like for real though
Like for real
You know what I'm sayin', I don't even
It's like, niggas must forget who the fuck
Did what the fuck
When the fuck
When niggas was still, not the fuck
Or whatever
Fine then, I say

Dear Lord, have mercy on my banana clips
Give 'em half, call it that banana splits
But my halves is really like a banana 6
Do these bananas have any idea who they on the planet with?
Apes, yeah you bananas to the grapes
That mean your bitch got a banana in her face
And wine on her chin, get these heathens off of my trunk
And all of these swine up off my rims
Tryin' to take the shine up off of my Benz
SLR, nigga please
Niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave
Gon' roll around with that B-Y, nigga just roll up my sleeve
Got body plans, so I karate stance so I could open up my chi
Lu the boy, too Bruce Leroy to destroy
Doo doo beat like two T-boys with one freak one me
But I can DP like it's three more
Three rewards for me or me or me or me or me or me
Team me is like meat eating animals meeting a meteor
Dinosaurs, I'm fine with all kinds of wars
Knives and swords, lions, tigers bitin' boars
Lightening striking Viking hordes
Fighting heightened, violence soars
That was Adolf, reacting to my new shit
Translation: how come he can't be as evil as Lu get?
Well that's cause you ain't Lu, bitch
Took two sips of the holy grail
Then I backed up and I turned around
And I bent over and pittoo'd shit
I love Jay, that's my nigga
I feel sicker than a cruise ship
I ain't competition, I don't move shit
The only opposition is this new shit
These new niggas rappin' like they 2
They be actin' like they you, man that's-- wheeeeeew shit
What happened to the game?
Niggas think they Jappin' cause they rappin' like they Wayne
Rappin' like they Chainz
I ain't matchin' them in platinum
But I'm rappin' like I'm flames
Like smackin' them in the back of him and my antonyms is on 'cain
And my heroin is on metaphors and my metaphors is on brains
My left foot is in LA but my right foot is in Spain
Now we all heard what he said, but what he said means we dead
And that shit is insane
He's so crazy, look at the little baby
Nigga you ain't Nas, nigga you ain't Jay-Z
You will respect me, you will reject me
But I've done so much, no matter how far you go, you will reflect me
SLR, nigga please
These niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave
And when the bitch gone, knee shots disabled
DVD of Dick Jones in your TV and a grenade all on your table.
And my punch bowl's like an ocean
And I lay it on by the ladle
But it's so strong, when I pull it out, I'm only hangin' on to a handle
Satan on my ankles while I'm hangin' on to an angel
Ain't hatin' on that you hatin' wrong, cause you can't hang on to my angles
It's hard being a Lupe fan, go to Harvard to be a Lupe stan
I ain't sayin' that I'm harder, it's just harder when it's in Lupe's hands
Welcome nigga, Lupe Land, SLR
Here we go, FL bars
Hold up, go back to the hard part
Would say pause, but I was talkin' 'bout my own balls
Nigga
It's a mad world out here, I tell you
The world's gone stark, raving mad
Everyone in the world is mad
It's a mad crazy world

I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
Listen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause
A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
Shun him while in public disallow him from your stores
Have no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours
Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
But we must still pray that his color will be cured

I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

With her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
He looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains
How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
From the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims
To do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane
You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
You torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame
Blank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name
Perfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints
May God bless the scientific cure for the insane
Knew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change

I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

With his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
Put his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
Told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
Now the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time
With no life inside his body now he finally think he’s safe
But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
Doesn’t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
He forgives them in advance says that he will do again

My fellow Americans...

I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Give me that old school love right now
You know when I hold you, you won’t be alone
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want a (eeeeeeeh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like
Nigga I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school
Wassup...

Give me your old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone...

As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
LA-SER

One in the air for the people ain’t here
Two in the air for the father that’s there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don’t wanna be there

Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that’s livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back, that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I’m on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys

Africa to New York, Haiti, then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell ‘em look at me, boy
I hope your son don’t have a gun and never be a d-boy

Alright, already, the show goes on

Just remember when you come up
The show goes on, alright
Already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on

So, no matter what you been through
No matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise ‘em 'til your arms tired, let ‘em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon’ persevere
Yeah, ain’t nobody leavin', nobody goin' home
Even if they turn the lights out, the show is goin' on

Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on, alright
Already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on

The show goes on
The show goes on
The show goes on
The show goes on
You're so smart, you're like, a contemporary museum of art
That farts, that's harsh, narcissism, on narcotics
On sharp objects in large pockets
At dark, you ain't gotta hide it, keep it, "Metal Gear Solid"
Lead the leaders, that's how you file it, then clobber it
Low on energy, find peach cobbler then gobble it, yeah
It's food in them drums and boxes
If you beat 'em up then they'll drop it
And they'll rapidly flicker till they disappear
Blinking gradually quickens 'til they isn't here
And that's da da da da da da da da da da...
Just to be back in, reincarnated, exact twin
Exact ten, exact twelve
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba (exact self)
Do I really gotta say it? Didn't we all play it?
Dojo, Abobo, over shoulder throw, polo
Billy, Jimmy, even on the low low

Why you ready to die? You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby
These Magi adore you, Adoration of the Magi
These Magi adore you
Why you wanna be born again? You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby

Now let's vogue (vogue) mountain pose (pose)
Downward facing dog (pose) warrior pose (pose)
Tree pose, bridge pose (pose, pose)
Triangle pose, seated twist (pose, pose)
Upward facing dog (pose, pose) pigeon pose
In this bitch, that's vulgar, that's yoga
Let's try it again with clothes, and closer, enclosure, exposures
Quiet is kept like Rosicrucian meet Cosa Nostras on Oprah's sofa
With both controllers watchin' Gazans and Ashkenazzis ride roller coasters
Say yeah, yeah, lots of options, now up is down, two player
Now A is jump and B is punch, you seein' somethin' that weren't there
To find friendliness in a nemesis, it's a old test
Three buttons, see somethin', that's emphasis on genesis, oh yeah

Why you ready to die? You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby
These Magi adore you, Adoration of the Magi
These Magi adore you
Why you wanna be born again? You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby

Can't be eyes closed when you side scroll
You not the first person
The first person from your first curse until your first cursive
And your curse words is in the curve version
It occurs virgin is the word version
That refers perfect to the first person
In the third verse, who's really me
In the third person but prefers the first one
That's me, again
Master cleanse in a syringe
From a gerber until your first burger
Pamper to her depends
Everything between is just drawers
Even in between is no loss
Even where the king is no boss
Meet it with a swing it's so south, yeah
Unless you Bamm Bamm
Knocking them pitches into the grand stands
In the club, watching the women just do them hand stands
Like you a man's man
That's washing down a ham with the Zam Zam
Who got a baby in here with these strippers?
She's two weeks pregnant
Didn't even know, he's dancing with her, damn...

Why you ready to die? You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby
These Magi adore you, Adoration of the Magi
These Magi adore you
Why you wanna be born again? You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh (the return)
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to catch his microphone, check 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me, standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me, I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung "Blue"
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too
Ha ha ha ha-ha-ha

If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh, yeah

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down to the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China, nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five, unless it's pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gonna clap and they ain't gonna praise
They want everything back that they've paid
Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha-ha-ha

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

So chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say "You need to go and see that"
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, "Ha ha ha-ha-ha
Ha ha ha-ha-ha, ha"

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

If you are, what you say you are
Then have no fear

The King
When you’re king of African music you’re the King
Because music is the king of all professions
(N.U. Music)

Best laid plan, make a mess, made
Damnation, let's play hands, sans spades
That's without, a boycott and a sit-out
Afro-Black pick in with a fist out
From the "Welcome Home" to the kick out
Reach into a rabbit, pull a trick out
Preacher preaching to a faggot with his dick out
Hard times call for armed time, hmm
Sick, sick, sick eyes from the nose pressure
Police snip zip ties on the protesters
Six wives in the fry of a molester
Met him at a caviar bar out in Odessa
Dirty needles breaking all the old records
A hundred hoes, one shovel and some old treasure
Ole Zeke use teeth as a gold tester
Finger rolls, finger waves, closet full of old leathers
Old sweaters, old boots, that's a whole suit for some cold weather
New sale, two L's and some old letters
Now he doing double life, while she lead a double life
Man, he need another wife
New approach might help a nigga bowl better
New hoes might help a nigga hold together
Or will the new lane lead em' to the same pen?
And the hunger strike in em' to the same tin

Love is Looking Over Various Errors
And Hate is Habitually Accelerating Terror
Everywhere but the mirror
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I don't wanna be accepted; not as all as I am
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, lamb

Getting slammed from the protest, no food
Force fed him like OB with a nose tube
Visions say consult the yogi with the gold shoes
With the Rollie going bowling for the old school
I need more for the Michaels
That's a loss for the class and a score for the rifles
Three hots and a cot and some cops
Trying to find dinosaurs in the Bible
It's all quiet in the jailhouse
Then they ride in to find the empty cells out
They was looking for the swords
They was looking for the swords
I'm just looking at they feet cause I'm looking for the Lord
Looking in the library, looking at the law
10 years deep, now I'm looking at the bar
Claim sovereignty cause I'm bunkin' with the moors
They degenerate, they ain't looking at the game
They just looking at the scores, they be putting on my books
Cause I'm looking at the stars, trade a shank for some crank
Now I'm looking at a war, BGF got the yard
AB got the kitchen, snitches on PC
M&M on a mission but CO's got the prison
God got us all, God set us free
God is the key, but the guards got the doors

Love is Looking Over Various Errors
And Hate is Habitually Accelerating Terror
Everywhere but the mirror
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I don't wanna be accepted; not as all as I am
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, lamb

Punching on the glass
Scared that some killer might fuck him in the ass
Staff getting rigid, wasn't gonna take away the visits
Segregate niggas by theyself and make 'em stay with it
Wicked, swung the shank around on a mop string
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT Team
That's a cop team
They sent hella cops to stop the helicopteriiiing...
Man, he thought that he'd fly away
Like a kite, take flight, like a letter on a string
Like propellers on a wing but the kite was the key
They made electric chairs for his dying days
Last meals, no appeals for him to try and stay
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac
Maybe he could dig a tunnel out of A Block
And wear gloves for the razor-wired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box
Looking at the world through the TV
And they gone, rapping over beats from the tabletops
Ay! That's how it is in a police state
When your life is just a number and release date
When you're rehabilitated so correctly
And let's hope that's how you're living when you're set free

The orange wings of the new Jim Crow
Are dyed Klansman sheets and court papers
Dreadlocks nooses hang from his neck
As the new Jim Crow Corporations feed him seeds yet unborn
He’ll be captured by Maya in a ruby-encrusted cage
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And answers that I leave in empty pages to be written
Where is your pen? The new Jim Crow
(The new Jim Crow, the new Jim Crow, Crow, Crow, Crow...)

They sell they souls, they sell their selves
They ain't twelve, they old, niggas old as hell
Old as jail, old as cells
Sold so much salt, ain't no more salt on the shelves
You a prisoner too, you living here too
You just like us, til' your shift get through
You could look like us, you know shit get through
You should be in cuffs like us, you should get strike too
You should get like life, you should get like woo!
You should get that twice! You should get refused
The open road, that's no parole and no control
Over your own soul, so control
Your own remote control that your folks can hold

You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these niggas
And throw away the key
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
I'd throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys, I'd throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these niggas

5th year with the DOC
You can see what's CO see
Robocop opt his C-O-P
3 hots and a C-O-T
Lived in a small town, his whole life
Never left, soundin' like the hole, right?
Either working at the prison, or it's no lights
In the system working with the po-lice
In the prison stripping niggas phone rights
Got a malice, on the other side of the bars
Watching niggas get smart, watching niggas get strong
Watching niggas get home, he jail us
But deep down he jealous
With each sweep down, he tell us
With each beat down, he help us
Wrong one gon' knock his ass out though
It's why he gotta lock all the niggas out for
Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound?
It's why they treat niggas like shit
Writing raps to the taps
Keep the face mask on 'em these niggas might spit!

You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas

Carrera (Dumb it down!)
Coolest nigga, what? (Dumb it down!)
F-N-F, up! (Dumb it down!)
(Dumb it down!)

I'm fearless, now hear this, I'm earless
And I'm peerless, that means I'm eyeless
Which means I'm tearless, which means my iris
Resides where my ears is, which means I'm blinded
But I'ma find it, I can feel its nearness
But I'ma veer, so I don't come near
Like a chicken or a deer, but I remember
I'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness
The windshield is menstrual, the whole grill is roadkill
So trill and so sincere, yeah, I'm both them there
Took both pills when the bloke in the trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost or a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as Rosie, pockets full of posies
Given to the mother of the deceased
Awake and at war 'til I'm resting in peace

You going over niggas heads, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They telling me that they don't feel you (Dumb it down!)
We ain't graduate from school, nigga (Dumb it down!)
Them big words ain't cool, nigga (Dumb it down!)
Yeah I heard "Mean and Vicious," nigga (Dumb it down!)
Make a song for the bitches, nigga! (Dumb it down!)
We don't care about the weather nigga (Dumb it down!)
You'll sell more records if you (Dumb it down!)

And I'm mouthless, which means I'm soundless
Now as far as the hearing, I've found it
It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear
Of a stewardess in a Lear, she's fine and she's flying
I feel I'm flying by 'em, cause my mind's on cloud nine
And in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the Underground King
Who's also Klingon, to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks, but I Sphinx like Leon
Or lion in the desert
I'm flying on Pegasus, you're flying on a pheasant
Writer of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers
Spit, "hot fiya" like Dylan on Chappelle's skit
Yeah, smell it on my unicorn
Don't snort the white horse, but toot my own horn
Sleep?

You've been shedding too much light, Lu (Dumb it down!)
You're makin 'em wanna do right, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're gettin' self-esteem, Lu (Dumb it down!)
These girls are trying to be queens, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're trying to graduate from school, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're startin' to think that smart is cool, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're trying to get up out the hood, Lu (Dumb it down!)
I'll tell you what you should do (Dumb it down!)

And I'm brainless, which means I'm headless
Like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplay-less sex is, which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang the chain with
Which makes me necklace-less, like a necklace theft
And I ain't used my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the best-fed F-F jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues; my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas
Westside Poseidon, Westside beside 'em
Chest-high and rising, almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make ya fly with
Personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves
David Blaine, make it rain
You make a boat, I make a plane
Then, I pull the plug and I make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again
Westside!

You putting me to sleep, nigga (Dumb it down!)
'S'why you ain't popping in the streets, nigga! (Dumb it down!)
You ain't winning no awards nigga! (Dumb it down!)
Robots and skateboards, nigga?! (Dumb it down!)
GQ Man of the Year, G? (Dumb it down!)
Shit ain't rocking over here, B (Dumb it down!)
Won't you talk about your cars nigga? (Dumb it down!)
What the fuck is Goyard nigga (Dumb it down!)
Make it rain for the chicks (Dumb it down!)
Po' CHAMPAGNE on a bitch! (Dumb it down!)
What the fuck is WRONG WITH YOU?! (Dumb it down!)
...How can I get on a song with you? (Dumb it down!)

Look B, here's my main, my two-way
Uh, what should I, ah, here take this
That right there, fuck what my boys'll talk about me, nigga
Nigga, you hot to me! I like you! (Dumb it down!)

Bishop G, they told me I should come down, cousin
But I flatly refuse: I ain't dumb down nothing!
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine

With a platinum plaque
It's like Robbin, George, and Jack
The mind fears what the blinds hide
But I'm here on the blind side
Hanging up till the line dies
Then off the hook for the crimes tried
Get awful looks from tribe
Tribe unlawful jux when you climb skies
That's Robin Hood, arrows of the rich'll steal
In Hollywood and featherweight
I step by step, let it escalate
Till you get it, will tell you if I hit it
We can make pie if we don't fidget
Xzibit, Pimp My Ride exquisite
We G's coach us back if we die in business
My Lord is my chemist
My sword is from Khemet, Egyptian fonts and ankhs
Scottish writes with Montblancs let us stomp
I walk as my father walk, master builder is what I thought

You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine

Where the golden means, so the overseer gets overseen
And the over here's are the older things
Can see the bell but don't know the rings
The rings are not sounds, but circles
Wear these on your virtues
See through these circles just like Steve Urkel
Till it's all universal
And it harmonize in like proportion to the larger size
And it's dynamic in the high standard
So each degree has a part to price
See big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity
And little whirls have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity

You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine

The applause and patience of the laws in nature
Override lies and the laws of nations
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations
Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plumb decisions
Perpendicular to the undivision
That's bad curricular to the unconditioned
Any love less than unconditional is so
Under-Christian, it's unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told it's the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The soul's gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half

You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep him happy 'cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sitting on the shoulders, but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news cameras filming this walking project building
Now there's hoes selling hoes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's a car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest, I'm sitting in my room
As I'm looking out the face, something to write about
I still got some damage from fighting the White House
Just a

Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

Now come on everybody, let's make cocaine cool
We need a few more half-naked women up in the pool
And hold this MAC-10 that's all covered in jewels
And can you please put your titties closer to the 22s?
And where's the champagne? We need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain, slow-motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the baby's sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tip-toe 'round, creeping
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see, had the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me
I was

Daydream
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
What a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day
Daydream
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

(Dream, dream)
(Dream, dream)
(Dream, dream)
Uh, What up y'all? Yeah
Soundtrakk, what's popping baby?
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here, I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out, uh

First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week, he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, uh
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark
Yeah, when they said "It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here"

And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast
Uh, uh, uh

My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what what was happening to him now
He said "I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two"
She said "Bow, I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds
Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here"
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said "I don't normally take dates in here"
Security came and said "I'm sorry, there's no skating here"

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, uh, uh
And push, yeah, yeah
And coast, yeah, uh
(Swanky)

Yeah, yeah
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said "There's no skating here"

And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, uh, uh
And push, yeah, yeah
And coast
Ah ha, Swanky
Astaghfirullah, yeah!
Yeah, this one right here, ha
I dedicate this one right here
To everybody out there…
Ya dig?
Check it out

Now I ain't trying to be the greatest—
I used to hate hip-hop, yup, because the women degraded
But Too $hort made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite, I stated, though I only recited half
Omitting the word "bitch"– cursing, I wouldn't say it
Me and Dog couldn't relate, till a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learned it from a song I heard and sort of liked
Yeah, further, ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac
Nas' It Was Written, intermixed with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom, and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world, and listen
It dropped

My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
And I got no place to go
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it hurts me soul

I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
'Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinking "Golly, God guard me from the ungodly"
But by my 30th watching of "Streets is Watching"
I was back to giving props again, and that was bothering
'Bout as uncomfortable as an untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustle to seemed wrong
But these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into
And thought; what constitutes a prostitute
Is the pursuit of profit, then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things
With the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said "Don't knock it, mind your business"
His business isn't mine and that nigga pimping, got it

They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, their cross on fire
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced
So I got no place to go
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang time
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me
Turn off my TV 'cause it hurts me soul

So through the Grim Reaper sickle-sharpening
Macintosh marketing, oil field auguring
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation, Islamic martyrdom
Precise, yeah, laser-guided targeting
Oil for food bartering, terrorist organization harboring
Sand-camouflaged army men
CCF sponsoring, world conquering, telephone monitoring
Louis Vuitton modeling, pornographic actress honoring
String theory pondering, bulimic vomiting
Catholic Priest fondling, preemptive bombing
And Osama and Obama and them
They breaking in my car again
Deforestation and overlogging, and
Hennessy and Hpnotiq swallowing
Hydroponic coughing, and
All the world's ills
Sitting on chrome 24-inch wheels
Like that

They say I'm infected, this is why I inject it
I had it aborted, we got deported
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here
But I got no place to go
I can't stop eating, my best friend's leaving
My pastor touched me, I love this country
I lost my earpiece, I hope y'all hear me
'Cause it hurts me soul

It hurts me soul
It hurts me soul
Hurts me soul
Dedicate, dedicate
This one right here goes out
To my homie with the dream, nah mean?

He said, "I write what I see
Write to make it right, don't like where I be
I'd like to make it like the sights on TV
Quite the great life, so nice and easy"
Sí, now you can still die from that
But it's better than not being alive from straps
Agreed, a Mead notebook
And a Bic that click when it's pushed
And a wack-ass beat — That's a track that's weak
That he got last week
Cause everybody in the stu' was like, "That's that heat"
A bass-heavy medley, with a sample from the 70s
With a screwed-up hook that went "stack that cheese"
Somethin'-somethin'-somethin'; "stack that cheese"
Mother, sister, cousin; "stack that cheese"
He couldn't think of nothin'; "stack that cheese"
He turns down the beat, writer's block impedes
Crying from the next room, a baby in need
Of some Pampers and some food and place to sleep
That, plus a black Cadillac on Ds
Is what keep him on track to be a great MC

One you never heard of, I
Push it harder, further, the
Grind might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop, you saved me
One you never heard of, I
Push it harder, further, the
Grind might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop, you saved my life

Reps North-side, so he rocks them braids
1100 friends on his MySpace page
"Stack That Cheese" got 700 plays
Producer made him take it down, said he had to pay
Open mic champ two weeks in a row
Ex D-boy with a B-boy flow
Glow like Leroy, you should see boy go
Got a daddy serving life and a brother on the row
Best homie in the grave, tatted up while in the cage
Minute Maid got his momma working like a slave
Down baby mama who he really had to honor
‘Cause she was his biggest fan, even let him use her Honda
To drive up to Dallas, went to open up for amateurs
Let him keep a debit card so he could put gas in it
Told her when he get on he gon' take her to the Galleria
Buy her everything but the mannequins, ya dig?

One you never heard of, I
Push it harder, further, the
Grind might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop, you saved me
One you never heard of, I
Push it harder, further, the
Grind might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop, you saved my life

His man called, said "Your time might be now
They played your freestyle over 'Wipe Me Down'
They played it two times, said it might be crowned
As the best thing out the H-Town in a while"
He picked up his son with a great big smile
Rapped every single word to the newborn child
Then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
And put on another beat and got back to the mission of
Get his momma out the hood, put her somewhere in the woods
Keep his lady looking good, have her rolling like she should
Show his homies there's a way, other than that flippin' yay
Bail his homie out of jail, put a lawyer on his case
Throw a concert for the school, show the shorties that it's cool
Throw some candy on the Caddy, chuck the deuce and act a fool
Man, it feels good when it happens like that
Two days from going back to selling crack, yessir

One you never heard of, I
Push it harder, further, the
Grind might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop, you saved me
One you never heard of, I
Push it harder, further, the
Grind might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop, you saved my life
One you never heard of, I
Push it harder, further, the
Grind might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop, you saved me
One you never heard of, I
Push it harder, further, the
Grind might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop, you saved my life

Hip-Hop, you saved my life
Hip-Hop, you saved my life
Black panther, black panther, what do you see?
I see a dreaming child watching over me
Back nigga
Yeah, hey, can we get a little break
From the cocaine and the kilos
Aiight nigga, we know
Aiight nigga, we know
Can we get a break from the strippers on the p-ole
Aiight nigga, we know
Okay nigga, we know

Hey shawty, ain’t no future in no gang-bang
And ain’t no manhood in no bang-bang
Ain’t no honor cleanin’ interstates inside a chain-gang
Know some rap niggas put that shit inside your mainframe
Pills make you stupid and liquor do the same thing
'Raris too expensive and they way too hard to maintain
Get yourself a Camry, "nigga said a Camry?"
Watch that ho depreciate and then you’ll understand me
It’s called being fiscally responsible
Don’t let these lying images up in hip-hop here conquer you
The TV’s not your father, fool, that video’s not your mama
Try your best to be a man and your worst to be a monster

May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth then, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar, ital, iyah

I know you’re sayin’, “Lupe rappin’ ‘bout the same shit”
Well, that’s ‘cause ain’t shit changed, bitch
And please don’t excuse my language
Cause I would hate for you to misrepresent
The true expression of my anguish
And by this far I ain’t shocked, upset, or appalled
I’m ashamed, bitch
I can’t listen if you ain’t sayin’ shit
And recognize all this emptiness is dangerous
Ain’t buildin’ up they confidence, we teachin’ ‘em that they ain’t shit
If they ain’t got the latest that they saw on someone famous
Mercy of the Lord on this double-edged sword
Instead of askin’ where the hoes is
Maybe maybe may we have some roses

May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth then, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar, ital, iyah
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth then, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar, ital, iyah

Called the president a terrorist
Corporate sponsors like, how the fuck you gon’ embarrass us?
Ain’t my fault, I was just repeatin’ this
Professor Emeritus from America
But my tone was like an Afghani kid without a home
Blew that bitch up with a drone
An Iraqi with no daddy, Palestinian throwing stones
The fuck you think they call him? I’mma leave that all alone
Cause this, the focus on this new shit is that hopeless
Place that I was born into systematic brokeness
Took that downpression and developed it to dopeness
It’s that great American rap-rap ferocious

May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth then, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar, ital, iyah
Sometimes, you just gotta —
Go!

You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't fear it so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions, civil war got avoided
Little black sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as an old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Qu'ran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where Fox News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins the Mandela Peace Prize

You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

Uh, and it ain't no projects
Keepin' it real is not an understood concept
Yeah, complexion's not a contest
'Cause racism has no context
Hip-hop ain't got a section called "Conscious"
Everybody rappin' like crack never happened
Crips never occurred nor Bloods to attack them
Matter of fact, no hood to attack in
Somalia is a great place to relax in
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin
The Rat Pack was a cool group of black men
That inspired five white guys called The Jacksons
Eminem fitted in, but then again
He inspired a black rapper tryin' to mimic him
And that's what really rose up out of Michigan
The "sounding white" rapper by the name of 50 Cent

You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy
I cordially invite you to ask why can't it be
Now we can do nothing about the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make it fast or we can make it last
Every woman queen and every man a king and
When those color lines come we can't see between
We just close our eyes 'til its all black every-thing

You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything
(Pow)
30-something shots from the ghetto gun
All in the ears of the ghetto young
Some ghetto girls, some ghetto sons
Throwing rocks at the bus and other ghetto fun
I always wondered where the ghetto from
Cause I'm from the ghetto, the never ghetto come
Buzz you in if the bell of my ghetto rung
And if the ghetto lose, that mean a ghetto won
That's how they do the ghetto, that's how the ghetto done
They keep it, they never bring the ghetto none
What make the ghetto tick, make the ghetto run
What make the ghetto sick, make the ghetto dumb
These niggas off that ghetto beer and that ghetto rum
And that ghetto bass with my ghetto drums
And my ghetto words and these ghetto problems get ghetto sums
That's why...

The pizza man don't come here no more
Too much dope, too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man don't approach (no, no, no)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas on the block, too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)
The pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed, niggas don't wanna starve
But "Niggas ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"
The pizza man don't come here no more
Deliver, deliver, deliver

Is it cause they're selling nicks out there all day
Cause a prostitute sucking dick in the hallway
Little Caesar's never sending pizza out y'all way
Papa Johns never get delivered where y'all stayed
The ghetto was a physical manifestation
Of hate in a place where ethnicity determines your placement
A place that defines your station
Remind you niggas your  place is the basement
White people in the attic
Niggas selling dope, White people is the addicts
White folks act like they ain't show us how to traffic
All that dope to China, you don't call that trappin'?
Breaking Bad, learned that from a TV
So don't say it's politics when you see me
When you gon' apologize for your CD
Nigga, that don't match red and black to a GD

The pizza man don't come here no more
Too much dope, too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man don't approach (no, no, no)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas on the block, too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)
The pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed, niggas don't wanna starve
But "Niggas ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"
The pizza man don't come here no more
Deliver, deliver, deliver

Can I get delivered from the sin?
Get a little slice of Heaven, I can enter in again
Or maybe just imagine that I'm living in a mansion
Or a palace and my pizza gets delivered in a Benz
Make a savior out of savage like they made it out of magic
So it take a nigga havoc and it make it into friends
You don't even need a salad, it don't make a nigga fatter
Actually take a nigga backwards and make a nigga thin
That's a deep dish, Chicago style get the peace stick
Home run hitter, I be drilling on the weak pitch
Pay into the plate then I put it in your face
I'm a man, never biting on the hands that I eat with
No Giordano or DiGiorno
Homemade Bull City bring it to him like a toro
Throwing dough up in the air-bottom to the top and shredder
Full of cheese smarter than a purple ninja turtle

Nigga, pizza man don't come here no more
Too much dope, too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man don't approach (no, no, no)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas on the block, too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)
The pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed, niggas don't wanna starve
But "Niggas ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"
The pizza man don't come here no more (here no more)
Deliver, deliver, deliver

So sad cause the pizza man don't fuck wit us no more
No, no, no, no, no, no
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what

The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young History as
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what

I love the Lord
But sometimes it's like that I love me more
I love the peace and I love the war
I love the seas and I love the shore
No love for no beach; baby, that's law
But she doesn't see, therefore I spoil
I trick, I fall, run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness, status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene, the obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen, I could be her king, together
She would make me cool, and we would both rule, forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever again
And if the rain stops, and everything's dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'd teach me how to fly, even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high, and if I ever die
She would commission monuments on her bosom to him
Or maybe she'd retire as well
A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell, and I'll be

The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young History as
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what

And so began our reign
The Trinity: Her and I, Caine
No weather man could ever stand when her and I came
Hella hard; umbrella, whatever, put plywood over Pella panes
And pray to God that the flood subside
Cause you gon' need a sub 'til he does reply
And not one of Jared's, you think it's all arid
And everyt'ing's irie, another supply
That means another July inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the Unger, Felix
Cause he is the cleanest amongst the
Younger outstanding achieving up-and-comers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and well-to-do mommas
But not well enough to keep 'em from us
The ones that were fighting in class, who might not pass
Rap record-pressured to laugh at a life not fast
"Can you feel it?" That's what I got asked
"Do I love her?" Said, "I don't know"
Streets got my heart, game got my soul
One time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul
Quote to a crying, dishonored baby mama
Who's the mama to a daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes
And a necklace with a solid gold key like the starter of a car
The opener of a door, or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby, but what about lately?
Then ha-ha-ha-ha-ha'd, right up in her face, G
There's more fish in the sea, I'm on my mission to be-be

The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young History as
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what

Come, these are the tales of The Cool
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
And seek unholy grails like a fool
And hang with the players of the pool
Fast-talking on the hustle
No heaven up above you, no hell underneath ye
And no one will receive thee
So shed no tear when we're not here
And keep your faith as we chase
The Cool

(Cool!)
Dis nigga, like he's so exclusive
Sometimes dreams, peace of paper I got reams
Where the D go?, Put that on a rose now you
Pronounce it hero, you see?
Lu see like La Brea & Pico, with binoculars on my peephole
I feel my best work was album zero
Now with Deniro its boo boo in my backyard and
Ben burnt down my gazebo that dinero's a casino
Wit spit in the sandwich of the police though
They ain't see the steel plate up under my seat though
Still play it like Shaquille but I can free throw
I ain't playing but I compete, I ain't a player but I'm complete
And that's the win win a mason mind can't sign if the pen's Templar
Night vision on white linen is still green
Peace of Paper I got reams, make it rain
To make em smile, now rake it into piles
And go buy ya self some style, prom night/cat walk
Prepared the suit for weeks, or effortless as a Parisian
Walking down the street, I ain't in it
I'm just walking round some beats
Tongue in cheek, just talking round some teeth
Neighborhood watching
Made of good options, mastermind times
Neighborhood hoodie take the hood shopping
Back track to the stolen plates
What's a closed wallet to an open safe
Say your grace
Peace of Paper/Cup of Jayzus what we writing?
These ain't entendres these are secret indictments
Litte secret excitements
For willing minds I'm feeling fine
Balling hard and killing rhymes
Knocking off bigs and stealing shines
Hey shawty is it a crime?
To DMV everytime until I give em license
They waiting on lines
Peace of Paper I'm Kerry James
Commissions fly as the Constitution as a plane
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what we doing?
Pizza Lasers/ Cup of Razors
What you choosing?
Choosy mothers choose the smoothest peanut butters
And more cognizant fathers do George Washington Carver
A break from the paper it means do you identify more
With what's being made or the maker?
I'm what's being chased
I'm not the chaser
Cup of JAYZUS Peace of Paper
Check it, now paper make a plane & paper make it rain
But how fly is paper plane in the rain?
I'm fly paper on the brain
This and two-ply paper just ain't the same
I do do it for the bottom
In the air is where I stop em
I threw words like 2 birds, that's Batman and Robin
To answer all your hunches that's just how I throw my punches
We must somehow become a family that's why I throw 'em in bunches
Mushroom clouds or on the flo' with the fungus
If you look em up and down
From the foot to where he put his crown
The slow Pan to understand is Shaq on the shoulders of Yao
Over and over for miles
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS made a movie
Thank God on Friday, then buy a ruby on Tuesday
A couple beats from Jay, a couple beats from Ye
& make Food for thought, that's a restaurant in a day!
It would behoove thee
The critics say that I fell off I acknowledge I slipped
But what do you call falling from space into a bottomless pit?
And not pit like how Lui Kang can knock Baraka off with a hit
Knock it off for a bit
What would be really funny if I blew up after Drizzy
And started from the bottomless back to the topless like a watcher of Strips
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS, bout it, bout it
Don't let ya inner fears result in a outer coward
From baby showers to 80 flowers upon my coffin roof
The upper class glass is not filled up with the coughing proof
Be more P and step ya Yessirs Up
P-O-P! Jayzus a cup of Courage, I can't can't
Thats double negative it's 2 earls
They really nice but they'll never touch the cup its like I gave it to two girls
This my odd future out in front Supreme shop
Fly as Rick Ross at a Wing Stop
Thought Kick Push was about drugs
It's not but just to be super sure
But from your perspective it might seem
Like Supreme out in front of Odd Future Store
So that skaters and skiers
Nose grinders and grinding up
Nose powders with ether
Not an Earl diss either but he might think it be and be like
"Lu's new should be Mr.Pure 2positive Shakur and 2 be sure he's
Not that really nice, That 2 girls and cup line sucked
It really means he gave himself a cup twice"
You just witnessed a double, a probable Odd Future diss in the future
And me ghostwriting my own rebuttals
You can't do that with a single cup
You gone need a couple, again you got a double
Got my shot on the rocks, but don't stop, keep pouring til it's a puddle
Peace of Paper, Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what's the drive?
Greatest Rapper Alive or Greatest Rapper That Died?
Then on judgement day they say the greatest rapper's revived
Oh look who's here the greatest rapper's arrived!!
At the birthday party the greatest rapper surprised!!!
Bumped into Doom the greatest rappers collide
Everybody dead but AZ the greatest rapper survived
I'm not the greatest rapper... the greatest rappers' a lie
Got the same points as Lux the greatest rappers a tie
Told Jean, Foxy, & Rah the greatest rapper's a girl
They said the greatest rapper's a guy
Phone rang it was Ghost he said "Kiss the greatest rapper... Goodbye!"
Chris said Common, Common said Kweli, Talib said I'm sure it's Mos Definitely!!
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS
Smack might have the greatest but now I'm just playing favorites
Playing flavored to be reminiscent of Miles on smack playing faded
Peace of.... these niggas is nice
Knees like these niggas aight
Shins like listen to them, ankles like shins making sense
Feet like why you running behind these niggas
They still trying to step inside ya prints
Bear trap rap don't step inside the clinch
Where da at? Don't jeopardize a better stride for limps
I exercise at length so electrify the fence
Let me inside the danger room on level 5 with the weaponized defense
With an extra side of the next guy's petty exercise attempts
The ghost of my career, better than most of what they revere
I take my targets and throw them back on my spear
I'm outta here
Drogas
Shaka Zulu
Now I can't pledge allegiance to your flag
Cause I can't find no reconciliation with your past
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons' abs
I'm telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
The system is a slab, corruption is the swinger
Sitting high riding dirty, drag racing into danger
And it's so clean, pine trees smelling good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I can't shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor
And as it all falls down in tatters on the floor
I shed tears, I don't know what really matters anymore
Cause I don't know what really matters anymore

Man it ain't mean
The strangest thing you've ever seen
Oh, would you look at how they swing
Would you look at how they swing?
They ain't dead though
No, I didn't die y'all, I cut myself down
And I admire my fall, into grace

Now as I wander through the city going mad
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag
Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doing bad
Then the separation from the truth is getting vast, fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money, delighted by the dummying
Down of the importance of crowns we'll never have
That's why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be living off your sad
Hating on your happiness you hit 'em off with laughs
Smile 'til they surrender, then you kill 'em off with glad
Hello evil, I'm back

Man it ain't mean
The strangest thing you've ever seen
Oh, would you look at how they swing
Would you look at how they swing?
They ain't dead though
No, I didn't die y'all
I cut myself down
And I admire my fall, into grace
And now ladies and gentlemen; Lupe Fiasco
Know you gotta sip that Remy to this one, Lupe
Had to get Blue on this track, you feel me?
Holla at 'em, whoa!
That's all I appreciate right there man
I live for this shit, nigga, you know what I mean
Talk to 'em

I got my chopper full and my black tee, slide
My baby mama done fucked up on her food stamps
That’s three months to re-certify
I’m ridin', niggas be watching, they don’t want these problems
When them bills due, niggas get ready cause no bullshit I’m plottin'
I’m a government baby, let me get my cheese, let me get my cheese
Got a seven-trey in my mama yard, sittin' on D's
I’m bout this fee, I’m bout this fee, just know what’s free
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth so don’t critique
Look at me nigga, just a young hood nigga tryna get this cake
I don’t need to be givin’ out how school gon’ educate
Filet mignon for my food stamps, I know mama credit quite good
So I’m out here with this dope money, got a big body in my hood
Nigga you see it, better believe it, this what I’m bout
Got a trap house I be boomin’ in, fiends in and out
Cut the check anyway it come nigga, section 8
See we straight, see this money I make, this block can stay, ha

Yeah bitch, filet mignon with my food stamps
Would tell you I don’t but it wouldn't be the truth
Let me hit you back on my government phone
Still a hood nigga, whatcha want me to do?
We get a blunt and a joint out of sawbuck of loud
Where I’m from we be actually hoopin’ in Jordans
Five dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes
Ain’t nobody finna do shit important
People really don’t give no fuck about nothing
Although they may smile and be cordial
Dealin’ around with the wrong damn crowd
Then bring a frown to my friend up in an alley, we warned you
Background check for the chopper
The barrel breathin' back down the neck of imposters
The murder rate ain’t back down yet
Cause they ain't wrote that down yet to the nigga that was tryna say somethin’
Some people, listen
You could be predisposed or be preconditioned
Or speak with the preacher, been preaching, be the person
To put some process in your progress or be the prevention
I just live my life and I don’t stop grindin’ until God tell me to
I get money, I ain’t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?
They say my kind ain’t welcome everywhere
Well I can deal with that
But those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them
It's still a fact
So mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine
You’ll solve you'll find that this is
Best for everyone involved, all in all, the Lord my witness

Permit, don’t need permission from a doctor
I been smokin’ since a pre-teen toddler
I been servin’ since a jit tryna dodge all the obstacles
My teachers all told me that were probable
Probable cause, no cracker never really had it
I was just a nigga in a high price whip
Yeah, I’m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto
Well you better have extension on the clip
Well beef comes around in the town
More often than these bitches emotions
I got a yapper, five dollars, off the streets (yeah I'm totin')
For protection more than anything though (you gon' test my devotion)
My first amendment right, they violate it anytime we outspoken
Chicago violence boostin’ up but we just focusin’
On other environments cause the country is taking notice
More fiends are risin', Molly the new dope
And I apologize cause it was something I was promotin’
Chopper in my bitch name in case I light somebody up
You just tell them it was stolen
Rich gunplay, shit that’s all they see that’s all they know
Without it kinda hopeless
Said this in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said all their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me, "Trouble, you gotta put the mac down
Felonies all in your background"
Said this in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma

Lu probably tell me, "Trouble, you gotta put the mac down

I used to run up in your crib with shit that go blocka
Nigga tryna brick my squad like I’m Waka
I don’t wanna see no chain I can’t rock-a
Heard em' tell me life is a bitch, can’t stop her
Even if I could, I tell ‘em I wouldn’t knock her
Til I get that section 8 and then swap her
Baby mama tax return, new dropper
I might wanna go silk that bitch like I’m Shocker
All of my whips wetter than a water house
Food stamps getting flipped, what that water cost?
Yeah I’m actin like a nigga that ain’t never had shit
Filet mignon, porterhouse
My little brother on his medical shit from that block street
Nigga health care insured by that guap
Doorways ain't hiding me, no stop
Jackers playin’ overseas with they yacht
Shit I probably be the same, I find drama
Law’s out lookin’ for me like Osama
I don’t wanna do no bid, Your Honor
Still waitin’ on my one phone call from Obama
Tell ‘em I need the chopper, they tellin’ me I'm a felon
I'm tellin' 'em they got it wrong, I beat the case in '9-7
And I'm well acquainted with Hell but I’m tryna make it to Heaven
But they don’t want me to make it, that’s why the niggas be tellin’ me
If I don’t get the chopper, I’ma probably run up inside them
They better gimme a answer, I’m tryna be cool
If I don’t get it then everybody gon’ fear it
Every week I’m finna make ‘em repeat it like they in school
Bed blues, everybody open up somethin’
You can move all you want just not sudden
It ain’t no thinkin’ I was playin’ I am not frontin'
The mentality of a goon, I am not stuntin'

Storm is gone now it’s all clear, the road was long but we all here
Now go and tell, I don’t care, 2014 is our year
Big shout out to the whole streets
This goes out to all that knows me
All y’all pussy niggas, hold these
Y’all play tough guys but call the police
Look I don’t care, I don’t share
I keep me a bad bitch with long hair
I send them choppers around there
When I’m somewhere sittin’ in a lounge chair
Overseas, blowin’ tree, blowin’ green, throwin’ B's
Livin’ like life is supposed to be
And if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me
To the top, couldn’t stop, had a major deal but it wouldn’t pop
Niggas hated on me but I wouldn’t stop
And now life sweeter than a puddin’ pop
Think so slick, come and get me dog
None of y’all niggas fuckin’ with me dog
Some of y’all niggas comin’ with me dog
None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dog
You think an echo was y’all, you need to think tactical dog
We laughin’ at y’all while you thinking me and Lu radical, naw
Seein’ this shit that keep goin’ on
Then pick a different zone for your mobile homes
Store fingerprints on your mobile phone
When you sippin’ that shit we keep blowin’ on

I’m bout that, I’m bout that, that Bentley out in that driveway
Cost more than my house did, fuck land, I’m fly today
First class if I fly, credit card ain’t mine
Don’t know how I’m gettin’ back but in luxury I arrive (turn up)
IPhone in my baby name, long way from that chirp
Strip pole in my bedroom, but I’ma kill my daughter if she twerk
I’ma kill my daughter if she twerk, Miley Cyrus on that bullshit
But a real nigga can’t judge, that for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college, missed out but no Pyrex
My Harley got low mileage (and this white carpet in my project)
Thirty guns in my section, none of the homies got aim
My side bitch said she pregnant but I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game, I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
And this one is mine, I don’t trust his mama so he don’t got my name
Cheap rims on  my ride, mirrors loose as my beat pound
I ain’t addicted to shit, my weed man on my speed dial

Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
AR-15 with collapsible stock
Picatinny rail with a three-point harness
With 150 round magazine and a dot
Ay, FMJ’s by the box, nigga
Got the same setup as the SWATs, nigga
Shouldn’t find that surprising
Cause I bought the muthafucka from a cop
Ay, seen a lot of brown money as a shorty
Welfare baby can’t afford me
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Excuse me, as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete myself
My opposition is not pretending
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself
Fuck being a hip-hop purist
When I'm  spendin’ 50 thousand on Securus
Embrace the contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It’s why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen can’t fill us, Medicaid can’t heal us
And the mamas can’t stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride
With an L up sayin’ "Free the guys" like I’m Durk (them hittas!)
With a clean record but I’m cursed
To make a half a million off a verse
Nigga, chop
Now little Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed a candy shop, told her "Lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag, take the pennies out the drawer"
Lil Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck in the school is his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots, and black hair
He gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs, then we can get a soccer ball
That's what my commander say
How old? Well, I'm like ten, eleven
Been fighting since I was like six, or seven
Now I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government want me dead so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher but I'm still too young
This candy give me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear
If I'm in your dreams then your end is near, it's me

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon, we're calling you
There's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use, little weapon
Little weapon, little weapon, we need you now, pow

Astaghfirullah
Astaghfirullah
Astaghfirullah
Astaghfirullah

Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A macabre parade of the toys he made
In shemaghs and shades, who look half his age
About half the size of the flags they wave
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
'Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a little loose
Where AK47s that they shooting into heaven
Like they tryna kill a Jetson that struggles little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, devoid of all childish  ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words that's on their own graves
Think you gangsta, popped a few rounds?
These kids'll come through and murder a whole town
Then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down
It's little weapon

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon, we're calling you
There's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use, little weapon
Little weapon, little weapon, we need you now, pow

Imagine if I had to console
The families of those slain I slayed on game consoles
I aim my hole, right trigger to squeeze
Press up and Y, one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs, press pause for your moms
Make the room silent, she don't approve of violent
Games; she leave, resume activity
Start in blue heart, subpar sharp wizardry
On next part, I insert code
To sweeten up the little person's murder workload
I tell him he work for CIA with A
A operative, I operate this game all day
I hold the controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder, he's only seconds older
Than me, we playful but serious
Now keep that on mind for online experience

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon, we're calling you
There's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use, little weapon
Little weapon, little weapon, we need you now, pow
Dark matter with the sparks scattered up above
Velvet hands in the upper glove, touch
Like bad double dutch
And two Amsterdam's ain't enough, D.R.U.G.S
"Don't ruin us, God said", DROGAS
Too much pride we electric slide
We should be closer
Like soca, not a chain but a choker
I see the sun then the clouds then the vultures
Pay respects in my sensei's sculpture
High as the angel on Dikembe's shoulder
Eyes looking like MKUltra
Redacted vision through these dark shades
Bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
Hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak
Park full of art, arteries full of parkay
Beating it, like new games, easily defeating
Or two gangs meeting for the evening
Or two feet on a Riesling (yeah!) slow wind
Meditate until there's no mind
Decorate me with shine till I go blind
BDSM dominated it with no bind
Safe word is don't stop, both or don't go no times

Proceed to the next level (Tron)
Proceed to the next level (Tron)

Coolest, tulips
Flowers, fall from the towers
Like balls from Galileo to lay low
Ignorance is that the world isn't ours
The gall, give them all showers
Tony found the fountain of youth, in the mountain of powder
To only find truth in the fountain, drowning in power
Surrounded with dollars
The moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder
Cut, that's a misdirect
To stir the soul with diseffect
Names don't last like Mr. X
Unless you Galilee, dropping bowling balls on the discotheque
With a disco ball hanging 'round your neck
Dance, it's a new year
Every time I open my hands
Thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal
Yokozunas throwing salt in the circle
Sumo you up off off your turf boy
Tsunami you up off your surfboard
Midas turn Medusas into gold
'Fore Versace turned words into turquoise
Medusa turned coke into stone
With a hand on her thigh, she looked me in the eye
And said

Proceed to the next level (Tron)
Proceed to the next level (Tron)

Come so far, seen so much
I cannot settle for good enough
So I'll sweat and I'll climb
Until I reach my prime
The forces rise and fall again
Through it all, I'll reach the end
In my eyes, there's a fire
And it takes me high

Uhh, yeah, Soulo!
Shoot for the moon, even if you miss, you'll be among the stars (space)
Backstroke in my pool of thought but don't mind the sharks (wavy)
Ab-Solar, system intergalactic soldier
Lupe say, I'm a stoner, I say that I'm much bolder
Trapped in a game where the trap is the game here
Scope this horror, Aquariuses make it rain here
No love for Your honor
Only God can judge us, if you're Islamic, Allah
I've had it up to my collar
With these niggas castin' stones like this Mancala
Proceed to the next level
Dig that with a platinum shovel
Black magic, matter of fact, if matter is fact
A matter factory is in the making perhaps
Uh, erase your database
We race against time, no time to set a date
Tetsuo & Youth induced
Too cool for school, unloose the noose and
Soul!

Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together

And I'll just bite my tongue so wear it like a scarlet letter

(I've always loved you)
Uhh, quiet in the court for the courtship
Marriage of the dork and the gorgeous
Took her from the king of the corpses
He revolve, jumped off the wall of the fort with the horses
This is foretold, Bojangles was tapping in morse code
At least to the mad man genius, tap top secrets and more gold
(All of you)
From the guts of the mother, Kambucha move her undercover
With a $3,000 son she just want a lover
And somebody else to come and try and drug her
Take her off the grill, she done (they will never love you)
Pills celebrating, "We won"
In the system of the women, never knew he had it in him
This condition when the world that they make him become
(None of you)
Cocaine and new high tech ways, smuggle whole things
(I've always loved you)
From the control range that make radio heads with gold brains
(All of you) Depart 84' Jags on gold chains
Developing niggas from a whole name
God is great, but it's snakes on my soul plane

Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together

(Tell me what to do)
Limo to the limit, fill it 'til the brim get in it
You can't get it, if you gotta ask
(Make me pretty) In that case I want two masks
Bottom class, dollar cast, poppin' tags, droppin' trash
In shopping bags 'til Akeem take our pocket cash
(Am I beautiful?)
Write it in lights, molly in the body of Christ
Drop me to the lobby from heights (trust me)
Then over the threshold to redeem the doorway
Fourteen broads like the king of Norway
Fourteen broads having dreams of foreplay
Fourteen arm Shiva, viva la coup!
(Love you) If the government get it, I'm a fool

Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together

Sanskrit dance on the page of the dead book
Don't leave the restroom with the left foot
Flags of Tibet, to bet, to bed, to death, flesh
Release the leash on a fast car
Feed on the keys, fall asleep in a Jaguar
The tip of thy sword is white
Am I night, am I black, am I light?
Have I been this?
Realize my begin when I find where my end this
Oedipus wrecks, motherfucker this better than sex
Material potion the love of my martyr
Currency soaked in the blood of my father
(Will you cry for me?)
Sky burial, let the wind carry you, farther
Than I could (live forever)
An anatomy, not of me, knotting me to it, nodding me to it
Eyes of the I and others, watching me do it
Adapt in each rubric
Kubrick in plot and tone
Lots of bones, scolds to the top of tone
Skim through it is just skin to it
You're so thin you see the sins through it

Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together
(Try to put 'em back together)
And I'll just bite my tongue so wear it like a scarlet letter

Ghettos, America. U.S. to the izzay
Killa in the citywide sprizzay
Where there's sunshine in the shizzade
Judge won't pull him out the pen like a grenade
For acting out their fears like a charade
Til they blacking out their tears like it's lights out
Bring em out the black like a lighthouse
And wave to em before they wiped out
Lifesaver, threw em, hope they catch it
But it's so Titanic to be iced out
That's just scratching the surface like Triple Axels
Want to roll around that Bentley like Crystal Castles
In addition to the chain
That's just to take the attention from the pain
Or is it the mission of the man

On a 747 on the Pentagon lawn
Wake up, the alarm clock is connected to a bomb
Anthrax lab on a West Virginia farm
Shorty ain't learned to walk, already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camoflauged Torahs, Bibles, and glorious Qurans
The books that take you to heaven
And let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpretated reasons for warfare
Reread them with blind eyes
I guarantee you there's more there
Rich must be blind
'Cause they ain't see the poor there
Need to open up a park
Just close ten schools, we don't need 'em
Can you please call the fire department?
They're down here marching for freedom
Burn down their tepees
Turn their TVs on to teach 'em
And move

The more money that they make

Strapped with a bomb on a bus
With the seconds running
Give you the jitters
Just imagine an American-based

Planning to poison water supplies
To bring the second coming quicker
Nigga!
They ain't living properly
Break 'em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give 'em Coca-Cola for their property

But if they ain't givin' it up
Then they ain't gettin' none
And dont give 'em all

American Terrorist
This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

With land on the horizon and passion in their eyes and
What they think are islands are much more in their size and
Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them
Supplies slim, morale once so heavily inside them
Now steadily declining
Return is not an option as necessity denies them
With this they choose to dive in
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving
Are the children of this land prepared to share in their surviving
A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
Not the material things of kings that could never last forever
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together
Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever
And stuck up on a pike up along the beach
Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs
And so began it here. And for five hundred years
Torture, terror, fear 'til they nearly disappear

This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

Ways and means from the trade of human beings
A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine
And helps the new regime establish and expand
Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land
From native caretakers who can barely understand
How can land be owned by another man?
Warns, "One can not steal what was given as a gift;
Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish?"
But the lesson went unheeded, for the sake of what's not needed
You kill but do not eat it
The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it
The forests's were cleared, the factories were built
And all mistakes will be repeated
By your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatments
Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement
And then you rush to have the most, from the day you left your boats
You'll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts

This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep
They discover ancient cars on even older streets
And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth
They can tell that they were civil, not barbaric in the least
A society at peace. With liberty and justice for all
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade
Everything's so organized. They had to be well behaved
Assumed they had clean energy, little to no enemies
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
Religions kinda complex. Kinda hard to figure out
But this must be the temple
This White House

This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth
Yeah, yeah
The Cool
Turn me up

He came back
In the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh to death
Bling, two earrings, a chain layin' on his chest
He still had it 'cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies
Sat like two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy
From when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory
He didn't mind it
But, he couldn't sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just fillin' the casket up
Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second grade handwriting simply read, "I miss ya"
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion
As he laid there soakin'
He saw that the latch was broken
He kicked his casket open
And he...

This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live, then you die
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules
Making your moves
Paying your dues
Chasing the cool

Not at all nervous
As he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it
Working like a, hmm, reverse archaeologist
Except, his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined
Through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold
And almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave
And looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped
Six months after the shots
That'd got him in the box
Wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours
Because he wasn't older
Used some flowers
To brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So, with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home
So he...

This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live, then you die
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules
Making your moves
Paying your dues
Chasing the cool

He begged for some change
To get him on the train
"Damn, that nigga stank"
Is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt
But it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window
Of what he became
A long look
Wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter of fact, only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and gettin' back in his lane
Doin' his thang
First he had to find something to slang
Next stop was his block
It had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot
Where he was shot
Shocked
That some lil' niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there
So they pulled out, and robbed him
With the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said
"You're scared, ain't ya?"
He said
"Hustler for death
No heaven for a gangsta"
And...

This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live, then you die
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules
Making your moves
Paying your dues
Chasing the cool
I'mma just go... And then we'll figure it out from there
They say form follows function
And if you just function properly things will form themselves
Yeah, that's kind of what it is
So on that note... America's most

First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin' around my temple
Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
And they sink in the same sea that we walk
Not that we Jesus, we just don't wait until it thaws
But you can hold my hand like applause, pause
With no homophobia involved
Now if I would've said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls
That would've been the call, but naw
You can't see in ours, but we can see in yours
You can't see in ours cause ours is Kingdom Hall
Yeah, just like that, we just let it roll, you know?
Yeah, and check it, check it

So when that pond thaws and it's no longer Gretzky
That's when we jetski
I gotta catch up to myself, I kind of left me
Are the windows still blocked up? Let's see
Maybe see something we couldn't view before
Been in the stu all day cooking food for thought
Now out the soup du jour for you and yours
Might find sushi for your soul, we call that moving raw
Lions won't cross the line
Cougars won't move a paw
Chickens won't cross the road
Dogs won't roof at all
Always had flow, just added a front door, roof, and walls
Hotter than the fire that into which Koopa falls
But that's only if you super dawg
Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
You can never really tell just who's the fraud
Truth might still be alive like true and false
That's why I never really trust unless it's Lu endorsed
Sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced
Now that's three mis, like you warming up your vocal chords
Add a fourth if your vocals hoarse
Like Mister Ed
Get out of pocket have a horse's head in your bed
Now that's what I call a good night's rest
You know? You know, just plays like that
When you just let it flow
When you sit back and just let it go, you know?

And now my vocals warm
Add a fifth and a sixth now I'm ready to perform
The Buddhist said that I am not reformed
If I ever be reborn I keep coming back as me
Well don't forget the other five as we
Weave the most wanted Angelina Jolies
And Morgan Frees
Send it around the room like we smoking trees
But it's no purple in the circle then there ain't no rolling b's
Just spoken words, thought provoking reeds
Hydro, I'm still strolling on the seeds
Aloe, like the lotion from the leaves
And to achieve it took a lot of token like Chuck E. Cheese
All without touching weed
But I'm still hungry and I'm having lunch for three
This is my form, now what the function be
And art what I draw
And ooh, what I say like Imogen Heap
Good night niggas, go to sleep
You know? It's like form follows function
And if you function properly then
The form will come out of it
And whatever it is, it
It just be what it is, you know?
Quiet as a kitten
Reply as silent as a Raphael-given instrument for stickin'
Or maybe riot as a lion
Would he tie in tiger for attention?
Tiggers and Poohs, niggas and jews
Mr. Opulent Christopher Robinson too
Reversal like
When that predetermined term expires on a turtle's knife
What of Korea, are you scared?
Or is something not there, like a Welsh rabbit full of hares
Animal farms and imaginary bears
The body is a house like a kangaroo pouch
Or an oyster-hoisted cow over crescent moons as it looms low in the night sky
Platoons of coons stand ready for the drive-by
Steady as the medley booms from the Akai
Affirm as in "Aye aye"
Like it the second
Like a junior, like a third, like a eye
Like a observe from the view of a bird as it fly high
Sitting heavy like spaghetti in the belly of a wise guy
Who let these G's out the PI_STY?
Seems they taking cues from The Wire
Okay decorum, and keeping you from wanting to buy it
But you still buy it like you never left its sight
And like a slow gunfighter gun: unfired
Cow dung walls, hermit crabs in the mall, sting ray from the stars and barnyard laws
These are

Hey hey, just cause I got thumbs, that don't mean everybody is dumb, huh huh?
Just cause I got one, that don't mean that they not dumb, what what?

Quiet as a mouse in the House of God
In the jaws, like tyrants in the mouths of mobs
Ripping it to pieces like a picture and a preacher
If a cricket was a speaker, it's its own chicken bones on the garbage can top
Ugly mother freakers is predator, opposite, on top of it, to make it fox
So if similar appeal, administer the seal to make it real
Elephantine but never mind
Half-ton gorillas in a midst, they'll never find
Hungry as a hippopotamus, gobble it 'til your bottom and your body is as wobbly as Skrillex
Eeyores and Piglets, blind bats nailing tails to a riblet
Time only limited(ed) if you make it
Blind rat's nails hold tales of Unseeing Eye selves
Out is out, so they only seeing thy shells
Ghost Dog
Oh lawd
These are

Hey they not dumb
I ain't smart just cause I got thumbs, what, say what?
Hey hey, just cause I got one
That don't mean I'm better cause they got none, say what, say what say what?

The butcher says to the bovines
You're all just pastrami when it's showtime
Cowboy co-signs, attack the cat samples
Own worst enemies
Chop down the trees, we need the axe handles
Like a heel in a sandal saying "hell no"
Or you trapped like the yells of a nail in the shell-toe
Clever as a fishbowl on a sailboat
Landlocked as a ham hock on a railroad
Sandbox by the swimming pool
Two times as clever as a fishing school
Pills for the pressure
Broken seals on the pills for the pleasure
If you feeling ill, whatever
Animal farm, you're all dumb
Tickle 'em with your articulated thumb
A tapeworm will never play the drums, but um
These are
These are

Hey hey, just cause I got one
That don't mean I'm smart cause they got none
W-what, w-what
Am I not an animal cause I got thumbs?
That don't make me smart cause they got none, say what?
W-what, w-what
Here we come
Am I not an animal cause I got thumbs, say what?
Say what, say what?
I know, I know but I gotta get up outta here, you know?
I gotta go pay these bills, I got a show to do, you know?
One time, for your mind

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Wherever I go she go

I love her, and I hate to leave her lonely
Ring-ring went the iPhone, it was my homie
He said, "Let's hit Japan, if we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand, spend it in the south of France"
Nothing further; I jumped, grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
That's when I heard murder
"You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow
Sunrise, goodbyes, and missing you tomorrows"
I turn to see my dream, love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash, that's faster
Than 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Love, love

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
Take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

So let's keep it real, all in together, "Free Chill"
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Don't wake me 'til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap, they applaud, they love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honoré, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been, and
Everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, umm

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
Take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

Guess who's back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams 'fore I went to sleep
To la-la land to count them sheep
I swear you're looking prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together, evermore
For better or, less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to you
But Ian said, "Aloha", and Harley said, "Cheers"
Julian said, "Bonjour", Big O was like, "Yeah!"
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, "Pursue your interests 'cause even if I'm ticketless
I'll be there, by your side
In your heart, and on your mind"
So, as I taxi down another runway
I gotcha, who loves you bae
Now bring it back now

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
Take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Gold medals, them my role models, rollin' old models
Lowered old schools, flowin' cold and goin' gold follows
Flower bearin', call it petals to the floor
Power sharin', call it devils to the door
Power, power, 'til ain't no devils anymore
Flower, flowers, they be droppin' at the feet of my sun
Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum
And who do I meet, to the beat of my drum
It was little Susie Uzi, she sold crack and was a killer
All bitch dope tip, wasn't trappin' with no niggas
Had a long money minor, do that action for them figures
Her influence fully automatic, crackin' off the Richter, yeah
Walked up to my ride, asked me could she get inside
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me, out here in the streets, she ain't have no competition
And with me up on them beats, then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips, she said, "Now here's my proposition:
You just write a bunch of raps for me and I'ma go and spit 'em
Then we take 'em to the radio, the DJ better spin 'em
Then we take 'em to the record store and sell a couple million", woo

I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen

Uh, tell me call up Soundtrakk, have him send a couple beats
Not that "Superstar" shit, she wanted somethin' for the streets
Said it might take like a month, she said it better take a week
Gave my arm a little punch and then she pointed at her heat
Said, "I saw that thing the first time, you don't gotta do it twice
But I need a lil' more info on exactly what I write
Some details 'bout a female, 'bout your life and what you like"
She said, "My life is like a bitch, and I'm just like my life"
Then pow-pow-pow-pow-pow, yeah, them niggas started bussin'
Like that boycott was over and that we had overcome it
She said, "Nigga, hit the gas," went from zero to a hunnid
Now we runnin' from some killers, I was so sick to my stomach
She was hangin' out the window with that thumper she was dumpin'
Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin'
We was swervin', jumped the curb and ditched the whip and started runnin'
Tried to jump over a wall, but it was a little tall
So we ducked behind a bush and that's how we got overlooked
I was shook and breathin' hard and she was sittin' there smokin' kush
Then we both started to glow, we looked around like, "What is this?"
And then we looked up and a light, came down and pulled us to a ship
Like, "What the fuck?"

I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen

Well now this the shit I'm talkin' 'bout, the shit that I've been on
Yeah, lightyears outer space, but still a bitch feel right at home
Now where the bitches? Get them intergalactic asses to clappin'
Break down some of that candy and roll it up in a wrapper
For a rapper, nah, I could never go back to trappin'
And who needs Atlanta when you're on Saturn gettin' a lap dance
With a lit match in your left hand and your right hand is a gas can
And at any given moment, I could burn this shit up
Why you standin' there just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up
Hop in some of this alien pussy, let me know how it work
I'm just sayin', I'm gon' be there and I ain't in no rush
Nah nigga, nah nigga, I ain't in no rush

Ayy, I thought you couldn't rap, when you learn how to do that?
Then what you need me for if you already know how to flow?
Ayy, fuck that, we gotta go, wouldn't even be in this hoe
If you told me from the jump we wouldn't be on this UFO
But I think that I can fly us, stole a key so I can try it
Never thought that I would ever be a flyin' saucer pilot
But first thing's gon' be first, when we get back to that earth
I'ma go back to them raps and you can go back to that work, nigga

I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
Nigga we're goin' home, home!
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen
You can kill me, I don't care—no!

Ayy, look, the basic thing is, you can do whatever you wanna do. Like I ain't 'bout to pass up on all this shit, you see this? Like we time jumpin' and shit. You wanna go back and do what, just rap? You can rap up here!
Yeah nigga, just rap. No you can't, nigga, this is space. You can't, fuck that, we goin' home. DROGAS!
I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I’m not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I’m not keeping up
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

So, what are you going to stand for?
Dreads in the sky, I and I, 2 new Vans on a land four
Take that back, make that 2 new shoes on the van floor
Me and my band out on that road
On a never-back-down-from-my-stance tour
Yeah, touch more souls than a dance floor
While they touch less floors than a hand or
Ceiling fan or - wait, let me tell ya slower
Lift my fans up to the ceiling and you'll never touch the floor
Woah, now if Noah need a rower
I'll be there with my oar till we get back to the shore
Dad made me a soldier, GI Joe to these Cobras
Tryna FBI my Panther, CIA my Sankofa
Infiltrate my Carter, illuminate my culture
While they watching through that buckle, but I stay up on my hustle
Turn that belt back on they self, now I watch them scream for help
Like Africa need aid, or black women as maids
Uncover undercovers turn those maids to Bubba's mothers
Take the hero out the Nino, keep it real as trouble-trouble, huh?
Or maybe cartoon Martin on The Boondocks
Flip the script on chicks who think their shit smells like perfume shops
Help them girls find beauty without a magazine or movie
She Delilah with them .45s or Keisha with that Uzi
Now I know that's contradiction, wants and needs in competition
But it's hard to stay on point with such extremes in opposition
While we waiting on that compromise, proceed with that conscious eye
New gang alert: hashtag occupies
Repper 'til the death of me, FnF, what's left of me
All my hate is for the fake recipes for wrestling
Only time I wrestle's when I'm wrestling with settling
Only way I settle if we wrestle over everything
I know that that don't mix like ecstasy and ketamine
Funny how I'm only sick if you never catch a thing
Argue with your friends over what really the record means
Back and forth about its course, with professors refereeing
Why he so rebellious? Up-front with his realness?
They wanna be fiascoes, reproduce his failures
Emperor is his alias, but not Marcus Aurelius
This is more like Sparta: kick you down a well, kid
And on my last check, I copped the NSX, just like Pharrell did
Well did, better doings to come
My only promise is I'll never ruin the young
I'll never human the sung lyrics in a spirit that's
Superhuman to some, keep you pursuing the sum of
Slums, plus, get up out of them, plus, never forget
Just where you from, plus, make sure that you're ballin'
When you come back up in them, plus, we don't die, multiply
Every single come-up,  parum-pa-pum-pum, yup
Fresh to def she is
From her steps to her set she is
So death might not let me live, ya dig?
Fresh, uh-huh—yes, she is
Had a feeling that it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind, don't play like this, naw
But I'm prepared for it, got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs, even cut my hair for it
Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be looking for light like that, then there go it
Yeah, right over there, so I prepared to pour it
Little scared, my stare lowered, momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already out of my chair
Gather up my Airs on my square from here forward
It's nothing, right
So here go it, whispered in her ear
It's kinda crowded in here would she care to blow it
And she said, "Yeah."

You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight

Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor—it's hard to get
In the car we sit, from the intro
She rolled down the window, just in case I was a schizo
I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm, a little more confident
Uh huh, and then we lose consciousness
She says that I've been waiting for you
And I know you've been chasing me too, since they kidnapped
Me from a castle, I've been thinking of you
I told a fire-breathing dragon he better not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor, yes, you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said, "See? Too beautiful to let you sleep
You're my sunshine"

You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight

Relationship is just thirty minutes long
It's kinda heavy, maybe a little strong
Gonna take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two, before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me: out of the trillions
Of numbers that's in the world just leave me a few
That lead to you
Won't be long then, I'll see you in the morning
Cool?

You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight
What it say?

Ayy nigga, where's the house? Let's do it
Your chest ain't shit 'less a chain next to it
Chain ain't shit 'less gold next to it
But gold ain't shit when a diamond next to it
Your beat ain't shit 'less I'm rhyming next to it
Hah, hah, shining next to it
Shit ain't real, can't find her next to it
Nigga, let's park it on the red carpet
Grammy Awards, my momma next to it, let's do it

Everything look better with a bitch next to it
Rollie on the wrist, let's do this
Top down on a whip that's roofless
Ain't impressed, it's the bitch that do it
Let's do it
Club ain't turnt 'less some bitches into it
It's the bitch that do it
Yeah, yeah

To it, to it, to it
Next to it, next to it, to it, to it, to it
Next to it, next to it, to it, to it, to it
Next, next to it, to it, yeah
Put one in the air like the king's son
For the heir to the kingdom
That means I'mma be the king once the king done
If he don't wanna leave then I might have to guillotine him
I sing some but I rap a lot like the king's son
Microphone checker all across the board you should king him
Diamond mine my mind make princesses like king cum
Every second worth of thinking
Is enough to fill three rings like Ringlings
That's how I kept it on the air is like a re-run
And kept the kings comin' in obscene sums
You see for me it's life or death like a king thumb
Mean something
That's why I don't play when I relay like a team run
And treat every single day like a scene one
Outlook on life like I ain't never seen none

I keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)
Face to the future tell it hi (hi)
Everything is super so is fly (fly)
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high
High
High
High

Post coast to coast gotta dose of every lingo
The latest famous 80's baby like the dingo
Who evaded pushing daisies, dodge bullets like Remo
Remember like Ginkgo when we used to play bingo
Used to be in awe with the pushers and the pimps own
Now I flip cars like the ribs on the Flintstones
Haters got mad and as sensitive as shinbones
Had a Goodyear and my intention is to blimp on
Even if I'm injured I'm gonna limp into the end zone
From game one to the super like Karrine dome
That mean I went to Disney World and you just went home
It's Lupe and I ain't from there
But they root for the away
Yeah they stunned there
Beautifully I play
Gatorade the coach and tubas need to play now
Usually I stay, put em on the roof with more truth for me to say

I keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)
Face to the future tell it hi (hi)
Everything is super so is fly (fly)
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high
High
High
High

The laboratory happy for me cause I'm back with my belongings
Ferrari 'bout as red as when Carrie was the prom queen
Think outside the box like Larry Merchant, Don King
A glacier in Jamaica or a penguin out in Palm Springs
Yeah, keep em in the air like a swan wing
And Imma keep it magic as a Harry Potter wand swing
And my little shop with my terracotta pot
You be talkin' bout your kush, you should come and hear my lawn sing
So put them up like a robbery
A Derrick Rose lob to me
And watch and see I alley-oop it properly
Football or volley-b, hock-el-y, or sock-el-y
You just get the rock to me
Try and put me down like Gaddafi over Lockerbie
I'll lock you in a locker b
Like Bruce Leroy, locked Johnny in a locker see
Shock is the only thing that 2Pac is toppin' me
Hot as rocket bottoms or Kilauea lava be

I keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)
Face to the future tell it hi (hi)
Everything is super so is fly (fly)
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high
High

I said think of your future
You can't do that tomorrow
But you don't hear a word; you see that SLR

O ye tormented souls
My goal is to sit on the globe like North Poles
And thats the top mang, going hammer like a Glock can't
All flow and grammar, no shot drank
I'm so sober when I speak
I call it catching bullets with my teeth
You can feel it in your chest
Like Bruce Lee jumping on your vest
But I can't feel yours through my Superman 'S'
Yes, I'm Superman'd-out
Rare Cartier look like Superman house
Inshallah to my plan hope it super pans out
My life is like Italia doin 100 miles
And the top open like the roofer ran outta tiles
Walk right into Philippe's when I ran outta Chow's
Next up is crustaceans and fast food halals
The beef is all the same, its just how they kill the cows
Somebody tell Malcolm X that I'm tryna steal his style
And tell Cornel West that I'm tryna steal his fro
Go back in time, take the slaves plows, shovels, and the hoes
The masters get the "It Was Written" intro
SLR 10-4
SLR 10-4
Soundtrakk let the beat go
Soundtrakk let the beat roll

In this world I'm so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you can't tell me what you gon do

Cause nigga, I don't believe that
Like 9/11 came from Iraq
Mayweather on the speedbag
Automatic weapons keep the same rhythm he has
That's how the hood sound
Grew up in the hood town
West side ghetto, Windy City Cook Count
Black skies lookin' up, crack pipes lookin' down
Accused of not lookin back, blind nigga look around
City on my back, so the CHI go errywhere I'm at
Presence so shiny, Mercedes so matte
Cop that from Platinum, the color of my plaque
I memorize "Color's" off of Yo! MTV Raps
A nightmare walking in a psychopath's nap
Defeat your purpose like a weed stash in the rehab
Guess who's sneaking in the weed bags
That be me with my me ass
Not tryna be anything but free as
Flow is so nuts, the track is gettin teabagged
Just wanna rap nice, that ain't me - tag
If you wanna be mean, then you wanna be me bad
Call it being Pretty Lyrically Swag
Soulja call it Super Lupe Lyrical
You can't understand me nor mimic my miracles
All I see is me and I'm a mother lovin' mirror-full
Bein' dope is all in the muscle
It's more than just a pause and a chuckle
I bench press elephants, and bowlin ball juggle
So don't be scared to take the Super Lu route
Top 5 alive and I only got 2 out!
School ya on your history, I tell ya what you 'bout
Fight for all the right things and let the Huey New out
Pharrell, what these niggas talkin' 'bout?
2 man Big Pun, a 1 man Slaughterhouse
A 2 album Jay-Z, a 1 nigga Wu-Tang
Young and hungry Mos Def, a conscious rappin Lil Wayne
I don't care for similarities
Cause I'm a pioneer, not a parody
These ain't bars, this is barbarity
SLR... Clarity

In this world I'm so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you can't tell me what you gon do

Holy Shock and awing cattle prods
All up in the action with a fraction of the catalogue
Of my peers, I ain't doin' numbers like Anbesol
But I'm here, and I'm revered
Lyric boy, Based King, Master Chef, All City Chess moves Mickey Donny, Diggy, CRS fool
Carrera Era, Panamera, F-Tool, Emperor, Free Chilly nigga, FNF RULES!!!
'Ye, what these niggas talkin' 'bout?
A Jesus in the desert walking, Dundee walkabout
A self imposed exile, learn to let the awesome out
Even if I was homeless I would still have an awesome house
Cause the world is mine, Lupe to the rescue, the world is fine
Words and lines of mine, I feel. are better than every rap in the world combined!!
And that's how you do it
E'rything flow, errything fluid
Stupid with the raps, but the raps never stupid
Trakk on the music, SLR ruthless
And the next whip is that Ferrari cart
Game over - body parts

In this world I'm so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you can't tell me what you gon do
Now bring it out like a finger in the back of your mouth
Cherubs and cerebellum
Tara at Sarah's wedding, Sam marrying Sam
Band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand
If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't, well then you're wicked
Such is life, odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark grays, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals, vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And tell me of the spinning mothers
And today's mathematics for beloved
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers

How was your day?
Can I make what you say what I wanna hear?
Cause I want you here
The hell that we raised
To the heavens do anything for
La petite mort, la petite mort

They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like probably in the eye
What of the chicken? What is it missin'? Is it dry?
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed
And the tension from its demise
Pulled all of the flavor from the fat and made it flat
And rather lifeless, well there's a place
That has a stunning turbot and more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices
It's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices
My son will call risotto rices
If and when he's left to his own devices, well
How is your memory? Is it returning like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me?
Or was it slippin' like permission? Am I trippin' like field
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth
Maybe like kosher beef
Is it real? Is it real? Is it real? Ha, hah!

Howl at the day
Can I make you my prey?
Cause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear
The hell that we raised
To the heavens make symmetries for
Our petite mort, our petite mort

So glad you're back
But not glad at that you're glad
Where is the glamour in collapse?
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds?
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The atelier slowly fills with baboons
That other monkey business
Where killers go free cause a junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter

How are your chains?
Do they make you behave?
Keep you over here, by your overseer
Fallen from grace
Down from Heaven to memories' floor
La petite mort, la petite mort
Immaculate mother of the holy soul
On behalf of the overdose
We come to you uncomfortable in our ways
Please don't slam the door all in my face

Tried to go to church, church ain't work
Still want to kill niggas
Tried to go work, but work ain't work
Work ain't work for the feel nigga
Really make me feel like a field nigga
Make me feel worse, really tryna' chill
But inside I feel like a steel mill, nigga
And it's hard when these niggas steal mama (what)
When you ain’t got, got a meal still mama
Living off a meal deal mama
Can't stunt with them lil wheels mama
Need a real purse, real heels mama
How dem liquors and them pills feel mama? Lil mama

No man shall prosper
Lord knows if I said it, it's gospel, lil mama
Madonna (donna, donna, donna, donna, donna, donna)
No man shall prosper

No man shall touch this
Lord said nobody can fuck with, your momma

I be just trying make it, I be just trying make it
I be just trying make it, I be just trying make it
They be just trying break us, they be just trying break us
They be just trying break us, they be just trying break us
Raise your hands up, and put your hands behind your head

White T on they shoulders, what drags em off through the streets
In the whip wit' they soldiers, stations of the police
Trying to stick all this time to me
Trying to stick all these crimes to me
Could you just send a dime to me?
Mama please send a sign to me
What's looking like life, is probation and a fine to me
Lawyer said I'd be alright, but I think that he lying to me
They really wanna throw those lines to me
Put me in a line, put the knives to me
Put me in the sky, put it to my side
Then push it inside of me
Holy mother of the blessed soul
They don't love you there, they love you here
I love you like I'm Mexico, say yeah
Santa Maria, Madre de Dios, ruega por nosotros pecadores
Ahora y en la hora de nuestra muerte, amen

No man shall touch this
Lord said nobody can fuck with, your momma
Madonna (donna, donna, donna, donna, donna, donna)
No man shall touch this
Lord said nobody can fuck with, your momma
Madonna (donna, donna, donna, donna, donna, donna)

They sent them all to the slaughter
Baby mama, no father
He was hanging round them murderers
And them prostitutes and them robbers, yeah
Them dope fiends and that water, yeah
Wit' angel dust in they nostrils, yeah
They hit em up wit' that chopper
She was holdin' him in her hands, just like Stigmata, yeah
Said you gon' live here forever
Salvation and treasure, you gon' live here forever, yeah
Died like Ricky on his mama couch, right there in his mama house
Only child, the holy mama's your mama now

No man shall touch this
Lord said nobody can fuck with, your momma
Madonna (donna, donna, donna, donna, donna, donna)
No man shall touch this
Lord said nobody can fuck with, your momma
Madonna (donna, donna, donna, donna, donna, donna)

Mama said, "My son never been no killer"
Mama said, "My son never been no gangster
No drug dealer, no gang member"
Mama said, "My son never been no trouble"
Mama said, "My son never been no trouble"
Mama said, "My son never been no killer"
Mama said, "My son never been no gangster
No drug dealer, no gang member"
Mama said, "My son never been no trouble"
Mama said, "My son never been no trouble"

Let's peruse the essentials of Cool
A brief study on the things so instrumental to Lu
That make me feel flyer than lobbies of Ws
A disclaimer, just a rhymer, no credentials from a school

In my Fall of Rome jeans, my Head Porter wallet
My Neighborhood shirt and my Eddie Chen CLOT
Shit might not go to college but my street smart polished
Like the black fingernails of that punk rock logic
Do the knowledge: man, you can't be punk from projects
Firm disbeliever in your punch clock promise
Was trading off my comics, I was taking them to school
One of Jay-Z boys, now I'm skating in your pool
Not to be rude, I'm just hating on your rules
Like a young 50, I'm on my world tour
Good morning, Singapore, I'm bringing the sun with me
From the Robert Taylor homes to Africa's slum cities
I am American mentally with Japanese tendencies
Parisian sensibility, so stay out the vicinity of
Yeah, yeah, them niggas over there, it's just
Yeah, yeah, now look at what I wear

Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my fancy broad and she foreign
So it's no words and it's no slang
And I'm no trick and I'm no lame
It's just so slick that she's so game, and it's
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, and it's

I like Diptyque candles and Maharishi sandals and
Dita sunglasses, Purple Murder Service samples
I like False T-shirts Dover Street is off the handle
Such a good designer, Junya Watanabe, god damn you
I like Yohji Yamamoto and a Max Roach solo
Leather Gucci belts and Guilty Brotherhood polos
I like Montblanc pens and Moleskine paper
I like Goyard bags and green Now & Laters
Monocle magazine and Japanese manga
Futura Nosferatus and HTM trainers
I love Street Fighter 2, I just really hate Zangief
Only Ken and Ryu, I find it hard to beat Blanka
Keep a Wee Ninja hanging and an UNKLE album banging
If you negative in energy, then stay out the vicinity of
Yeah, yeah, them niggas over there, it's just
Yeah, yeah, now look at what I wear

Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my ghetto broad and she's so plain
Got a couple scars and one of those long names
She-a fight a nigga and cusses with no shame
And her ex-man had her baggin' up cocaine, but she
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, and it's

But my most coveted thing is a high self-esteem
And a low tolerance for them telling me how to lean
See, the most important parts are the ones that are unseen
The wings don't make you fly and the crown don't make you king
Now, God don't like ugly, ain't too happy 'bout pretty
I am ignorance's enemy so stay out the vicinity of
Yeah, yeah, them niggas over there, it's just
Yeah, yeah, now look at what I wear

Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my ghetto broad and she's so plain
Got a couple scars and one of those long names
She-a fight a nigga and cusses with no shame
And her ex-man had her baggin' up cocaine but she
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just

Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, and it's
From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands?

Take time to learn me like court-appointed attorneys
Restore the order, we either join or adjourning
Less you join, I'm up performing the journey
In all earnest, I go so Bernie
Takes another nigga to turn me
Get it straight, I ain't late on states
I'm just sternly stating
How what I do, with grace takes another nigga to turn mean
My returning's like Blockbuster with a tape
And I ain't kind but I don't hit
So you starting at the end, that's the part where you begin
I skip the bullshit so we can start it where we win
Yeah, spoiler alert
I can hear you all saying, "Boy you're a jerk"
But it's cool though, know we gotta rule yo
Get it in, then we win and do it all again, ho

From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one

Now me and words, we made a deal, that I'm gon' keep 'em real
And they show me their secrets, I can even cop a feel
Victorious
Can't match wit, with warriors
I match wig with wits
Similarly can't mix matchsticks with forests
Only you can prevent what I do
Only dew can prevent what's my view
I match matchsticks with wicks
Wicker man, take a sip of liquor and
Spit the lip off warriors
And spit flames, nigga, get in the gang, ahh

From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too, yeah
Well that's for me, heh, yeah I think you're number one too

It's road rage, without a roll cage
Takes courage to run on these roadways
I know you like "No way" but I'm a full race
All so every soccer Terry Fox molding
Go ahead
Don't stop, go ahead
Sitting in your car, just listening to the bars
And there's traffic all around and you feel like falling down
And the music that I'm spewing out, enough to calm it down
'Fore you know you're out your car with your briefcase walkin' round
And them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production
And Sebastian on the hook like being dug by Michael Douglas (yeah!)
So don't start that walk through Echo Park
When life's a one-on-one and you caught up in the jam
Just show some love back to your number one fan

From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too, yeah
Well that's for me, heh, cause I think you're number one too

Yeah I think you're number one too
(Let me put you on game)
(Let me put you on game)
Don't you know that I run this place
And I've begun this race, must I rerun this pace
I'm the reason it's become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
(Let me put you on game)
They love my darkness, I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist
(Let me put you on game)
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this, but they're fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow, I am the one that they march with
(Let me put you on game)
Through the back alleys and the black markets
The Oval offices, crack-houses, and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings
(Let me put you on game)
Through the veinses of the fiends
A paper chaser's pager, yo, I'm famous on the scene
One of the oldest, most ancientest things
Speak every single language on the planet, y'all mean?
(Let me put you on game)
I am the American dream
The rape of Africa, the undying machine
The overpriced medicine, the murderous regime
The tough guy's front and the one behind the scenes
(Let me put you on game)
I am the blood of this city, its gas, water, and electricity
I'm its gym, and its math, and its history
The gunshots in the class
And you can't pass if you're missin', G
I taught them better than that
I taught them aim for the head and hope they never come back
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby, hope he never comes back
I hope he's with your mother with my hustlers high in my traps
(Let me put you on game)
I hope you die in his trash
I can't help it, all I hear when you're crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
Behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had
(Let me put you on game)
Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper
A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs
(Let me put you on game)
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader, the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel, so I make them cool
(Let me put you on game)
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed them from the table that held Corleone's food
If you die, tell them that you played my game
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name
Cause I'm the-- 
There's only 2 ways out of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here forever
There's only 2 ways out of here
One's through the door, the other's through me

Sometimes living in a world like this
It's pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't comply
Pretty easy if you don't complain
Stand there like you don't feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend til the end that you don't fear change
Don't admit that your faith is weak
Don't say that you feel like dying
Life's hard then it feels like diamonds
Your home's just far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Can't understand what I'm saying
Can't figure out what I'm implying
If you feel you don't wanna be alive
You feel just how I am
I'm on the dark side
And you can't come find him
How when it's light all around you
Yeah, But it's dark all inside him
No winners when it's me against me
One of us just ain't gonna survive
My heart been broke for a while
Your's been the one keepin' me alive

There's only 2 ways out of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here forever
There's only 2 ways out of here
One's through the door, the other's through me

This world is such a fucked up place
My mind's such a fucked up shape
Everything down here sucks
Maybe what's up there is great
We all gotta go one day
I just wanna cut to the chase
I wanna stop these nightmares
I just wanna touch your face
All you see is all my feats
All I see is all my flaws
All I hear is all my demons
Even through your applause
All you see is all my flights
Well all I see is all my falls
All you see is all my rights
All I see is all my wrongs
Door keep telling me to fight
Gun on my table telling me to come on
Telling me to to put him inside my hand
Then put it up right next to my dome
Door keep telling me to find a reason
Anything to keep me from squeezing
Simplest things, yea you really like summer
You really like music, you really like reading
Love! I can't win if it's me against me
One of us ain't gonna survive
And my heart been broke for a while
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
Yours been the one keepin' me alive

There's only 2 ways out of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here forever
There's only 2 ways out of here
One's through the door, the other's through me
Tonight, tonight, tonight
The stars are aligned, and the planets colliding
The plan is arriving, and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
The parents are goners, no children to mourn us
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
We've lost all our babies, and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of the rhymer, the pimp and the riser
Your cross, there you'll find her
Hey, hey

Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

Disease, the virus is spreading in all directions
No safe zone no cure and no protection
No symptoms define the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies, and no corrections
Quarantine the dreams and seal off the connections
Don't let them in, not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and want you to have it next and
Don't accept them if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness, some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit and some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war
Invented by the press, just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
Whores say the nuns, nuns say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientist say it only affects the mind
The little boy said it only affects the girls
The preacher man said it's going to kill off the soul
A bum said it's going to kill the whole wide world

Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

"Believe!", so say the neon signs by the
Loudspeakers repeating that everything is fine;
A subtle solace to demolish the troubled conscience
Of a populace with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted
From the masters to the masses
From the antennas on the top of the shrines
Refine the receiver and plant it
During the panic and short it, it reports back
Everything in your mind, everything is lying
Everything is dying, everything is a rule
Everything is a crime, everything was here then
Everything rewind the new
Weather burned the feathers off everything flying
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit
The lavish, the fastest, the clashes, the ashes to ashes
Everything intertwined
My femme fatale my darling fraudulent angel
Once caught her changing the batteries in her halo
Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
Scientist said she's all inside my mind
The little boy said "What happened to all the girls?"
The preacher man said "She's going to kill off your soul."
The dope boy said "It's the whole wide world."

Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Welcome everybody, SLR 3
Moment of silence for them, round of applause for me

I pause to put a round in the palms of thieves
And then clap for 'em, bring it back to 'em
Soundtrakk I bring my back to 'em
Cause they ain't ready for the front, fax to 'em
Like my nigga Mickey Factz to 'em
Aye Mickey what the wicky-wicky wack doin'?
They ain't from us but they're claiming they're Columbus
Their raps come off flat cause they ain't in circumference
They ain't in the cypher of some lifers
Them niggas probation, soon to be leavin' Rikers
They ain't see us as the circle of my peers
Sir cool but he ain't spheres
That means he ain't fierce as this
Sailboat wouldn't survive in the ocean of my tears
Bring it back to the peekhole, that's the circle of my peers
The back is what I said
Ready for the front, I rap it out the back of my head
Know it like the back of my hand
Cowboy, you calf like the back of my leg, you ain't seein' what I said
That's cause it's comin' out the back of my dreads
You ain't see it, gotta watch what I say
Wash a nigga away or dock a nigga pay
I bring it back to the piers
And if you ready for that, you've just received the deadliest catch
That you've seen in years
Match, and if you think I'm playin'
Back when you were sayin' "What in the world was that?"
When I was sayin' 'bout the world
I was talkin' 'bout when the fuckin' world was flat


So what we got here? Some Top Ramen talkin' 'bout some top tier
Some top rhymin' to some boxed ears
Such a waste of my timin', that's why I'm not here
This recite is just a sight of the
The real me is out droppin' crop circles all over Iowa
You're witnessin' a one man cypher-a
One hand's a gun, the other hand's a silencer
If I cock the thumb, you gotta take a hike to the
Hitch, cock, psychotic, did you get that plot?
If you ain't get the words then just make a little bird
So you can hear what the fist don't stop, this shit don't stop
Let you debate whether it's birds tellin' or motellin'
Those fingernail shells come out my pistol top
I wear a Rollie so my wrist don't watch
Cause he don't like to see it, ain't that a bitch?
The same wrist I shoot the three with, game winnin' remix
Revisit the ship, upon which niggas seasick
Floatin' on the water out the eyes that I see with
Burnin' on the fire out the eyes that I see with
So as we heat seekin' the seen heater sea-seein'
But fuck it, it's too far off the deep end
I don't need a reason, I ain't talkin' to 'em
I just CC'd 'em Tetsuo season

SLR 3, Round of Applause
Silencer on my hand so my rounds won't sound at all
Now how that sound to y'all?
Maybe how dog whistles sound to dogs
Tetsuo season
Album comin' out, super soon
That's right, so I'm gon' ride this wave
And niggas poppin' shit, it ain't got nothin' to do with me
And just capitalize off all the free press
Because my publicist charges a lot to do the same shit
As these niggas doin' it for free
And I can just rap, because really
Shit don't mean nothin' to me
I can rap all day, pop shit all day
And you niggas just soak it up
Believe it, if I stop, still gets headlines even though my Twitter locked
And ain't that a bitch?
Yeah, What up, Chi-Town, New York City
Philly, Atlanta, Virginia
They said it was coming back around man
Back to the lyrics man
Come back to people like me, I say...

It's mean, soldiers
Now let me put the streets down like steamrollers
With the CATS that push
40 oz. through the hood like King Cobras
See we sling soda
Cause the extra four in the split is mixed
It's really thirty-six
Used to buy toasters and clips
You can tighten your circle or boa constrict
While you was lighting your purple, I was over the scripts
See, I could walk the walk, couldn't really talk the talk
Had to get my talk to properly explain my walk
Cause this lack in talk had my walk looking off
Now I'm over the limp
Watch how they mugs drop when they see my Verbal's able
That's the Usual
When I was po' I was low
Now me and my Chaps cop Purple Label
It's Ralph Lauren on the rap laureate
Niggas brown nose, they are like Alf to him
Runners at Interscope are not as Stoute as him
Please don't Interscope
It's gonna be a whole lot of Iovine and respirating
If I lean out this window with Irene
Niggas as tall as Yao Ming
With L-U-P-Emperor
Is the foundation's, I-beams and the antennas
It's so serious every time I write my John Hancock like
Could damn near see Detroit, I see you
Niggas is scared of heights
This is Saran Wrap and aluminum foil
Some potpourri, a little machine oil
I stack my paper and throw off my scents
This is top floor, better look out below
Pennies from heaven is the same as a semi from the second
And I reign supreme
Turn your umbrellas upside down
Did you even catch the change in theme
This is gangsta man

Lupe to the F to the I to the A to the S to the C to the O
From the west side of the C to the H to the I - C - A to the G to the O
This is gangsta man

And them niggas ain't Was nor from his regime
Gangsta lean
Hats on tilt like these Snickers ain't drop out the vending machine
You gotta put more money in
And I shake niggas up every time I drop a bar
(2 for 1)
It's horse in the Porsche and bricks in the box
Like mo' money them every time I cop a car
You see I'm a roller, right
So it might be a Rover, right
But every time I drop an 'r'
Get off the streets
It's "over," 'ight
Bet I be in the head like overnight
Like rollers, right
She the chauffeur, right
So I keep her sober
She don't get Fed Ex like overnight
I am Dolemite
All that gas can't help you but solar might
Just call on sun
Drop a 's'
Pick up an 'o'
Uno, put it all on "one"
Brace yourself like overbite
"For that quiet nigga that relocated down south
Coming back to floss"
Nigga get your molars right
Fix your grill
No plaque but a whole lot of cheese
This the drill
Mr. Chill gave me the green light like Yoda knife
So I'mma force my will
Like the Force I wield
Of course you will
Take my time
But weight behind only pertains
To that Porsche grill
It's snakes in the hood
Gotta watch for that Cobra bite
Let me see
There's snakes in the hood
A bird, a horse behind the grill
Something gator on the seat
And a fox behind the wheel
No it's not Noah's Ark, Ahk
It's just a flower's start


For achiever
My procedure's
To proceed at all cost
With no breather
I'm all walk
Rain, snow, or fever
I'm all coughs coming after your teacher
I'm on the ball like FIFA
Viva
Lupe Duce
Long live the leader
I remember I ain't have sneakers
It was welfare
Coming up for Airs like
Whales there
Fila, but now I'm well here
I'm Shamu with twelve pair
And niggas wanna take me back to zero like tare fare
Well, my skill's clear
You Sea World
It's Braille here
I'm Bumpy Johnson I stick to the streets
Keep my dogs out in front of me
You see what I'm saying
And I push ki's wonderfully
This is gangsta, man
I wipe the cool from my eye
Stationed in Antarctica; coldest nigga alive
Flow is Armageddon, might smite crows from the sky
Before you drive you have to wipe locusts off your rides
But I'm warming up, oceans is on the rise
I be Ocean with 11 associates on my side
Colder than Chris Martin guitaring
Would you look at all these spies
But they can’t see me, I took out their eyes
Replace with some he’s, so all they see is eh’s
But I will never run, not even if they cry
See I can never fall, not even down their cheek
But I will always bawl, let’s see who the first to blink
And I don't need no passwords cause I don't need to cheat
But you can say your last words, and you can rest in peace
I’m the hook after your last verse I’m also like the beat
But I will turn it down so you can go to sleep

So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep, yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep, now you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off, phony nigga nodding off

Insomniac since way back, see this is what I been like
Baking eggs and pancakes, eating that at midnight
Getting up and going hard, I don’t need no Enzyte
Come across as very calm: mental state is Zen-like
Always had a lot of heart, never been the tin type
Never will I drop a dime, never been the 10 type
My girlfriend is very fine, yes she is a ten right
Mink is draggin’ on the flo', fire in my windpipe
You should come and clean up after the riots that I incite
Things get off the handle, left behind a landfill
Traffic at a standstill, stadium is fan-filled
Fill this bitch up with fans you still won’t blow my candle out
My "can do" spirit's in the house
And is possessing your possessions, did you hear it by the couch?
Boogieman under your bed, not in your closet
Cause I'm not a homo, won't drill no door hole
I won’t make a peep, so you can go to sleep


I wipe the cold from my eye
Then put it in my stove and hope that my dough rise
And then my clothes dry, but I am so high
I am sitting on the storm that I got soaked by
Now you can come closer, you can get warm but you get no pie
But you can sell it for em so here’s you bow tie
Now get ready to fall cause humans don’t fly
The boy in the balloon - see? I didn’t go hide
And I'm coming back to float again
Close down all the opium but I had to O-P-EN
They said they need a hero in it so I'm back to dope again
Pull up in that old-school Flintstone drop on rolling pins
Time is all behind me, this make me feel old again
Grandma's all around me, I can feel her soul within
Hope my daddy over him; woke the roosters, woke the hens
Everything's cashmere, count the sheep that you…
If talk is cheap, then my silence is diamonds. Preach
Uhh.. yeah
He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes
Everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it
He mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box but he can't remember how to stop, it
Uhh, so he continues to watch it
Hoping that it'll give him somethin that he can box with
Or how the locksmith, see the box as, locked in the box
Ain't got the combination to unlock, it
That's why he watch-es, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might show him
What to take off the locks with
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it
As the doctors jot it all down, with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental, like that

And he never lies (he never lies, he never lies, uhh)
And he never lies (uhh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (he never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all

He just sits, and listens to the people in the boxes
Everything he hears he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not comin out the box he blocks it
See he loves the box and hope they never stop it
Anything the box tell him to do, he does it
Anything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it in a box
When he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps
Cause he stays up to watch it, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might get stolen
And that's the last of the boxes
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it
As the doctors jot it all down, with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental, like that

And he never lies (he never lies, he never lies, uhh)
And he never lies (uhh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (he never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all

(Anything at all..) He never lies
Uhh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start

And he never lies (he never lies, he never lies, uhh)
And he never lies (uhh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (he never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all

(Anything at all.. anything at all..)
Uhh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
{*repeats and fades as Jonah ad libs*}
Ohio
Tennessee
California
Endlessly
Right on, right on
Right on, right on

Laid back, villain on the smooth tip
All things gravy, greatest fear to let the groove slip
Always tell the masses that it's never gon' stop
Cause you never gon' do shit
Magnify justice over long lost blues riffs
Mop up, sop up the tears for fears with a Q-tip
They proceeds to poke out they eyes with a toothpick
Remember when Larenz Tate beat Terrence with the pool stick
Or when Caine pistol whipped Chauncy and that fool snitched
Sent the tape to Bill Duke, would've went to jail
If he wouldn't have got killed in that drive-by by the dude he kicked
Cuz he was like, "It ain't mine"
And she was like, "You the only guy that I do it with"
Remember when 'Pac and Q start fightin' over Steel's house
They broke a vase, Steel scream, Raheem told 'em to chill out
The jheri curl Blood that bumped Ricky eating chips
The same guy they was looking for when Ice Cube stopped to let Cuba out the whip
And wan' it sad how Loco had the habit?
And wan' it funny when they caught T-Bone, dancing with that rabbit
Didn't Rocket have the same gun that the old man shot OG Bobby Johnson's son in the back with
Or do I got it backwards
And Bobby Johnson was the one that put his fist up to the glass
And Caine put his fist up and dapped it
And Chicago and Regina had sex inside the mail truck
They left his ass, he reached down to get his hairbrush
And Tré lied to Furious, sitting down get his hair cut

Yeah, do you remember these
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese, huh

Caine told him as he jacked him at the drive-thru
A hundred bucks will tell who Radames put the knife to
Another hundred for the cop who chased New Jersey Drive crew
The group who took Ricky ball, Crip or Piru
Kicked Doughboy and told him he could buy a hundred balls
Little Bobby used his bed to iron out his overalls
Who knew in a few he would have a gun aimed
Caine had a nigga's Daytons skatin' on his Mustang
Remember when the whole crowd stopped and got tense
Then they cheered when Steel put his hand up on the fence
Then when Gee Money first got married to the cocaine
And Chris Tucker OD'ed there watching Soul Train
Cam'ron shot him in the car and took his gold chain
Nino was free till he met up with that old man
And Ice-T was there and he oversaw the whole thing
Mello lost his legs just to get up out the dope game
Why he throw his gun into the river, though?
Just to hit the roof to get the juice and let Bishop go
Show Hodges love, but the Pac Man day came
'Specially after sprayed little ese with the spray paint
Remember when Bobby took off his tear
And when Doughboy disappeared
After his brother died and he said nobody cared
I still do, after all these years
Because he should've played ball
Ricky ain't deserve none of that at all
These are just a illustration
Of a few scenes that helped raise a generation
At my brother's Janazah
Tears stained sunglassses
A Salat with no bows
Pallbearer carry you to the car now
Chilly day, Mosque on 96 and 3rd
New York City way, me and Jay never left my side
Rest like that picture with your pride
Who look just like..
Now the city looks less bright
Brooklyn looking less special
Don't carry the same weight
As when you were on this level
You: work in progress from 40 projects, God bless
An inspiration and a king
They won't know what I mean but this one 'bout to spring
Protect it with every feather on the wings
So even when it hurts, you'll never feel a thing

Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold...

Let me clarify the chorus
And what my cold war is
Cause the complexity is enormous
Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets
To reinforce every single word that I talk with
Something about losing things, human beings
That reduces things to their most elementary
Find yourself where you never meant to be
With the energy of memories
That's the soul force of what's behind killing me
Finding pleasure in the pains
Like finding desert in the rain
Twisted: how this world can drive you masochistic
Question if I'm over it
Or if I'm numb because I'm closureless
Or my closure's that we all gotta go and shit
Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it
Still happy that I opened it


In the studio writing these words, one after another
In memorial of my brother
As you listen to the album with
Nothing on the cover
I imagine that he hovers
Right in the back of this chair
Floating right there in the air
Nodding his head to the music, I slightly lose it
Ask why do I put myself through this
Crack a smile, look up at the file
The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean
But I feel that it's all lost, or maybe that it's all gotta cross
Happy with his dedicated song
But now he's all gone
But he was never there, cause
He was everywhere, nowhere and down here
Maybe on that judgement day, rise up
We'll both open our eyes up, climb up
Hoping God forgives us for our tendencies
Wipes away our cool young histories


Ride around, you know what I'm saying
All over the world right? I mean, everywhere
I mean we just disappear and just come back
I feel like we can just put him anywhere
He'd find his way back home, y'know'm saying
Another random thing's that consequence to me
But maybe to you, not much
But with that said, the reason behind me
Why I do what I does, love
Just riding around bumping that, uh
Either Jay or Nas, or me
He used to tell em like "yeah you alright"
But you ain't fucking with my man
It was always like that, so
Drop a little for you, let it bump
This that Esco music, it's that Esco music
Bumping with my Esco music, that raw
See you on the other side, As-Salamu Alaykum
Read my lips, clarinet, talk that walk, pair of steps
Two shots, parachutes, two drops, pair of troops
New drops, wearin' roofs, full bloom, bearin' fruits
Full moon put the where in wolves’, apparently put it in the air and shoot
Heirlooms that's what I leave, heirlooms that's how I weave
They don't care to you and that's hair to you, this what I breathe
I'm the heir apparent from a pair of parents
Taught me that sharin's carin' so I spread the bread out
That's what I need
To get in heaven that's when I bleed, get in hell when I breathe...
Get it? Inhale, when I breathe
Maybe you'll get it when I bereave, there's levels to this shit
And there's devils on the level of this bitch
We all ball even the devil gotta pitch
You fly so that's red bull and a fish
You can have that, that's complimentary
True story, documentary
Ninja Turtle, sewer side
Though continentally West Side

I'm just riding around town crown of thorns on my head
Living till I'm dead, yeah
Show your respect
Show your respect
Show your respect
Show your respect
Show your respect
(Bow down to the nigga with the horns on his head)

I'm King James with a blunt lit, my name ring like a phone call
It's only right that you meet defeat, I guess that's protocol
Soulo ho, oh God, Lord knows like you never said yes
Success, I'm on the verge-in, like I never had sex
You upset as fake breasts, but don't stress, it looks good on you
He couldn't get it understood, so I stood on him
Food and liquor, in my belly, of the beast but you knew already
I used to complain until planes I flew already
Now I'm ready, amen, like one guy I'm so heavy
Let's say tons, that's blasphemy, with eight guns, keep your machete
Young mind, fuck the world, that's an orgy with an OG
Ironically, when you're high as me, you won't need floor seats
This flow here for King Rich I won't stop 'till my team's richer
Mind, body and spirit on top of the dollar, spinnin'
My optimism is why I'm in this position
You pray, I prey, it's just that I'm a lion bitin' his victim

I'm just riding around town crown of thorns on my head

Pay homage, I ain't gotta plan it to play with comets
Save your comments, (trigger finger make you vomit)
(Egghead just makin' omelets to move the chickens like Reaganomics)
This world so damn ugly I won't put make-up on it, just bein' honest
Keys on us like dope dealers, open doors for the lost souls
(Ring on keys like Swizz Beatz, to make sure a nigga never lost those)
(Amateurs get locked out, we janitors with the mops out)
Clean house, I used to wanna be the GOAT but I'm the Ox now
Rap like I went to Oxford with bastards, threw Glocks on 'em
Red and blue, now the cops on 'em, (ayy nigga)
(Hell yeah, you, with them dots on him, infraredin' you)
(Intellectual like Inspectah Deck, protect your neck from Lu)
Cause we the children of the night!
Of the livin' dead lookin' for some light
I got some lean up in my Sprite
I call it the Jesus Juice, Lu, what would Jesus do? Whoo!

I'm just riding around town crown of thorns on my head

I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't
Let you leave
I don't know what you want
You won't want from me?

She said to him
"I want you to be a father
He's your little boy and you don't even bother
Like 'brother' without the R
And he's starting to harbor
Cool on food for thought
But for you he's a starver
Starting to use red markers on his work
His teacher say they know he's much smarter
But he's hurt
Used to hand his homework in first
Like he was the classroom starter"
Burst to tears, let him know she's serious
"Now he's fighting in class
Got a note last week that say he might not pass
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us
Cause you ain't never pick him up
You see what his problem is?
He don't know where his poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's making a hole; you've been digging it
Cause you ain't been kicking it
Since he was old enough to hold bottles
Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that
He don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart
When I try to provide and he say 'Mommy, that ain't your job'
To be a man, I try to make him understand
That I'm his number one fan
But it's like you booing from the stands
You know the world is out to get him, so why don't you give him a chance?"

I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't
Let you leave
I don't know what you want
You won't want from me?

So he said to him
"I want you to be a father
I'm your little boy and you don't even bother
Like 'brother' without the R
And I'm starting to harbor
Cool and food for thought
But for you I'm a starver
Starting to use red markers on my work
My teacher say they know I'm much smarter
But I'm hurt
I used to hand my homework in first
Like I was the classroom starter"
Burst to tears
Let him know he's serious
"Now I'm fighting in class
Got a note last week that say I might not pass
Kids ask me if my daddy is sick of us
Cause you ain't never pick me up
You see what my problem is?
That I don't know where my poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's making a hole - you've been digging it
Cause you ain't been kicking it
Since I was old enough to hold bottles
Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that
I don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart
When my momma try to provide and I tell her 'That ain't your job'
To be a man, she try to make me understand
That she my number one fan
But its like you booing from the stands
You know the world is out to get me, why don't you give me a chance?"

I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't
Let you leave
I don't know what you want
You won't want from me?
A'udhu Billahi min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem. Bismillah-i'r Rahman-i'r Raheem
Allahu Akbar (x4)
This is one's for all my brothers and sisters who died in Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan and right here in America
(Jesus Walks)
Abraham Taught
Muhammad Taught
And Moses split the sea
(Jesus Walk with me)
I ain't tryin' to profit off the prophets so this one's for free

G's up along with Muhammad and Jesus
In the Quran they call him Isa
Don't think Osama and Saddam is our leader
We pray for peace, but the drama intrigues us
All, so we fall for the illusions of the beast
So instead of tryin' to teach we show our teeth
Same God, different beliefs
Hijabs, Sunday clothes, yarmulke, kufi, same mission beneath
We all tryin' to get to where the sufferin' ends
In front of the Most High bein' judged for our sins
Can't front for the Most High, so the struggle
Continues
You, every bee, bird and tree, he, her and me
We virtually on the same boat
With the same goats, on the same sea
Tryin' to stay afloat, and put the devil in the yoke
With a couple of God's quotes

Ash-had an la ilaha illa llah
(Astaghfirullah)

And to the sisters and the mothers of ours
Who cover theyselves cause they're lovers of God
The Creator of the worlds, Sculptor of the stars
During Hajj, we walk, through Ramadaan, we starve
Though you not eatin', there's a feedin' of the mind
A defeatin' of the demons, a seein' of the signs
A leanin' on the lines from the surahs
Getting purer, God deemed it unclean
(There's no eatin' of the swine)
Nor drinkin' of the wine
We all bend to his whims, so I send out a message to my kind
I’m cordial to Mr. Norful, Mrs. Adams you’re the theme song when I’m battling
Creflo, player, what’s happening? I can hear the truth in your rappings
(No)
Sex before you marry
No grudges
You should carry, no lyin'
Not supposed to be gamblin'

(I know it sounds familiar)
We all the same man
It's all a game
The devil hate each and every one of us exactly the same
(I wanna walk like Jesus, talk like Jesus sall Allāhu ʿalay-hi wa-sallam)

You know
(uh)
And to my Akh's tryin to stay on their deen
It gets mean especially when you stay on the scene
And at the same try to stay out of trouble
But don't forget the blessin' is in the struggle
The Most Forgiving will forgive it if you stay repentant
And hustle
You gotta stay on your salats, your zakats, your Quran
To my homies and miskeen
Astagfirullah
Allah forgive us all
For we all are sinners
Bless us to be among the winners
When it ends
But until then please strengthen the mission within our hearts
All praise is due to God
(Amen)
Tellin' it how it was taught me
I ain't tryin' to sell it can be brought for free
This is how it is
Now how it ought to be
Muhammad talk to me
Jesus walk with me
I hope
Today, nobody cares
But tomorrow, they will, they will
Today, nobody cares
But, oh tomorrow, they will, they will

They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around, I'm beaming
(We are)
They used to talk, when I wasn't around
(Lasers)
You see me now
(We're not)
I'm beaming
(Losers)

I get my energy from my inner G
I be in outer space but I got inner peace
So tell my enemies that they can't injure me
I know that irritates, you have my sympathies
Well you should protest, yeah you should picket me
I'm on a losing strike, I'm on a winning streak
I'm out in left field, I'm speaking mentally
But that's a better place than where the benches be
I'm feeling really good, me and my different beat
Me and my different drummer; he play the timpanis
See that's what got me here, you hearing me
Me on my "black man in the future" shit, call me Billy Dee
See I'm just forward looking, that's how I really see
See while you Valentines, I'm thinking Christmas trees
And that's how this would be, even at Micky D's
Semi-colon, closed parentheses

They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around, I'm beaming
They used to talk, when I wasn't around
You see me now, I'm beaming

Do you remember me, the guy from verse one
Failure's my last name, Never's my first one
You see I hood a lot, and yeah I nerd some
Hood's where the heart is, nerd's where the words from
Don't represent either because I merged them
It's kids who wanna leave, and I encourage them
Go out and see the world, never return from
Yeah you don't come back unless you learned some
And baby girl what does it matter where your purse from
Your hair done, your nails did, your ass fat, but you're dumb
Mix Melissa Ford with Maya Angelou
Become a top model and Sojourner too
I try to follow this, what Muhammad do
It's such an old soul, inside this sonic youth
It's why I'm Ferrari'd up, and I'm conscious too
I don't prophesize, I promise you

They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around, I'm beaming
They used to talk, when I wasn't around
(Lasers)
You see me now, I'm beaming

Yeah it's me again, the guy from verse two
Well this the last one, it's almost curfew
It's almost night out, so turn ya lights on
Where all my 760s with ya brights on
Yeah they are the ones to keep your eyes on
Like how we used to do to keep the house warm
Now those the type of eyes I not cry from
You see the tears of fire run out my crying songs
Now the world shoulders is what I'm crying on
The world's fast lane is what I'm driving on
What am I driving at, I'm trying to drive it home
I'm in the drivers seat, but you can ride along
It's never cyclops, it's never I alone
I'm telling your story wherever I perform
Now if they looking for me, you tell 'em I've gone
Out in the bright lights, right where I belong

They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around, I'm beaming
They used to talk, when I wasn't around
You see me now, I'm beaming
Hello Gorgeous
This phone call's probably being recorded
Just know that I did it for the four of us
And those motherfuckers kept ignorin' us
After this I'm going underground
If they come asking give them the run-around
How does Costa Rica in the summer sound?
Couple days then we moving to another town
Yea I know them dreams, seams
Just know that time'll never come between
Space either, fake features
Things that we reject but connects all us believers
The insurrection's gone viral
They'll never stop it now, I hope it all spirals
Outta control, like a dam with a hole
From here on out it's all about survival
The way we left things they probably think we rivals
But don't be naive, they hate you more than I do
Remember always speak in opposites
I hate you so much, it's such a compliment
I know that defies the common sense
But we ain't never been right: honestness
We never fit in school, and never did rules
But who'd a thought we'd turn out bombing shit

I'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel
I want to drive you through the night down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dark but have no fear

He said he was just so tired
Of them fighting our water with fire
He said that we need something drier
To really impress the empire
Funny cause he really hated war
But why we went to war is what he really hated more
Said it's silly how that our schools make us stupid and our jobs make us poor
When he came back from the Corps
Is when he really got serious
Read a lot of books, started acting all mysterious
The VA is what really made him furious
Told him his condition didn't exist, period
That's why he started that petition
Went all the way to Washington, said they didn't listen
To a white male Christian
He just laughed when they took our father's pension
He said that you gotta act in opposites
Helps you hide your tracks when you stand up to the dominant
But I knew he felt bad
Told me later was the saddest day he ever had
To see our dad so hopeless
That was the turning point that's what really gave him focus
I didn't agree with everything, some of it made sense
But never thought that he would do something like this


I know you don't watch but your brother was on TV
Couple guys in black suits came around to see me
They went through all your books and took all of your CDs
My granny said you'd be all right, she saw it in the tea leaves
All the operations going well, had a lotta contact from all the other cells
Everybody, everywhere is calling you a hero
They going through the rubble, but the body count is zero
It's all violent and bloodless
I know the government really loves this
This account is hacked, you know how to keep in touch
I'll never see you again, I hate you so much

There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same
Roc-A-Fella, 1st &!
Jay
Lupe!

Yeah, uhh
And so it seems that I'm sewing jeans
And 1st and 15th is just a sewing machine
So I cut the pattern and I sew its seams
And button in this hustling then publicly I'm Buddy Lee
There's no busting them and cuffing them is like
Ushering in the regime, they want me to make Prince pants
But I withstand, I ain't gotten into that
A little big in the waist, two-pocket on the back
Call them Lu-vi's, old jeans covered in blue dye
Give 'em the game, that's like giving chocolate to the fat
Look: how you think I got here?
That's the same game that came through where I lived as a kid
In the bad luck truck and threw boxes off the back
Made me a ripper, deliver like river
Content a little more thicker, slicker
Yeah, and they said oil and water don't mix
Now they all down at the beach washing off the fish
Was Blackbeard till I brought the Roc into your ships, YEAH!

It's my life, my life, everything I do I do for you
I do it all for you, everything I say, you know it's the truth
I'll say it is the truth, I'll take all the pressure off of you
Take pressure off of you, I'll take, the pressure off of you

YEAH!
Uhh, it's hella proper (proper)
Cause it sag so low you can see boxer, like a boxer's
That's the way that the Family's pants worn
Don't be sly and try and put 'em on
The stones in the pocket'll drag you down to Davy Jones' locker
Beware if you wanna rock the Knickerbocker
Other nigga from the block what, they was selling O's
Like Wheel of Fortune, of imported cocaine
Just to feel important, it was "Do or Die"
They was tired of being "Po' Pimps," not for sure
That was just a product of my common sense
I guess, I was just guessing like the consonants
Momma said beware of what the devil do
Tell 'em that your soul's not for sale like the W's
So go ahead and pirate, the highest
Cannons make you leak like pirated my shh
It's no shh.. it's just shh like quiet
And big homie's out of retirement, nigga

It's my life, my life, everything I do I do for you
I do it all for you, everything I say you know it's the truth
I'll say it is the truth, I'll take all the pressure off of you
Take pressure off of you, I'll take, the pressure off of you

Uhh.. Young, uhh
So the pen is mightier than the sword, my Lord
My first picture was a line-up, now I'm on the Forbes (uhh)
And I still remain the artiste through thees all
If you force my hand I'll be forced to "draw" (hahaha)
If the war calls for Warhols
Hope you got enough space on your hall's walls
I make niggas murals, then escape the Bureau's investigation
Out in Europe on vacation
I'm back for these puppies with the pound boy (RRRRA)
Here's a round boy (RRRRA, RRRRA), down boy
Sound boy, you don't wanna soundclash loud noise
Leave niggas paranoid if not paralyzed
Which means you can't walk in my shoes
Too much green you can't talk in my hue
Extend the team, nigga holla at Lu'
1st and 15th, that's my cue, I'm through

It's my life, my life, everything I do I do for you
I do it all for you, everything I say you know it's the truth
I'll say it is the truth, I'll take all the pressure off of you
Take pressure off of you, I'll take, the pressure off of you

Plus I'm laying on the floor, blame it on the Go
Little rapper turn it out because I'm very plugged
I convert, I can work anywhere in the world
You can ask my brother Hugg
He'll concur that I'm serious with the words
To the man up above, thank you very much
That I got what I got and I'm at where I'm at
Like an "a" in a circle, with a pay, lil Urkel
What they say when they see lil G
From the F to the F with the amazing verbals
While they race in a circle like they racing a gerbil
I race in a circle like I'm racing a horse
I'm racing a Porsche, while they racing in place
They race in a cage, I race on a course
'Course, that case in the court did not defer the dream
I am still a raisin in the sun, raging against the machine

Beyond clean, in phenom jeans, little rap Isaac Asimov
I let my momma in the rhyming that she raised me off
A 80s baby on fire like a safety off
Got my hood riding higher than some 28s
Off of everything I spoke like a 84
And they in love with him and I'm in love with them
And we'll never ride dubs again, no we won't
Trying to get Above the Rim
A little too short to dunk, so we donk
