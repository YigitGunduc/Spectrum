Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings out my lap
Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap, hey
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?

You talk that talk that make a lame ass nigga fall in love

They be like, "There he go!"

You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no power steering
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Yep, yep!
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
They be like, "There he go!"

I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They say so, ridin' with the payo'
They be like, "There he go!"
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)

I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass

I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter - juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the new principle, sometimes I'mma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Dang, dang, dang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"

This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words

Young Rascal Flatts - young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?

Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like:

You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'mma be that - CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said: "this my favorite song"
"Hold my purse" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car 'cause it's got cursing in it
Your boy like: "I'm the one who showed you," he want his percentage
'Cause you were like: "this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"
Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing?
'Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too

This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack

Thirsty, thirsty, tryna choose

My Nitty bag, my kitty boost

Chano, Chatham's own
Foolies glad I'm home
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on
Rest In Peace to my Vagabond
Rapper song, singer, suspended, subpoena
For misdemeanors, dreamer

Acid addict, costly avid actor, Kevin Costner

Hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you
Knowin' bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, IGH!
But I love y'all souls, don't let the juice spill Pac!
Blue pill pop 'til you feel good enough to pop
The popped bitch in the blue heels, yop!

Hunnid proof get found in a youth nigga
Stop with all the tryna' introduce nigga
Everybody know you dude, you the new nigga!
How's it feel to be you? Yo no sé
I ain't really been myself since Rod passed

Hit sensei, master

I just faced a Veg-er
And you love being Kobe when you make the lay-er
'Til you realize everybody in the world fuckin' hates the Lakers
And then everybody wanna sip
'Til the juice spill everybody wanna bib
And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits
And the thirst, just the worst, it's the curse of the juice!

Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, old ways
Still got a letterman, no practice
Still got a burner, man, no lacking
Still outtin' Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to land, where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill
Got a blue and a hand full of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it, Nitty the old me
So I'mma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

I got that mmm, mmm

Pimp slappin', toe taggin'
I'm just tryna fight the man

I'm your, I'm your pusha man

You a laaaaaaaame, and your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas, yes
House safari, mi casa, yes
Poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party, she popped a Molly

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

Move to the neighborhood; I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'mma still watch my bros)
Trapped in the middle of the map with a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack, and a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at? Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees, look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not, I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs

(Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics)
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
(It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't....)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up
(Good God)
The blessings come down
Good God
When the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down
( the blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Good God)

They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!
(Good God)

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
(Good God)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
When the praises go up,  (Good God) the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(the blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)

It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

My druggy

Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy

Let's get lost, let's get lost

Damn, I'm in so deep, girl
Probably 'cause you're empty
You can't even speak (IGH!)
Damn, your mouth so minty
Ooh your mama hate me
Daddy wouldn't let you, if he ever met me
If he ever met you
Put that shit behind us
And put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums
Minus all that shit it's lined with
I say oh oh oh ohh
You been scratchin', you been fiendin'

Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost

Damn, I need a minute... aight, lehgo
She fell in love, it fell apart... aight, let go
She met her match, I let her match
She lit her match, she let me smoke
Yeah me mad petty, yeah me bogus
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah me know
Yeah she knew too (IGH!), it made her love it
Her pussy like me, her heart like "fuck it"
So dance for daddy like Gator
Ain't no partners on this trip
And lose yourself in my room
And find yourself in my grip
I'm sayin'

My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost

I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "pill pop, baby girl 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek"
The masochism that you preach
Practice back flips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
IGH!
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away
Angels, na, na, na, na

I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got angels

I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded
Wap the bam (na, na, na, na)
I got angels
(I got angels) I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded
Na, na, na, na
I got, I got angels
They was talking "woo woo, this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded

Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got, I got angels

Na, na
Na, na
I got, I got
We used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work, your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place, but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute and realized what booties could do

We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with the parties, so tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do, I'll get close to you
I remember you, you used to, I remember you, 'cause

We've got so much history
Baby (juke), maybe (juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke) I'm crazy (juke)

We never rolled at the Rink, we would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more, you just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing, it's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor, all the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do when they grown and they dating

We've got so much history
Baby (that's right, that's right), maybe (that's right, that's right)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy, crazy about you

We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with the parties, so tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do, I'll get close to you
I remember you, you used to, I remember you, 'cause

We've got so much history

Flame on, flame on, I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps, but better when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on, killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm

My name Soulo cause I'm the one and only
She only got you as a nigga on the side

Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh-igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings

Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today

Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick (On the mic like it's a dick)
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit (The shit)
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep

What's good good? And what's good evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why's God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow Him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot
I got a lot off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya kna wha mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Buck buck bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News!"
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool

Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass

Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right

Right? IGH
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but
My hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe

Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demons ass

Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas
Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us we tryna get lucky
Doper than Lucky
You're ending happy, that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot
But y'all still love me ugh
How father time a deadbeat
Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, IGH

Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right

Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'ma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds zan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good

Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, I'm good

So good...

Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some "x" on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say "The Rapper"
Magical word (poof), please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays; Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done
I'm good! IGH!

Ooh ooh ooh ooh, I'm good

Ooh, ooh, ooh, incredible

Socks on concrete, Jolly Rancher kids
I was talkin' back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank-top, nappy headed bike-stealin' Chatham boys
None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We were still catchin' lightnin' bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark cause the big shortys act hard
Okay now, day camp at Grand Crossing
First day, nigga's shootin'
Summer school get to losin' students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer
Our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summertime don't got no time no more

'Cause you're my friend
Summer friends don't stay
You're my friend
Summer friends don't stay, stay around
Summer friends, summer friends
You're my friend
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, hey
Stay around here

Oh I used to kill 'em with the long hair
Mama hair salon doin' perms out the armchair
Dad was workin' late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns
Fold my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!
Now I'm the same way, overtime all the time, every night, hey
Ready my blessin', now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
79th, 79th, 79th, hey
79th, 79th, 79th, hey
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the flirt
'Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
Fucked up and fucked all my friends

'Cause you're my friend
All my friends
You're my friend
All my...
Stick around

Summer friends, summer...
You're my friend...
Summer friends don't stick around
Stick around, hey

So lay your head on my table
Lay your, lay your head on my table

May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful, grant you favor
And bring you back safely, I love you

When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up
If this is my last shh- my last shit
Uhh, it definitely be mad important
Ey man, that sound like a Prince song

Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth

Somebody pray for the god, oh lord
I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit
Rappin' trappin' trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died - yelling YOLO was a lie
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain’t tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last Chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint

Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth

This part right here, right now
Right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car
I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit
I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit
I hope you love all of my shit (IGH)

Why toss my filter when she saving my life?
The same shit that kills us, always feels so right
That's why I pray to the dealer
God know who he be
Truth be told he juiced me
Introduced me to the lucy leaf
Oh oh oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire
Flyer on the wall I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night
In the sky I get higher, higher

Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth

This part right here, right now
Right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car
I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit
I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit
I hope you love all of my shit (IGH)

I'm still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth
I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as momma's hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must’ve missed the come up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes

I made it through, made it through, made it through
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming (Coming, coming, coming)
So are you ready?
Are you ready?

Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
And we back, and we back, and we back

They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter, I was acting a fool
But who would think the raps would turn into racks?
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you
Scars on my head, I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body can't rely on myself oh no
Last year got addicted to Xans
Started forgetting my name and started missing my chance
L.A. for four months, end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city, bitch, I sleep in my hat
I felt hogtied ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride
I know he up there he just sit and he wait
I'll be racing up the stairs I'mma get to the gate singing

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

Oh! All my days

And now I see the finish line
Oh I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine, yeah-eah

Hey! Gimme the water, gimme the water, I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray I got to pray, like Hammer after “2 Legit”
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrap the stupid shit, I stand up like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much you'd think they drive an Uber whip
Damn, queen said, "Why we in a queen bed?"
I said, "It's yours, don't worry little bean head"
I'm just here to catch my breath, I got a world tattoo
She said, "Cool, just bring me some food"

Oh! All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Oh I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine, yeah-eah

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Part 2: Drown

The water may be deeper than it's ever been

Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers, so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away, to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise, she likes her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child, I know my God
I know my God seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love

Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown

Never, never, never! (Chance, let me in, come onin)
This thirst in my soul (There's a thirst in my soul, it tell me)
Where else can I go? (where?) But you (come on)
I may cry a river (I may cry a thousand tears)
But you take each drop and you wash (you wash me new)
Me new (people sing)
This water is deep (yes, yes and I need you to)
Jesus rescue me (come on, save me, I need you to)
Take me to your mountain (hallelujah)
So someday Chicago will be free (someday we'll all be free)
Be free (say!)

The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see how great, is our God (oooohh)
How great (how great) is our God (ohhh)
Sing with me, how great (how great) is our God
All will see how great, how great, is our God
Name above all names (name above all names)
Worthy of all praise (and my heart will)
And my heart will sing how great, is our God
Name above all names (name above all names)
Worthy of all praise (worthy of all praise)
And my heart will sing how great, is our God (whoa-ohh)
How great is our God (how great is all good)
Sing with me (won't you sing) how great is our God
(How great, and all will see)
All will see how great (how great, how great) is our God (ohhhh)
How great (how great is) is our God
Sing with me (sing with me) how great is our God (and all will see)
All will see how great (how great) how great (how great)
How great (how great) how great (how great)
How great, how great, is our God, ohh

The first is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer

Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit a Spotify to qualify a spot on His side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis, the book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrify the enemy like Hedwig till he petrifies
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide, 79th, 79th
I don't believe in science, I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs, color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom, Hosanna Santa invoked
And woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth with swords
And fortify the borders where your shortage lie
I used to hide from God, ducked down in the slums like "shhh"

I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat
Hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages
But never got no hear back, or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently
Row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach
My petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud
Couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there
When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height we wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley
For every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations
With a foot on water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a Harley
From the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber
And put the true name of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures
And gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking a, we just
What the fuck is going on?
When did we buy a bowl?

We just been smoking a bowl
We don't got no time to roll
I'm always out on the road
She don't got time for a whole
Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
It don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her

Let me crack this blunt
Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh
She said, "let me lick this blunt"
Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break

Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoke to Fetty, sing ZooWap
Traphouse 3, Guwop
I shoulda knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh

Let me crack your back
Slow it down for a second
Take it down, ooh
Let me run this back
Slow it down for a minute
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break

I don't have time to finesse
I put some ice on your neck
But I ain't holding you back
I spend my time on the road
Super ain't saving no hoes
I don't have time to patrol
Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down, ooh
I got to lay back the roof
I got her breakin' the new rules
She can't be taking no calls
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me her mom was a whore
I gave her percs for myself
I give her a perc for esteem
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly its clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be overseas
I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and gars
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least
You can

Let me crack your back
Let me rub you all over
Take it down, ooh
Let me make this blunt
Make you dinner or somethin'
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break
Na na na, na na na

Introducin' Chance the Ruthless, trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid, loosely based on music, swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BANG!)
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of allusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended, last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley, always in the hallway
So I never been classy (Ha ha ha)
Shut up!

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na

Acid, Acid, get it? Acid, melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper if this was work, I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with Jack
Lickety-split, look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back, give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra I eat it like Idi Amin
Ya kna wha' mean, hit me back when that mean shit

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(IGH, IGH, IGH, IGH!)

Three Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh, I rep the East Coast

(Get to the chopper!)
I splash summer like a fast brother, with a number on his back
Ain’t no fumblin', in fact, I'm back, acid in my hat
Shoot, then pass the gat
It's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag (baaaaag)
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
'87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef’s salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn’t help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm

I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again, they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After 1Night the folks thought I was finished
I pinned my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different
New sound, new appearance

Give a fuck about a bitch

Thanks for coming guys

'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla
Everything's good
Rubbin' on yo chin, sippin gin, Margiela brand chinchilla
Everything's good
My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos
And some fruit snacks, and some killers
Phone numbers on speed dial call them save monkey guerillas
Everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodbyes
I ain't really that bad at leaving
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses, even persons leave 'em hurtin' bleedin
I ain't really help the helpless
I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses
I'm good like books in churches
Harolds and Hooks and Churches
Everything's Good
See my name when you Google search it
Use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's Good
But I knew I was fly when I was just a caterpillar
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin'
With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings, birthdays, even Tuesdays
Wednesdays, Thursdays, weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events
Damn it feel good to be a gangsta
And it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account
Off of songs I barely could think up
'Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound
And I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo
Thanks Justin, lending them pencils
Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto
The time I beat Chris on Nintendo
Nanana hey hey, good intro
Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller
Remember the first time you heard this through and thought, "damn that's that nigga."
Everything's good
Here’s a tab of acid for your ear
You’re the plastic, I’m the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan’s Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I’m drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I’m the don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I’m a kamikaze and I’m a kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling I’m a neutral
But I’ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I’ma fuckin animorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele & Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand’s son, breaking walls like Samson
But I’ma throw a tantrum 'til I’m on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighter’s up 'til life is up and light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it’s nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.4’s for 15, yeah my nigga, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies though, choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan
IGH! Nigga
I burned, I, I bu-, I bu-, I burned
I burned, I, I, I burned
Br-br-br, hahahah

To be worried bout my brain cells now, nigga
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now, now now now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now, IGH!
I burned too many brain cells down
Down down down down down

Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
Ain’t no questions hit it vividly and pass me
Don’t answer about your problems
Or your issues or your Ashleys
It’s a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's
Cinnamon tone women and feminine’s getting intimate
All broads is frivolous, homies could get they dividends
Is he illiterate, literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger affiliate
Sick twisted prick, sick sadistic
Son of a biscuit, man fuck this shit
IGH! I burned too many brain cells down
I burned, I burned, hahah
I burned too many brain cells down
Burned too many brain cells down, sing it with me

I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now

What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love
IGH!

I've seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on top of the head
I know you've seen it all before
But when it looks you in the eyes, it ain't nothin' you could say but "that's love"
That's love
That's love
That's love
Say that's love, ooh ooh
That's lo-o-ove
That's love
That's love, that's love, that's love
I LOVE you! (Love you)
I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you! (Love you)
I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you! (Love you)
I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you! (Love you)
I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you!
That's love
That's loooo-o-o-ove, that's love
Say that's love, ooh, ooh, that's love
That's love, that's love, that's love, that's love
Charlie Bartlett, John Bender
Class Switcher, Time Bender
Chance Bennett, a peculiar name
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name
You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job
We was all outcasts, only listened to Good Mob
I performed at fun fair, fun fact
I'm never going back to school, been there, done that
They see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps
Don't call it impossible, if you really want that
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
Chano y tequila you know you know you don't want that
I rap my songs in Spanglish, I wrap my weed in blunt wraps
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap
Yo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain
It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham
Until the day they said I would have to chat without em
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
And this is your night, homie, shine bright
This for everybody's fucking prom night

And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

Uh, yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo
And snap a couple candid's of the family, get some cameos
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours
I'm waiting on the day, Spring can't bring flowers
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty
This is for my momma Jan who spoiled me
Look what we've accomplished
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo
Bumping 10 Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again

And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane
Go and get your racist on, all white everything
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading
I ain't even write this down I don't write errthing
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving, going all night sledding
Coked out like "Don't change when you grow up
I hope you get some change when you blow up"
Cause honestly I've always loved the way that you could throw up
Rest up on my shoulder, float up flying lotus
"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara"
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
I really enjoyed my prom night

And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

So good, so right, hey baby
So good, so right
You know it feels so good
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
Turn the radio up and we can have a good time
Got me feeling like J.J. on Good Times
Back when Thelma had that ass, off the fam good
My sister said she likes my raps cause it sounds good
Told me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters
Sitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders
Till my pops popped me off, that was family matters
Used to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams
Now I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen
Mama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'
Trying to live our lives like our lives are so golden
Got big shoes to fill like try go bowling
Til we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out
4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?
Summertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out
Riding getting nice cause it's nice out

Let's land in the land where the Famo stay
Grind all day til the fam okay
It still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray
For the fam of my friends when my mans go away (x2)

Don't wake up, don't wake up, don't wake up too fast
Don't make up your mind, you should flake on that class
Sing all you want, just don't Drake on they ass
Shore you got drive, don't turn fake on they ass
Good morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck
Tonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck
Bizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck
A new SLR and Ferrarro deluxe
No money for the meter when I'm parkin' em
Gassed than a bitch no car with him
Market him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game of operation with Parkinsons
Young kid rappers, kidnappers
Young whipper snapper that will whip past ya
Will get at you, come get at you
Wanna break ya off, Come Kit-Kat you


Now the team work make the dream work
Go ahead and send an application if you need work
If it need hurt, then I'mma bring hurt
How you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt
Now you finna play it loud, listen how it's goin down
Didn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now
Chi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny
Got some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in
Going all out for them hoes again
Now I'm fin to bring the fucking flow and bend it back
And show it's more to this than rap
Love my parents for supporting cause they know I'm finna crack
Know my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs
But I'm tryin' to get em cheese so I can get em out the trap
Now my figures getting fat, a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack
But I got her on my lap, All she do is make it clap
I believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise

Chancelor the rapper, Chatham the hood
Santa to children, had to bag up the goods
They say I'm savin' my city, say I'm stayin' for good
They screamin', "Chano for mayor," I'm thinkin' maybe I should
Fucked a few A&R's, told 'em, "Bitch I can’t wife you"
Told your ass since day one, I don't like labels or titles
I'm a rascally rabbit, I know that tricks is for addicts
That need fixes for habits, in love with carrots and cabbage
I'm a savage, established, bad bitch magnet, I'm magic
Your majesty, I'm majestic, I think my message is massive
Think you passive aggressive
I think you passed up your prime
Think you passed up your chance to be Chance
Now pass it to A-Rap
I should have rhymed it with rhyme
Ain't we been here before?
Ain't my principal told me that I can't rap at that show?
Then I rapped at that show, simple as that
Got a complex from Complex off of the simplest raps
And it goes like...

Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir

I believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise

Blow out your speakers, roll some more loud
That's the sound of the reefer, I think my parents is proud
Thank my fans in the bleachers
Think my teachers need features
I think I'm walkin' with Jesus, I knew my feet wouldn't drown
I been close to the edge, I been trippin' and stuff
Somebody slipped me a mickey
But I ain't giving a fuck
Really, a milli? How 'bout six billion more
Or I'm outie like how'd he cut that umbilical cord?
As I smoke herb in this Uber suburban dressed in an Urban Outfitters
Shirt and burgundy pair of Jordans
I asked the acid if words were worth worryin' over
Her explanation seemed agitated
She said let me answer your question
With some questions questionin' yours
Like why the devil can't get you?
And why these labels can't catch you?
And why'd he make you so special, why did he bless you?
Think about it
I woke up this mornin'
I woke up this mornin'
Gotta smile when I say that shit, I woke up this mornin'
Go!

Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir

I believe, I believe, there's somewhere out there for us all, there's a paradise (there is a paradise)
I believe that if I die, I'll see my homies somewhere in paradise
(I'll see 'em somewhere in paradise)

Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir

I believe, I believe, I believe
Somewhere in paradise
I believe, I believe, I believe
Somewhere in paradise
I believe, I believe, I believe
"He should try enjoying life, rather than spending his time trying to outsmart me. While he's alive, that is"
"I know what you're saying but it's not that simple, it's just human nature"
"What's that guy doing, I wonder?"

I still got orange and white cassette tapes
Tents where my neighbor came to spectate
Niggas that’s tough now used to get little in the dark
It’s all cool now, we’re all little kids at heart
Accident prone Chance, y'all remember 'bout
The time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda’s House
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos
From Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cellphones
Rocked your world, fourth grade talent show
Jada and Justin’s birthday magic show
Games of tips taking niggas to school
Two quarters and I’ll bust your ass at pool, on bull
Round here we lose best friends like every week
I like to think we playin a long game of hide and go seek
And one day maybe I’ma find Terrance and I could lead them
Kids of the Kingdom singing about freedom

Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God

Let’s take it back like Indian givers
To Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets
To the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings
To puffy wintercoats and Christmas mornings
I used to chill with the kids next door
And SpongeBob came around 'bout four
And then I’d hang with Bart’s guys
Around the bend was Smart Guy
Flipping through the picture books
Checking through my archives
Remember the old days, the ones you’ll never get back
At the end of parties, passing around gift bags
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back
MY$FITS and mismatch that get off like wrist slaps, uhh

Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my God

Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl
Mama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa
Booster seat used to boost my kitty, Connie's Pizza
And every year we made a Christmas list
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish
Like “Lord, let me see another year like this”, uhh

Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my God
Hey Ma, hey Ma, hey Ma
Hey Ma, hey Ma, hey Ma

I said 'Hey Ma', don't go stretching your wallet
These niggas gotta pay me for taking a year from college
Go on get ya nails polished, stylist for your eyelids
And a pilot for your mileage for them frequent flights to your island
Ms. Brown and Ms. Pollock, little boy done grown up
Little voice done blown up, middle-class that bonus
Hey Ma, Hey Mama Jan; God just gave me another chance
Rod just gave me another line, probably gave me another fan
7-7-3, Oh, since Kanye was a three-old
Down the street from D. Rose, was practicing his free-throws
Shout out to that Gulf Shrimp, shout out to King Gyro
Shout out that Ms. Moody, auntie Toni them my heroes

Never got good grades a lot

And go in stores and take a lot
And never shopped but saved a lot

Save Money, my patna dem
I'm part of them, It's part of me
This Save Mula, Bo squad III

Hot boxing no cops around

Just had a show, just had to bounce
It's Chance ho, #10Day
Chano no hable ingles

Muy caliente
So she just gonna throw her steps on
And haters gonna throw that epsom
And we just gonna throw a party

But twin bro be that Victor

I hope y'all had a good time
IGH!
Yep, igh! igh! igh!

I got suspended, ooohh you got suspended
For chiefin' a hunnid blunts, 14,400 minutes
Fans all in the stands, they hands for Mr. Bennett
That racket over the net, ooohh give me my tennis
Shoes, give me a minute, ooohh I can't be tardy
My class is already started, they told my mom I'm retarded
But that 10Day done in one night, Honda from a Hyundai
No tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni
They took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there
An inch away from Heaven, a million songs from right here
A step away from South by, a swing away from Cali
A hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping
So at the school they arrested him
Back seat, squad car, nestled in
Shouts to the bitch nigga Heselton
Wit' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'
Finna see the 10Day Pestilence
So far, so good, so special and
No stars, good jobs, or excellents
And I'm still so fucking non-echelon
Ooohh you got suspended, ooohh you not gon' finish
Ooohh you look familiar, ooohh you look like Kenneth
Damn they gon' resent it, ooohh you representin'
A class of bad kids, 14,400 minutes, ahhh!

IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH! (Ayy)

It just don't get better
It don't get better
It just don't get no better

It don't get no better
It don't get no
It don't get no better
It just don't get no better

I hate my bed, I hate my home, I hate my job
I hate the wife, I hate the kids, I hate the dog
I hate the sun, I hate the rain, I hate the clouds
I hate the TV, hate the dinner, hate the couch
I hate the car, I hate the bus, I hate the road
I hate the bar, I hate to drink, I hate to smoke
I hate a stranger, hate his boss, I hate his friend
I hate the womb, I needed room, I ate my twin
I hate my hands, handshakes, pancakes, milkshakes
Child-resistant locks on the pill case
I hate inflation, hate the store, I hate to choose
I hate the war, I hate the poor, I hate the news
I hate the late, I can't be early, hate to wait
I hate my lovers cause the way they suffocate
I fuck to hurt, it hurt to date, I hate to date
I fuck to hate, I hate to love, I hate to hate

And it just don't
And it just don't
And it just don't

It don't get no better
It don't get no
It don't get no better
It just don't get no better

I hate to lose, I hate to try, I hate to win
I hate to cruise, I hate to fly, I hate to swim
I hate the optimistic smirks on the face of children
I hate the government and those who deface its buildings
I hate artists, hate creatives, I hate bright people
I hate darkness, I hate racists, I hate white people
I hate small speakers, I hate loud speakers
I hate great concerts, I don't like crowds neither
I hate money, I hate change, I hate hope
I hate funny, I hate strange, I hate dope
I hate charities and parodies and tragedies
I hate carrots, peas, asparagus
Virtually all vegetables, circuses, all festivals
Texts that are oversexual, motion because it's perpetual
I hate schedules, calendars, reminders cause' they just remind us That tomorrow gon' be just as timeless
I fuckin' hate you

And it just don't
And it just don't
And it just don't

It don't get no better
It don't get no
It don't get no better
It just don't get no better
Ice, melting in my chain
Pretty as my hair
Ugly as my name
Dirty as my gold
Comfy as my chair
Ugly is my name
Ugly is my name

No weapon formed against me shall prosper
My sword look just like Michael's
He lent it to me, this a house of God
I'm just leasing, he rent it to me
This sentence he penned it too
That's a Gmail, he sent it to me
I can send you his contact, hit him if you in combat
Hit him if you in traffic, even if there ain't no static
That's my G, he got me shinin'
My hair, he made it tangled
My seed, don't need no lining
A halo fits on an angel
And if the shoe fits, I'll tie his and let the kiddie rap
Finally give the city back, and ask God for a piggy-back
Up on his shoulders I notice, I'm within earshot
I yell, "Thanks for makin' us in your image
You got a good sense of hubris"
Sparring is training
Chain snatching the slaves
But a rap song is a match in a cave
Dim lit, wet wick, wicked wrath in its way
Drunk off of light, lies, laughing
Claiming asylum while shying in shade
I can't stay silent, I go violent when my violets is gray
And my roses is black
Fuck the pharaohs and pharisees, Moses is back
I don't need to see a Sphinx to know they noses was black
I don't know one temptation that had Otis' back
Sparring is training this a jumping jack
I'm the scariest jack in the pumpkin patch
Float like my jumper wet, sting like a bumblebee
I swing like a lumber jack, go back when I'm up at bat
They tried to label me a non-rapper
I'm an independent contractor
Card cracker, sparring is training without the training wheels
You made it, you made it, you made it, yeah, you made a deal
You played it straight, hated, graduated, waited, waited
You still a waiter still
Mice will always find out ways to steal
Picture me, fifth of Hennessy and the swisher sweet
Fake identity, 'til a plug named Trinity shook me
"Wake up, wake up" like remember me?
Said one plus one make three, and you finna see
You ain't as grown as you finna be
You got them young nigga tendencies

Sentimental energy
I let the light in beside him, I stand like angel
Sparring is training for an apathetic halo
Apologetic, non religious, consequential fable
Like good is good, the love in me is goodly or godly
The Bible say mistakes is necessary
So I Mississippi monologue to granny house
My soloist is sold out to attentive God
Cornbread on my table when I say my prayers
On airs, to stairs where shadiness is time to rest or manifest
Sparring is training, I know they think me bumblebee
Afro-Americano Sunny D
But bet I sting, no die

Sparring is training

Jacob wrestled with God, in the desert 'til he broke him
And he blessed him and he rescued his heart
I struggle with love, I juggle my loves
I cuddle and coddle, ship wreckin' bottle, I huddle in hugs
Sparring is training bra, Ramses watching raining frogs
Jigga watching Damon, Damon watching Wayans Bros
A tandem unicycle with two pilots in different maps

You giving back?
(I'm giving back)
Tit for tat

Synagogue and bottle caps
A body in the underpass says, where's my Jesus?
Pledge allegiance to the money now
We runnin down to kiddie parks where darker kids be casualty
Like come with me, to the museum

Excuse them, they know of what they do

Sparring is training,don't let Denzel Training Day you
Sensei could catch a fade too
We be onnat elegant hella melanin
Pelle Pelle's since they crayons and jelly pens

And now you know Noname ain't never for none
(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)
And now you know Noname ain't never for none
(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)
Aha, and you don't stop
Boom bap, and you don't stop
I told you that was gonna be fun though
Fuck with me y'all
I mean either way you stuck with me y'all
I'm coming at these rap niggas first
And for most that's unluckily y'all
Better know it
Just a mustard seed dog that I ever really needed
Nigga's just tryna see Jesus
Sipping water like it come with different cheeses
All of your opinions facetious, it's feces
I got a thesis or slick dissertation
Our entire species is young and impatient and passive
All at the same damn time, why? Chi to kill them with kindness
Hit them with the Visine, try to cure the blindness
Couple coffee beans for the sinus
Folgers the best part of waking up
Is the alignment of self with God, and that isn't for a selfish heart
My intention was to flood the scene
I don't ever really hug the scene
Y'all know I been submarine with this shit
Little more Actavis how I lean with this shit
Black as hell, still the cream of this crop
With dream, no king just Ving Rhames with six shots
It's the dawn of the dead and I feel so alive
And the free been in here you can tell by my mind, like

You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way risen, you haven't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy, you just a...
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way up, you steady talking that shit
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy, you just a...

Lazy male complaining about how in high school he could, but his ACL
Ay be clear, this my daddy house, you just the uncle from ATL
(Better take out that trash)
Boy get your big....grown ass on
Old ass home, broke ass drinking up all the milk
But can't do no laundry, e-Harmony romance on
Watch your tone folk, talking to grown folk
Yeah, yeah, get that bass out your voice, you were sounding like Tone Lōc
Now watch how I move, different chapters
Decisions, missions, visit pastors
Everybody finally can say it out loud, "My favorite rapper a Christian rapper"
And he got fate in his faith in his soul
And a tape, and a cape and that drape from out west
To the lake and it cover his face like a Bape
And I hate when I wait but it never come late
From tobacco back roads to bus seat back rows
A Black boy, black rose, back rolls
Men grow just as surely as mountains peak and plateaus plateau, ya kna wha' mean?

You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way risen, you haven't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy
Boy you just a...

Kinda crazy how it fall up in your lap right?
Shit was determined in a past life
If you ask nicely, mad, nice
Even with mad lights you couldn't see the boy
Up in class like I'm only half right, they ain't believe the boy
Wave when you pass them, moments you should bask in
Wonder if the Lord's on my side, let me ask him, or ask her
I don't need a password, don't ask about my past word
Living until my last words, wondering if this music got the slash in
Don't forget the cash and mix in with the passion, oh
If I don't feel the love then I'mma pass end
Shit is everlasting, I'mma have a blast and uh
I'mma have a good day, I'mma stay zonin'
I might get high as shit or I might stay sober
Might roll a J and I might just pass it
Might hit the Bay and I might trip acid
They tried to treat us like some bummy little sneakers
I tell 'em "When you dream, make sure that you dream big"
You could be cool and an Uber driver
The next minute you in Aruba, you scuba divin'
I hope they sell you the truth and that you survivin'
Don't do how they gon' scrutinize 'em
And looking at the youth, tryna euthanize 'em
If it was up to you they would nuke the projects

Get up off that bed, big fella
You a grown boy, big fella
You need your diaper change, big fella
You still catching a bus nigga and living at mom's crib, big fella
You been tryna get money
You only got ten singles in your pocket, big fella
Get up now, big fella, find you a job
Still playing Xbox 360, you ain't even got an Xbox One
You got a PS one and an Xbox 360, big fella
Go find you a job, today, right now, big fella
The sun is almost gone, big fella
Get up now, big fella
(...playin' yourself like a toy
Boy you just a...)
Get up, big fella
What is you doing?
You been sleeping all day, big fella
You ain't even got no pillows or no cover or no sheets on your bed, big fella
It's time to find another hustle, big fella
That scamming ain't cutting it, big fella
Get up now
Get up, get up, get up, big fella
Happy Holidays

She could say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is hand made, pan fried, sun dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church

You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy

Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)

I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church

Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)

Mama you know, Mama you know its gonna rain
Father you know
Promised, you said it would rain, finally I'm home
You left on the light when I left on the flight, but I made it alright
I've been waiting all week, I've been waiting all night
Jason Van Dyke
Had to say something on Saturday
See you at Church on Sunday
Open Mike coming on Monday
I wonder what the internet gonna say
When SNL end with the Indie
Then the third tape slide down the chimney
Via Kirsten, Kinsley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy, Austin win the Emmy, Mama Jan too

Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Momma you know it's gone rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile

I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy’s a long way from red dogs and green rangers
Things ain’t been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don’t think I felt ya hand on my head yelling “Call his father”
But people don’t hear ghosts so how they gon' play me
Money saved me so I’ma do the same thing
You droppin pounds, gettin small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don’t know how to use a stick shift
You better not miss this, overdose, dope and mixes
Let ya throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it
Blast off...

Dropping tapes 'til I losted count, coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling I’m Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I’m jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib I’m falling down
Yeah, I'm steady crawling 'round
I’m calling out to God
Your little angels falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around

Oh non je t'en prie, nous ne sommes pas chez nous
Oh je t'assure que ce n'est pas grave
Non laisse moi!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as aujourd'hui?
J'ai que les hommes me dégoûtent. Vous ne pensez qu'à ça

Well it’s been a long time, long time now
Since I’ve seen you smile
And I’ll gamble away my fright
And I’ll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well it’s been a long time, long time now
(Oh it’s, oh it’s been so long)
Since I’ve seen you smile
(It’s been so long)

Said it’s been a long time, long time now, now, now
Said it’s been a long time, long time now
And it’s been a long time, long time now
This is six blunt rotation music
This is just got off six month probation music
This is steppin' on the beach
When you're too drunk to feel a beat
This that laughing in a condo
Throwin' shit down in the street
This that shouts to the Ave, shouts to the lab
Shouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags
This for every math class that I ever had
So fuck you if I failed, and fuck you if I passed!
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past
Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class
Some of us is seeing summer, some of us have passed
Some of us ain't seeing summer, some of us have passed
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass
Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave
We on the ground yelling, "Give my nigga back!"

And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down

Another weekend full of blunts and brews
Too comfortable, yelling "Fuck a school"
Ain't seen the world before noon in like a month or two
Blunts to the face, bottles to the dome
Niggas never need no cup
Livin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up
Ridin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks
In the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal
Tryna get a million
Just ridin' around with my niggas and them
Real white nigga man mean real appeal
We go all out 'til we fall out
Niggas get called out then hauled out
With the windows down we like to smoke all out
Drink 'til I fall out, fuck is you tahm bout boy
The Village is my brothers
It's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'
Hella love for Chance The Rapper
We know 10 Day is a classic, on God

And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down

This is for sand in my shoes, shout out to Oak Street
For the free train rides, shout out to Polk Street
To the ice cream man you just on hella dirt
How you don't see us can't hear us, you Helen Keller
But I'mma save my dollars for Mary Jane and embellish her
Inhalin' her, smellin' her, maybe sellin' her
You niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Helliker
But that's my homie, my dude be droppin' hella verses
So, shouts to D.O.C. and Nu Tribe too
Man we out this jam, see how new guys do
But its still save money like a coupon
So you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on

And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you

Cassius Clay at his head, atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need a Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking what up, I said on my soul I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end
The others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands
My momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting
I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas
I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I’m going to war with fate and I’m going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers cuz all the reporters lied
I call him my lil homie he brought him a .45
Brown boys are dying, and none of ‘em were for business
And all of em' love they mommas, and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
(And now for something completely different)

Waking up in grind mode and sleeping in a grindhouse
So please don't hit my line 'bout the party trying to find out
What time that shit going to start
Or when it end, or who gone come out
Or if I walked the stage
I've been on stage since I could rhyme out
Shows and shows and tapes
Of trying to get my fucking lines out
So please don't take my BIC out, my book out, my pick out
My hair, my fucking big mouth, you dick head you dipped out
Of class and now you shit out of luck, who fucking slick now
And with them rhymes you written down
I hope you get a mix down
With a diss track from Ms. Rownd
And my dick sack in this bitch mouth
Give a five-hive to my teacher face

You ain't nothing but my seedling, I'll hang you from the ceiling
And leave yo' little ass leaking, and leave yo' body stinking
Dude yo' ass been drinking? Or you just wasn't thinking?
I'll hit you with that 6-piece: bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink!
I hear you're pockets jingling
It's calling me like "ring, ring!"
I'll choke you with your bling bling
Then run faster than Tink Tink
And all these goofies mad though
Like, "Why he such a asshole?"
And I ain't even mad yo, I'll stab you with a screwdriver
That shit ain't even rhyme nigga
I'm fucked up out my mind nigga
I stay right off the '9 nigga
That's where they try an' find a nigga
Feeling froggy? Better timid up
Harsh feelings gone, put 'em in a blunt
Cause niggas don't wanna get bended up
Stay talking but don’t send it up
Used to send it up for my skinner lunch
Save money niggas really won't spend a buck
Gimme that cash, that ben what up
Pockets keep that denim bruh like ahh

Nigga, fuck you talm bout? Fuck you talm bout?

I get sad when I look at the stars
They so pretty, you can't tell 'em apart
You think they close but really we far
And really, they ain't even that much closer to God
It's much harder to sin naked
I walked past apple trees and didn't take it
I thought about stone mattresses, thin blankets
Really long winters spent in a windbreaker
I'm a temptation door-knocker, down there on Lower Wacker
I'm a rich excuse for a father, you just can't tour a toddler
She turnin' 2, she don't need diapers, she just need her papa
I really need a break, could really use a nap
My daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat
You go so far, you hit a point where you can't Uber back
The other day, I told a hummingbird he too relaxed
I did my worst, I did the work, I had to skip the label
I go to church, they want a flick, I want to flip the table
I knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable
And now it's just a fable, and it's just as fatal

First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes, yeah
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes

Here it comes
Alright
Spirit's working now

I think my little cousins want they cousin back
The automatic quarterback that doesn't rap
They know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles
Lied about coming back, the last straw that broke the camel
It ain't really fun to hang out with me no more
We can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more
It's messed up, I made it this way, and my feet so sore
But it's all downhill from here, I could teach snowboards
I miss my mom, I miss my time, I miss my prime
In high school, I missed my prom, I ditched my date, I missed my beat
Kissed my teeth, kicked my feet, hooped and hollered
Now I just sip my tea, sit my ass on my ass
Send my tweet, fold my arms, twist my weed
If I hadn't heard the news, I would've known what he say
But the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake, you know

First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes

Three verses, hell yes
I still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet
I just want my mama happy like a toy sale
And to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail
I hear the seams snappin', and I'm the team captain
No more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin'
'Til the dream happens, I'm just gon' keep rappin'
And y'all just keep clappin' and keep actin' like
Flint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters
And black friends and gay cousins, y'all just gon' say nothin'
Know that the day comin', knees bowed, tongues confessin'
The last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings

Now these the first world problems that niggas make up
Keep on playin', we gon' shake this shit up
Keep on tellin' us we makin' it up
The American Dream, may you never wake up

The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes,  ready or not, ready or not
Ready or not,  ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it will not wait another day
No more, no more (it's on its way, way, yeah)
The day is on its way, I cannot wait, here it's to stay
No more, no more (it won't wait, yeah)
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it is
22 Offs...
I'm off the nog, I'm off the Loko
I'm off that local, I'm on that global
I often had dreams of being locked in my momma's Volvo
Watching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo
I'm off the top, I'm off some pot, I'm off Ciroc
I'm off a lot, they gave me 10 Days off
That's an awful lot, I was off campus, but the officer
Told the office, that he saw me from the parking lot
But it's all good, I'm off that
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave while rocking all black
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot
Just to make sure that I don't get caught
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off
They told me go on and rock it, I told them that it's lift off
How all my homies get caught, picked off by a dick cop
Why you allowing hiccups, why you just didn't slip off?
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares
You gon' torture me yeah? Well that's awfully fair
All for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years
Bitch I ain't scared, I'm already here
Tell ya partners and ya friends, the next coffin is theirs
Guess what bitch, I'm from internal affairs
Looking for crooked cops, to tweak so I can offer 'em years
Have me tweaking, like I'm all full of fear... alright, I'm tweaking
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
IGH!
Nana naaaaa
Yup
Wooooh, ah!
Nanana

Young black boy, how he got the labels scared?
A&R's like, "Chano, you ain't playin' fair!
You gon' set a bad example for the average bear
You a Yogi, you should idle while in child's position"
I be like, naw, these my sons, this prenatal care
I'mma show em how to make it here and make it fair
Take it there, they could kill me and I ain't gon' care
You is just an ankle weight, lighter than some angel cake
Sweeter than some maple syrup, easier than Ableton
Make a plate and make a player
Make em play it
Just don't count your sheep before they hatch
You chickens 'fore your eggs
Eat your dinner 'fore you say your prayer

I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this...

Young tactician, just got my taxes finished
Beat the tortoise by a hair in an '04 Ford Taurus
On a spare with a wax finish
There's a lot of metaphors, you just lack vision
You just bad business
UH!
All your shit been lower case
Lower class, lower key
I'm the only minor minority in priority
Sippin' gin and tonic while I plot upon authority
Author of my horoscope, feeling like the oracle
Ain't no rules, nigga
IGH!

I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this...
Chance The Rapper, Caleb
10 Day, ohh! Igh!

She working that thang, she know she got it
Lil mama so bad, you know she naughty
Her do it so slow, now watch her take it
She giving a show, now watch her break it

Back it up like, "juke juke", 3, 4, "juke juke"
Hands on the tracks like "choo-choo"
Can't nobody do it like you do
True, true, mama sip a little bit of the screw juice
Or a little bit of that Special K
And throw it in the bowl like fruit loops
Hola, mami chula
Mami hol'up, mami slow up
'Scuse my French, my lingo but I no hable cinco
Her girlfriends say they bout it, you know that I'm bilingual
And Chano gonna mingle, I'm off a couple pintos
The bad hoes out on Saturday, it's church on domingo
So while they out her frontin' go on back it for your mans
Cause even when your friends actin' funny you gon' dance like

She giving a show, now watch her break it

Bust it, bust it, wide open, open

She from lowend oh and, went to Kenwood? Me too
Nah I'm lyin', she say she got somebody bitch, me too
I hope that that shit do work out man
Cause this that new 'New Workout Plan'
And I'm that dude, you heard bout
And I hope that get your shirt off and if not
Keep on dancin' babe, all I need is that preview
Put you on the floor and show them niggas how to freak you
Slow whine, slow grind
On time, you can take your own time
But if I can't hit your ass on time
Gotta hit me online, you can't hit my phone line

I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy’s a long way from red dolls and green rangers
Things ain’t been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don’t think I felt your hand on my head yelling, “Call his father”
But people don’t hear ghost, so how they gon' play me?
Money saved me, so I’ma do the same thing
You droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don’t know how to use a stick shift?
You better not miss this, overdose dope and mix this
Let your throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it

Long time now since I seen you smile
Long time long time now, since I seen you smile
And it's been a long time, long time now
Since I seen you smile

Dropping tapes 'till I lost the count
Coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling, I’m Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I’m jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowds
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib I’m falling down
I'm on the floor crawling 'round
I’m calling out to God, "You’re little angel's falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around"

Long time long time now, since I seen your smile
We miss you

#10Day
It's been a really, really long time, long time
Since a goof ass nigga done tried me
Label niggas wanna sign me
And lame ol' nigga wanna buy me
Food and weed and drink and shit
Just as long as you inkin shit
Sometimes I can't pay for food
Cause sometimes I can't think of shit
Where's your head at? Where's your head at?
Singing my shit like you just said that
Wanging my shit like where'd you hear that?
Young ass nigga where you headed? Long time to get famous
Life's whatever you make it, just thank God that we made it
Shawty, she got the body
She did the molly
Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy, she extra choppy
Just did the potty
I love that bitch, the perfect thottie
The perfect thottie
Shawty, she got the body
She did the molly
Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy, she extra choppy
Just did the potty
I love that bitch, the perfect thottie
The perfect thottie

You are the prototype
I love you like you love your photo likes
When you post your life
Some of these hoes just wanna Instagram me
You out here trying to win you an Instagrammy
Instant pancakes in the morning
Aunt Jemima try to Andre Benjamin me
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, but your daughter do dicks
Wouldn't be my old bitch if you taught her new tricks
But she do do the one thing, with her tongue ring
When she bust like a gun range
I had a couple pics, record her out her panties
But, that's just chump change
She the type of bitch that loves to say she's mixed
But when she say the roster she always say "Black last"
You know who you is and you know what it is
I love you with your black ass
You helpless thing, wish you gave me more head
And have way more self esteem
But I wish she gave me way more head
Way more then I ever gave a fuck about your self esteem

Shawty, she got the body
She did the molly
Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy, she extra choppy
Just did the potty
I love that bitch, the perfect thottie
The perfect thottie
Shawty, she got the body
She did the molly
Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy, she extra choppy
Just did the potty
I love that bitch, the perfect thottie
The perfect thottie

Got it locked, I got lots of keys
Fuck nigga don't start with me
Oh my god, oh my god I’m a novelty
At least that’s what she said when she swallowed menovelty
Your bitches had the ball, my bitches pass the ball
And this dick is a gift for that love degree, hey
Heard you graduating, girl congratulations
This ain't prom but can I take you home as if your fam was waiting
At the front door with that 44 cocked

Shawty, she got the body
She did the molly
Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy, she extra choppy
Just did the potty
I love that bitch, the perfect thottie
The perfect thottie
Shawty, she got the body
She did the molly
Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy, she extra choppy
Just did the potty
I love that bitch, the perfect thottie
The perfect thottie
Heads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham
Dear Father, guide all my brothers away from Sam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
Shake that jam
Heads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham
Dear Father, guide all my brothers away from Sam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam

Chance The Rapper, song singer, senior, bong steamer
Light up hot wheels, locked up, wrong steamer
Dreamer, long Beemers, our neighbors their, lawns greener
We wrestle with envy then act up, John Cena
Chancellor Bennett, referred to as word chemist
The bourbon and slurred sentences is turning up burning bridges
Cigarette stained smile, all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
Getting hyped up off them bad bitches on it
Getting knocked up off a nigga, bad luck
Getting scared now with them IRS audits
All the tax money that I didn’t add up
That I didn’t get yet, but they think that I got it
Keep a long shirt so they think that I got it
And if they all dummy and a nigga get bodied
It was really, really ill, I know a nigga held up
Hell yeah I’ll always get a pic with y’all niggas
Word to my fans, all six of y'all niggas
I seen all the tweets and the tips from y’all niggas
Got hands for them niggas that pick on y'all niggas
Loving your love, an album to come
I bet that you love it, comes out in a month
Chance, the astounding class clown
That turned out to amount into something, 3001

I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up

Knock knock said the fist to the world
Shine sun through the mist and debris
Bang bang said the fist to the young
Silence from the lips of the free
Say something important, say something important
Make money the end of the week
But that shit coming soon, I’m getting hungry
Might sell out in a couple of weeks
But my crib they buckin’
And they just called Buddy, that’s lil bro
Even though last time we spoke
We was arguing, but we still stay close
Ask God to watch the squad
On God, battle niggas to the death, alright
Fuck your squad and the whole facade
I ain’t never scared of where a nigga reside
Extra mild sauce on the side, extra mileage on the ride
Express, I'mma grab my chain
Cause it’s extra violence all on the nine
Ten days, that’s an awful lot
Eleven squares in like fifteen minutes
Sixteens when that album comes
Spit twelve real quick for a listening picnic, igh!

I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up

If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam

It could be (It could be, it could be everyday)
Everyday (It could be wonderful)
Everyday, it could be (It could be)
It could be wonderful (It could be wonderful)
Wonderful (It could be)
Hey
Everyday (Everyday)
It could be wonderful
It could be wonderful everyday (Everyday)
Everyday, it could be, everyday (It could be wonderful, wonderful)
Hey, it could be everyday (It could be everyday)
It could be (Everyday it could be wonderful)
(It could be wonderful everyday)
(Everyday could be so wonderful, it could be)

Everyday when you're walking down the street (Wonderful)
Everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view
(Everyday, everyday it could be wonderful)
And I say hey! (Everyday)
Heyyy! (Everyday, everyday, it could be wonderful)
(Everyday, everyday it could be wonderful, wonderful
It could be so wonderful
Everyday it could be, it could be
It could be wonderful, wonderful
Heyyy! (Everyday, everyday, everyday)
(It could be wonderful)
It could be (It could be wonderful)
It could be wonderful (Everyday, it could be wonderful)
It could be wonderful, everyday (It could be wonderful)
(It could be so wonderful)
(It could be, everyday)

It's a simple message
And it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself
For that's the place to start

And I said Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day
We can learn to work and play
Get along with each other

Listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes
Open up your ears
Get together and make things better
By working together


I'm gonna get by when the going get rough
I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up
And when I go down
I'mma go down swinging
My eyes still smiling
And my heart still singing
Yolo nigga, yolo everything
Yolo car, yolo car radio
Look me up in the yolo pages nigga, igh

Hey, Ya! When the fuck you gonna grow up?
When that money gonna show up?
Thought that 10 Day shit would blow up
Got you stressed, ripping your 'fro up
Smokin' squares, fuckin' your throat up
And a nigga from your iPod in the party and they know ya
And your teachers wanna claim ya, they critically acclaim ya
Used to criticize your mistakes, "Mr. Bennett's Mr. Famous"
Mrs. Rownd just heard your mixtape, "the misogynistic mischief"
You the reason for the mishaps, and should keep coming up missing
You're a top dog; you the top, dog
They can't even catch up; you so hot, dog
And it feels good, and it feels dope
You still steal shit, cause you still broke
And you really wanna drop, really really hot
Shit that they really wanna cop, but they wouldn't give a fuck
If you won a Grammy, if you end up in the Hall of Rock
Then you end up in a hole from a hammy to the top
Got 99 problems, got a 100 to the drugs
I should finish up this verse, but you know I don't give a fuck
YOLO!

Yo-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, YOLO (x5)

Shouts out my juice, bitch, my cup runneth over
Bout now them suits fit, my cuffs button golden
So bitch suck my dick, igh, bitch, suck my dack
I been riding 'round in that steamer with that steamer in my lap
I swear I used to give a fuck, but now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? What do you think of fuck fest?
You ever had a foursome? You ever been a suspect?
You ever passed the fuck out? You ever failed a drug test?
I learned from getting bumped that bumping Ye could make it be okay
All that jumping, dunking shit can't make a 3 go way
I been up inside the stu' for fucking three whole days
Yelling, "Fuck the cops, it ain't nothing to box"
So somebody pour me another shot like SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS
SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, Drop, drop, drop, drop
Give a fuck, fuck that-that Is you going, dot, dot, dot?
Like a lot, lot, lot, lot, do the fop, bop, bop, bop
Don't stop, stop, stop, stop
Yooooo Yooooo Yoooo
Will we continue on
String along
We need time
Yooooo Yooooo Yoooo
Will we continue on
String along
We need time

You reach into the bowl of car keys
Making eye contact, as if to say 'hows that"
Are you fucking happy now
Grab his wrist and wriggle past me
As Jenny licks her lips
Time to teach a young dog tricks
And how to bow
Remember when you couldn't hurt me
We reached a breaking point
As you lit your joint and we crossed the severn bridge
For the addy and your cold out, splow me out
Again

And you kiss him
And I kiss her
And I love her
We all go home again

She know my favorite flavor skittles
She know everything we argue 'bout
Where everything in our crib at
And every time you walk up out
She know whenever we fighting and whenever we cool
But my favorite thing she know is that she'll never be you
She know she'll never have her song, She know she'll never have my son
She know she'll never have your pain, she'll never have to have a hunch
She know everyone that I lie about, heard every freaking word
She know everything you wonder bout, and it hurt her even worse
Who'd you rather be?
All
All, all, all
All the things
All the things, things
All that glitters is not gold
All, all, all, and all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me
How's everybody doing?

We were all that matters, family's all that matters
This is just business, see you right after
Nothing comes before ya, nothing else matters
All of this is for ya, you are all that matters

I dance around the darkness down on Billie Jean Road
If I ain’t toured then we still’d be broke
Thought I got the formula, bon appetite
I got a beat in case my baby baba ever leak
Wise beyond my years but way behind my peak
You gotta eat, this a step to my princess
Point of interest, fourth and inches
Hallelujah, the kid grew up, the crowd cheered the child
Booya, mic drop, I walk home

I don't care about, they don't mean a thing (All, all)
All these fancy things (All, all)
I'll tell you that all, my weight in gold (All)
All I know, I know (And all gold is not reality)
All these things
All these things
All these things
All these things

In this part of my life, I'm growing up and I- and I wanna, I wanna do this the right way, go, go out of it, grow out of it, in the best way possible, so thank you guys who's been there thus far, and it's only gonna get better...

I don't care bout, they don't mean a thing
All these fancy things
I'll tell you that all, my weight in gold (All that glitters, glitters)
All I know, I know (Is not gold, Igh!)
All these things (All that matters)
All these things (All, all that matters)
All these things (You are all that matters)
Thanks for filming this
I wrote this for you today

I got the baddest chick on the planet
She ain't mixed but folks be askin' if she half Hispanic
She complain about the baby weight but I ain't panicked
Since she got pregnant she been showin' crack like bad mechanics
I rub her feet, I put in work like I was Robyn Fenty
The only chick that I hold as much is probably Kinsley
I sit with her and watch Black Ink and Being Mary
But never Love & Hip Hop, that shit get kinda scary
She stand about six feet, she used to hoop at 'Lane
I tried to stick her the other day and got my ankle sprained
I fell deep, tried to leave, but you know the way that you learn best
Is leavin' out the garage and get hit with that U-turn text
So if you got a girl and she sexy and she grown
Stay your ass at home 'fore you end up all alone
Leave the toilet seat down, always keep your phone
Ask my BM, she got her own ringtone, and she was singing...
I've got a lady, a lady friend
I've got a lady friend
I've got a lady and that lady is my
I've got a lady, I've got, I've got a lady
And that lady is my friend
I've got, I've got a lady for a friend

I'm your buddy, I'm your little bro
I'm a stuffed animal
I'm a cuddle, not a dildo
I'm a love anecdote
Was I always taller than ya?
Will I always call ya back?
I'mma always wrongly answer
Always almost caught ya trap
Imaginary beneficiary been away for so long, Ben & Jerry friend
Few compliments and a tear wipe
I'm the best man you're not marrying
And you know they ask about you, "What's up with your lady?"
I tell 'em, "You're just, you're just, you're just gorgeous"
You're just a lady friend, a lady friend

For a friend, for a friend
What would you do?
For for a friend
What would you do for a friend?
