Any nigga that ever looked at me wrong, (ha!) hey man, go that way B
Hey, man, I'm done holdin' back on you niggas, man, straight up, man
Y'all niggas better to go watch Montana 300 1 through 14 or something man, this 15

I been ballin
Could've skipped college
I'm a bad boy with that big popper
12 gauge when I head shot him
Bust his head open like a pinata
Like Percy Miller I've been bout it
Come find your ass like Bin Laden
I kill a clown over my guala
Don't give a fuck if it was 10 dollars
Don't trust niggas don't trust bitches
I know these ho's like a pimp scholar
And it's MOB till the day I drop
And these stupid thots don't get nada
And these dick riders try to steal from me
Gon feel the heat when that lead pop em
I whack a bitch and then walk away with blood on my shoes that's red bottoms
Bought a new gun with two clips
I can't wait to use it
And that bitch stick to my hip like I glued it
I hope you do trip as soon as you do it
I'll pull that bitch out K-9 unit
And kiss your ass goodnight, like, (bang bang) that's smooches
No top that's clueless
I'm ruthless, I do this
I'm ballin these ho's, yeah, they all on my pool stick
And you mad at your main bitch cause that bitch bumpin my new shit
Yeah the game foul and the ref dirty
Keep the green on me like a jets jersey
Tell a opposition I ain't never worried
Keep the 30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
I can see you pussy like a miniskirt
Keep talkin you gon get it first
And the toughest with you gon' get it worst
Now go order up about 20 shirts
RIP with they face on it, had to show they ass how that semi work
Yeah they got smoked April 21st
The next time you see 'em gon' be in a hearse
Always sayin somethin' but ain't sprayin nothin'
When it's beef I don't wait for nothin'
If I see a opp broad day in public
Then I'm shootin shit like Azae Production
Got word they be out there every night
I'm talking deeper than Barry White
We gon' ride past with that iron blast
And start flipping niggas like Jessie White
They catching bullets, he Randy Moss, he Terrell Owens, he Jerry Rice
And I'm fucking monster in a pair of Mike's and this 40 on me looks very nice
I roll up like a blunt, I don't lurk bitch I hunt
Hoodie on like a monk, I'm Boyz-N-Tha-Hood with that pump
This bitch got kicked like a punt it usually sit in my trunk
But for today it's riding shotgun since niggas like to front
And if this nigga run and this nigga done, I'ma soak a nigga like he in the tub
These rappers acting like Ice Cube now tell Doughboy to come pick him up
Fuck niggas I never like 'em, got no problem with killin' one
I do real hits and don't brag about it, just rap about it, I don't give a fuck
I remember way back when we was broke, we was crying, momma high as hell
To us she was a loving mother but to other motherfuckers she was clientele
And I remember begging her to stop and every single night when I told her that
I'ma get big and buy a bunch of guns
And kill every nigga that done sold her crack
It's almost 20 years later, now she finally sober
But that was the shit that I prayed about
I thank God I made it out
Damn it feels good to go pick up my momma and take her out
Lil Tony got paper now all in my bank account, and it ain't shit to debate about
If you cross me like Jesus, I'll come back with heaters
Be outside your crib like we stakin' out
It's really fucked up in my city I'm sorry but I'm bout to add to the body count
I'll Rocky Part 4'em I'm rushin', show all you niggas exactly what I be 'bout
My choppas, they shit on them bitches, when spittin, I think they might got a potty mouth
I might come baseline like Kobe Bryant, did way back in '03 and then body yall
Keep runnin' your mouth I'ma run in your house
Paramedics they gonna' bring bodies out
I'm sonnin you niggas like J. Rock and word on the streets is that they done let Bobby out
Be strapped at the mall, strapped at the studio, you better be strapped at your momma house
When Montana hoppin' out, hollow tips poppin' out
I caught his ass takin' the garbage out
Moment of silence, text messages sent around my city, the moment they find it out
Black on black everything
We own black everything
That's the motto when we ridin' out
The ratchets stay on me, just know I was all me, whenever if ever you saw me out
Been playin' with iron, since the age of nine
Shoutout to my daddy he taught me how
My dad was a killer, my mom was an addict, a nigga grew up in a slaughterhouse
I am the one that they talk about
I am so cold that you might have to Thaw me out
That money be callin', I won't stop ballin', now I am up next like Jabari now
See niggas was sleepin' on me, but I just woke them up and they sayin' they sorry now?
I'm a dough stacking
Dope rapping, no lacking
Pole packing, Four blasting
Soul snatching, toe tagging, cold bastard
Better close your mouth or get a closed casket
Show you what I'm saying like closed captions
Put them in two, make them disappear, when I spit fire, that's old magic
I'll put the chopper to a nigga top, and then let it fly, Go-Go Gadget
Might fuck his bitch or say fuck this shit, and get straight face, that's no passion
I'm the illest nigga that you ever heard
I'm the flyest killer that you ever seen
If a fuck nigga ever jump stupid, I'ma catch a body like a trampoline
Bitch I'm Freddy Kruger in a hockey mask
About to kick door like karate class
Ask a nigga where he hide his stash
He better tell the truth like a polygraph
One false move and that shotty blast
Leave a nigga stiff like a body cast
And we don't know nothing about nothing nigga, we was out of town If somebody ask
Real shit, I'm a father first, my son's need me, I ain't bailing on them
Be with real niggas, doing real shit
If I get caught, I ain't telling on them
No tool, I ain't never going
Iron Man with that metal on him
Only God knows where the hell I'm going
Make a nigga wish he was never born
These niggas broke, put a brace on 'em
I'm super fly, put a cape on them
I'm upstairs up in Adrianna's throwing cake on them while they hate on them
From Chiraq, not Miami, but I'm wearing heat like I play for them
I'll come at night and put the nine on them
With the long clip, DeAndre Jordan, (DeAndre Jordan, DeAndre Jordan)
I'll come at night and put the nine to them
With the long clip, DeAndre Jordan
I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you
And whenever I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout spending my life with you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swear, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
You're sweeter than honey, and these other bitches ain't fly as you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you

You be my woman, my wife, I promise to love you for life
You got more juice than Sunny Delight

See, she make me think I can sing, make me forget that I rap
She cook me breakfast on the stove, I slide my dick in from the back
I'm in love with this bitch
While she ride this dick, I be rubbin' her tits
Sometimes I can't help it, I think to myself
Man, this pussy so good, I might cum in this bitch
Say yes or say no, the decision is yours
Was gettin' lots of bitches, now mission abort
I cut bitches off like umbilical cords
Now come ride this dick cause it's yours
I'm ridin' with you to wherever God take us
The haters can't break us, girl let's stack this cake up
I feel on your booty while you do your makeup
I make time for you just like my name was Jacob
I don't ever worry cause I think you worthy
Like, James left the game, and I hung up my jersey
It's DBC gang, yeah that's why I talk dirty
And every time we bangin', you bust like my .30

I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you
And whenever I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout spending my life with you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
You're sweeter than honey, and these other bitches ain't fly as you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you

I used to have lots of hoes, shawty thought I was a pimp
See, she fell in love with my stroke, she ain't know that I could swim
She throw that ass back for a G, she know she fuck with a boss
I love when she cum on my D, hop up and she lick it all off
Got me gravitatin' with infatuation
Had to cut em' off, baby, amputation
Made that cancellation for a damn queen
Now my hands clean, baby, sanitation
Colder than winter, don't wanna lose her
She a winner, my favorite place is up in her
Slide in like a splinter, might treat that pussy like dinner
Legs in the air like antennas
Then climb up on top like a wrestler, she down for the count
Hold her leg up whenever I pin her
I cut like a dealer, my baby cum, I cum with her
Take care of that box, I deliver, she wet like a river
She drippin', we lit like a candle
I'm thumbin' the clit like I'm flickin' through channels
We switch positions, I spank her with no paddle
I came on her back like a camel, she shake and I rattle

I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you
And whenever I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout spending my life with you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
You're sweeter than honey, and these other bitches ain't fly as you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you

My haters watch my videos, though I’m their aggravation
When haters see me, they always tell me congratulations
You showing love, knowing you hate me, boy that’s fabrication
I know you sick, but I’m gone ball just like a cancer patients
Couldn’t hold me down, don’t give a fuck if you was gravitation
Learn yo location and rotation, work those calculations
Run in yo spot then get you popped, cuz I ran out of patience
And caps gone fly around this bitch just like a graduation
This shit’s exclusive, straight up out the mental institution
I beat the track up, call for backup, man this shit abusive
Even his haters play it back, that’s how you know he dope
Like, “holy smokes, yo Tony’s flow just caught the Holy Ghost
My lines so dope if I continue, I might overdose
Pull out my dick, and tell my haters join the rodeo
It’s funny how you stay gettin’ money, but always sittin’ there
They tell me that I’m goin’ to hell, I tell ‘em I been there
30 bullets in my clip and bitch they all anxious
12 disciples with me nigga, and they all gangstas

We all know shorty blow that 40 like a fuckin’ sax

Man these dickriders never met me, yet they hatin’ still
They always blame the hottest one whenever they get killed
Ahhh! I guess now I know how Satan feel
You think you holier than thou, you must be fuckin’ proud
You go to church on Sunday like you really fucking down
You think that God don’t see yo dirt? boy you a fuckin’ clown

I’m back on that stupid shit, shootin’ shit believe that
Yo religion ain’t true as this
Pure common sense, boy that’s the thing that you lack
Just cause it’s published in a book, it doesn’t mean it’s a fact
Now listen, cause man we wasn’t allowed to read on them plantations
300 years, had my people growing impatient
Wanting to know what’s in that Bible and they can’t take it
Now let me tell you ‘bout the plan of a damn racist
Let’s teach these niggas love who hate ‘em so they can’t say shit
Whoever hits you, turn ya cheek, so they can’t face it
Edit the Bible before you show it to these L7’s

Still gripping on my pistol I ain't never lettin' go
And I can ride with my baby
I'm just at the mall I'm getting fire with my baby yeah
And no bitch fine as my baby
Pussy soaking wet can't wait to slide in my baby yeah
Looked in the eyes of my baby
And told her that I love her I'd die for you baby yeah
Bonnie and Clyde with my baby (uh huh)
Shawty down to ride, committing crimes wit my baby (hey, whats up, hello)
I remember back in the day when I was bagging up country
I started trapping for money now I'm rapping for money
They say I snap and go dumby it's a wrap like a mummy
Ain't gotta mack to the honeys that comes naturally to me
And bitch I carry Glocks I done buried ops
So pussy come and get your cherry popped
Bet I wet a nigga like a fucking pool
When I catch a body like belly flop
I'm poled up with bronem
Count show money at the Marriott
Like fuck a deal I'm already hot
I ball out no Fetty Wap
Some might sit and wonder like "why he be on that savage shit"
But they don't know the half of it
Growing up not having shit
Momma off of crack and shit I'm at school being bad as shit
In front of the projects bumping backward flips on matresses
Grew older, weight on shoulders I start hustling and baggin' zips
Whole time I was trapping I was mastering this rapping shit
With hopes our sons would never have to hustle like their daddys did
That's why I'm so passionate
I used to imagine it
I'm so talented I got niggas who hate me blastin' it
Planet of the apes me and broskinem tote banana clips
My partners posing pictures with pistols call that a action flick
I told 'em fuck proving to them pussy niggas we packing shit
And taking pictures with theyself snitchin' bro that's that backwards shit
Start whackin' shit the rest'll start vanishing like a magic trick
Who better than me your hypothesis is inaccurate
So it don't really matter your favorite rapper's inadequate
Cause once I get to snappin' immaculate meets extravagant
I'm Maximus, Achilles and Spartacus mixed with Gannicus
Invested in myself just like vending machines with shades I'm stackin' chips
Go holla at KP 'fore I show ya broski my management
Big paper in pocket 'bout to fall out
So many fans can't even shop inside the mall now
Oh bitches see me on, oh they wanna call now
Shout out my haters who keep Tony dick in your mouth
You diss on me, me and my hitters up in your house
Caught a body, took the pistols to my dog house
Shawty riding for me I lay back she ride it for me
And understand that I'm the man and hella bitches tryna fuck me
Even though I am a killer she still love me bride of Chucky
And if she's poetic justice well I guess that I am lucky
She's my numero uno I don't know what you bitches think
She like me and just like me she don't smoke and she don't drink
She stay focused and her flow sound like a boat so we don't sink
Three hundred dollars worth of groceries got it all off of her link
Head fire, pussy good and you know that pussy pink
When I slide up in that pussy keep me warm just like a mink
Set that bitch up on the counter fucked her on the kitchen sink
And when I'm done she always bring me a wet towel and something to drink
And I'm like (ahh)
And she go hard for her nigga
See shawty held me down when times was hard for a nigga
Rent me cars, crack me cards bring it all to a nigga
If it's a foul yo she gon' take the charge for her nigga
And if I pass the pistol she gon' spark for her nigga
Up that iron and start sprayin' like stars for her nigga
Bring me back another broad then menage with her nigga
One sucking my dick one sucking the balls on a nigga
They eat me like a shark and turn to Jaws on a nigga
Let me cum all on their faces Santa Claus for a nigga
And when I'm on the road she help withdrawals for a nigga
Snapchat she make it clap I mean applause for a nigga yeah
Bitch I got bars like a prison
These other rappers weak you better toss 'em the spinach
And I promise they can't see me they Ray Charles to a nigga
And I'm all about my commas like a pause in a sentence
So make sure it's 'bout money when you calling a nigga
I'm a dog on a mission, flow's so raw and efficient
I go hard I'm consistent ain't no fraudulent business
Even haters talkin' shit was all a part of my vision
I told bro get on your shit so we can all make a killing
Risk it all 'fore I let my family starve in the trenches
No brakes I'm so driven I could cause a collision
If I kill you on sight, then I'm offing the witness
I'll be off in 60 seconds you get lost in a minute
So go ahead and dig a hole I'll put your coffin up in it
Niggas used to be my dogs now they all in they feelings
But it's FGE for life I'm taking off with the realest SQUAD!
Ratchets on deck passing pistols to my mans
Three killers with me with ski masks in the van
We gon' pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Rolling down your block
'bout to pop like rubber bands
Have them bodies drop
Them kids never had a chance
When I pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck

Everywhere I go niggas know I keep the pole
Heater on me like I'm cold

Broski roll with me before
Therefore he know how it go

Niggas hate me and my mans because we be getting bands
40 in my pants, tell the opps it's time to dance
Boy don't make me come and find y'all

Head shots when I'm firin' off
Your brains on the sidewalk
And right after I pop 'em I swear I forget about 'em
Niggas claim the with the shits until I shoot the shit up out 'em yeah

Ratchets on deck passing pistols to my mans
Three killers with me with ski masks in the van

Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Rolling down your block

I bet bodies drop
Them kids never had a chance
When I pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck

Bitch I think I'm Nino mixed with Al Pacino
Stacking chips like Pringles
I ball like Ochocinco
Ice man Dean Malenko
My wrist look like sprinkles
Iron in my pants like I'm getting out the wrinkles
Take a nigga out and I ain't talking 'bout a date
Cook a nigga like a steak and fix his niggas like a plate
Like a pepsi you get popped
Send your ass to heaven's gates
Got the police on your block
Decorate with yellow tape
(Go to church)
Okay fuckboy you softer than Nerf
I'm lurking all through your turf
When I pop at you I turn families blue
I'mma pop a nigga no smurf
These niggas clowns and Imma kill a clown so jokers don't post up
Been no joke, I don't smoke but Imma burn hard when I roll up
My mask on, my gloves on so I don't give a fuck who see me
That semi pop and start sending shots
I'll put you in a box like Houdini
Get smoked like loud packs when I pull up where your house at
Y'all bitch niggas, Y'all fugazi
My crew crazy we bounce back

Ratchets on deck passing pistols to my mans
Three killers with me with ski masks in the van
We gon' pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Rolling down your block
Bout to pop like rubber bands
I bet bodies drop
Them kids never had a chance
When I pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Look, big wings
On a nigga like the emblem with the big B's
Me and Tony two players like a split screen
I put my shooters on yo ass like some skinny jeans
And they goin' show up, poled up, shootin' anything
Cause they know a nigga breaded like some chicken wings
So for me they get it poppin' like it's in the grease
I have my youngins take your life and give it to me
I swear them niggas ain't right like 50 degrees
Zoro when I cut it leave her with the big Z's
And she gonna chew a nigga up cause i'm big league
You niggas small ball
All my niggas ball hogs
Shooters whack you with that iron like a golf ball
Put a hole in a nigga with the sawed off
Say he want beef but you niggas all talk
But we can still shoot about it like a false call
Body on the stretcher why he gettin' hauled off
And have his niggas all lost yelling aww nah
All y'all dogs should have been toting though
But I still feel like I gotta show them tho
I put the wings on a nigga like he OVO
Even though i'm at the top of the totem pole
I still take the shit wherever you wanna go
And then i take your bitch wherever she wanna go
Fly guys taking off, nigga

Niggas fake as fuck
That's why i choose to hug a pole
Had to bear up
Fill a hater up with shells like he layin' numb
Pockets healthy just like Gucci tryna keep it up
I can hit your bitch just gotta spend the day with her
Give her dick she sport it good, like i'm payin' her
Fresh as hell, be on point like Deadshot
Shawty let me slide in like the Red Box
Got a man ha, I want neck, headlock
Takin' bitches think I'm Future look who Scottie Pippen
Like he seen a magic trick he wonder how I did it
You know I had to bag his bitch but ain't no body in it
No details how I did it
My bitch crazy and I'm crazy I'm Joker she Harley Quinn
I be all up in her water like tryna learn how to swim
Haters tryna block the shine like a nigga rockin' a brim
If the snakes up in the grass Imma stomp the yard in some Timbs
These old bitches hit my line had to cut 'em off like a limb
Got new bitches on my line had to cut 'em all like a pimp
And I got my money up like I'm taping it to the ceiling
I be fresh, swag kill 'em I murder 'em no attempt
Had to show everybody I'm flyer but no event
I pop up just like an ad and I'm loaded like movin' shit
If he try I do 'em dirty just like the water in Flint then
I be shootin after him just like knockout but I don't miss

Fly guy, flew in this bitch with a high side
Why lie? I see it like I-Spy
They want us dead, My god but I ride
I'm a cool cat but nigga I ain't got nine lives
Bitch it's YOLO, fuck the po-po
Don't go nowhere without the 4-0, that's a no-no
Up on 'em like i pop a no-doze
Let him hold those
Bitch I'm a dog on a gold road like I'm Toto
But I don't follow up a chase behind no bitch
It ain't no frito niggas lays behind those chips
I got brothers in the grave that I so miss
Got dogs fighting in a cage, no Michael Vick
Harry Potter with that stick on a snitch
You know how we playin' if they sending shots in them 6
Then we keep spraying
Preacher talking 'bout turn a cheek, fuck what he sayin'
Kill him and it's justified sin, but we keep prayin'
In a world where majority sleep, horribly weak
And they slaughter when they order the sheet
God sharpening my sword and bitch i'm going for the cheek
Make sure I give 'em everything before I'm goin to sleep
Feel this who want a war with the son
I do this shit for my loved ones who don't know what's to come
Hardships, tribulations and they gon' know not to run
God first, load up some guns and store up some funds
When you shinin' watch the snake that's tryna soak up your sun
Yeah they hate it when you make it and you don't owe 'em none
I pray handle what I can and made her wrestle the slums
Why so serious 'cause bitch when you the joke it ain't fun, huh

No Surrender No Retreat Bitch
FGE we gotta eat bitch
Bout to kill another beat bitch

That's money gram to the fam, you ain't hear me tho
Yeah I was made to get the paper like a envelope
See I turned nothing in to something I was really broke
Had to come up the harder way ain't have a penny tho
I used to meet my clientele up in the liquor store
I sold more O's than a fucking box of Cheerios
Left all the bullshit behind Tom Thibodeau
Rap God in this bitch, like a embryo
And I like all my bitches bad like a billy goat
I put your hoe up on the wall like a centerfold
Deep stroke in that bitch, I ain't swimming though

Special beam on my cannon like I'm piccolo
Pull it out the pants cook a nigga like he in a stove
Shoot a nigga like he tryna drop a video
Six feet put him in like he pigeon-toed
Punchlines hurt opponents like I'm Riddick Bowe

The illest quotes every line like I'm sniffin' coke
Rap God in this bitch nigga!

Pussy is okay but I'm in love with the throat though
Break bread with broski but be quick to tell a ho no
No Young Thug, that's no homo
Bitch where was you when I was broke though?
No we can't kick it stupid bitch, this ain't no Dojo
Like hockey rinks you know the flow cold

Get fucking paid like a  ho stroll
Stay in the field with them poles like a goal post
Was selling bud for the low low
Reggie, mid, I even sold dro
Still independent, got more wisdom than the old folks
Stop selling drugs now I get 10k for a show though
Bitch I'm Lebron, I'm way ahead of my time
Fuck who ain't rocking with me
Compared to you niggas, Tony is way ahead of you niggas
You don't need binoculars to see
Bad yellow bitch and she driving for me
40 cal under the passenger seat
Like D Wade, since day one been riding with the heat
Had to do what I did to survive in these streets
You already know if you don't grind you don't eat
Can't take no more L's, don't got no time for defeat
Ain’t get help from nobody, so I went and got it
I'm honest nothing was promised to me
Ain't no stoppin' my shine, to the top I'mma climb
Hope I make on time for my mama to see
My brain is bionic, atomic, I guess I can come and teach you about astrology
Fan say they love when I'm riding the beat
I'm good with the flow, I can mop, I can sweep
See niggas be hating then hop in a whip with a bitch and she got the Rap god on repeat
Cursed With A Blessing on Itune right now, If you buy it you feel like you copping a ki
Back in 08' I was copping them P's
Now I get paid just to hop on the beat
Someone tell DJ Drama to holla at me, I Jeffrey Dahmer a beat
Go talk to the Devil and ask him who is he
He'll tell you that he wish he was hotter than me
I'm armed in this bitch, Iverson rocking the sleeve
Goofys get popped when I squeeze
Although I'm cool as a tropical breeze, I will let this bitch blow like a thot on her knees
I feel for you niggas like I can not see
I shoot like Ray Allen when popping the three
Stop and pop up from the top of the key
Don't want problems with me, bitch I got what you need
I don't twitter beef, boy them choppers will speak
Come to your crib and then rock you to sleep
Body your ass then hop in the jeep, boy that 187 ain't mean nothing to me
Slide on them at night, they pajamas to me
Get popped in your noggin, your partners retreat
Every move I make them piranhas with me
I promise you don't want to collide with a beast
So fuck what you thought
We gonna outline these squares up in chalk like they playing hopscotch in the streets
When I come with them goons ain't no goblins with me
There ain't no way in hell you're surviving the heat
Broski know how it goes
We done been here before we gonna kick in the door and then pop them on three
I been popping niggas, my big poppa spitting
Bitch I got that Christopher Wallace with me

Get in my face watch me shoot it like a bad shot

Do them like I did the last nigga
Shoot them through the glass nigga

Body after body all I know is murder, I'm from the darkside
If I have to draw, serve like volleyball, and drop it on y'all side
That's why I try hard to not get involved, and stay under God's lie
When I promise tomorrow just saw at their face, and pray for the lost eyes
Nigga's playing games with this shit
Why I'm hopin brains will get hit
I target minds, I ain't talkin' shells
But I really aim in this spit
What's your direction, nigga?
Do you know where you heading, nigga?
Hope it's to the cheddar, nigga
Then the heaven nigga, or whatever
But can't be around me if you don't want better, nigga
Yeah I know I'm ahead of nigga's
And I don't embellish, nigga
I try not to embarrass nigga's
But sometimes I can't help it, it's not in my character
It's just God's will that he carry with him
And you know that my berry with them
Case the hate get too real, it's okay, get buried with them
I will not Tom and Jerry with them
Cherry pick em, and drop every top that get hairy with him
I should thank God I ain't kickin' in doors no more
Emptying poles no more
50's on the road doe hoe
It ain't nothing to blow your show
But I'm in it to go get the cash
Give and get the love tryin' to reach the fans
Motivate they plans

Hopin' they advance

Bandannas like Montana's over my face when I hit em up

Tell bud he better be wiser before he get hit in his six pack
Right out the can, yeah, sip that

Ballin', but not in the league
'Tigue

Rap God, FGE shit
You already know how we comin', man
Bases loaded in this bitch
Uhuuuhh

Fire in the church
There's liars in the church
Scratch the surface, find a diamond in the dirt
You gotta grind until it hurts
I am triumphed and diversed
Flow rare, unfair, might start a riot with this verse
I will father like Mufasa 'til I'm lyin' in the hearse
Drive your lioners berzerk
I see clients in my merch
Ok, I'm breaded bitch
You know I'm breaded like mozzarella sticks
Godly, how is he heaven sent but so devilish?
The coldest flow, colder than any Eskimos ever been
Was sellin' shit
I served for 8 years, I felt like the president
Been nailin' shit
You'll get off tonight like you workin' second shift
Wings up, all praise to the merciful and beneficent
I second guess the message
The truth ain't never pleasant
The future's present hip-hop's alive and resurrected
Play with me and I'm airin' opps
It get's uglier than Carrot Top
Leave her pussy bloody like it's cherry popped
Six feet deep, three pair of socks
Put em in the ground, that's deep rooted
We keep winnin', y'all keep losin'
We don't twitter beef, bitch we shootin'
All kinda clips, come preview it
This clip in my ak got 50 in it, that's G-Unit
Got another clip with a hundred rounds
That got mo' in it, that's 3 Stooges
Plus 30 in my Dez Eagle
Turn em into red people
Whack em while their jewelry on
Nigga, icy dead people
Glock sing when the mops ring
Lay em down first like a box spring

Squah!
Rap god, man, FGE shit, man. You already know what it is man
You already know why I'm here, man
I ain't like this fucking beat. Only doing this shit cause my fans asked me
In the studio, eating Halls and shit. Still sick with this shit

These haters on my dick piss em off
Take a pic with his bitch flick him off
These rappers trying to steal my swag get the sauce
They sold they soul for a loan niggas lost
I was lit like a new torch,streets was my new sport
Belt buckle double g's like two forks
Was drug dealing freakin balling like I'm Too $hort
Was serving niggas in the mall like a food court
Deuce 5 on me I was Derrick Rose in New York
Had to put some squares in a box like some Newport's
I grew older and my heart got colder
And my mind got stronger
And my money got longer
And them bitches got naked,and them people started hatin'
And my guns got bigger,so my flow got sicker
Let me tell you about this young cat,I always used to front packs
Was known for poking niggas for that paper like a thumbtack
I told them come rap, stop hangin with them dumb cats
It's free J Real until the day my nigga comeback
I used to pull up on the block with the bass banging
Big Strap hug a nigga like he waist training
I catch you clowns running around get your face painted
I put the chrome to his dome cause I hate aiming
10K for a show, you better hurry before the price change up
Rap god the light bringer,The life changer
I hope they pull it, 30 bullets in my banger
Versace shoes on looking like the white ranger
And these bitches not my problem they ain't stressing me
Bitch if you not my you bitch you can't question me
And shawty wanna blow my whistle she be beggin me
You call her Stephanie?, I call her referee
Shawty got that fire head that's a specialty
Head down between my legs OOOUUU pedigree

Like why you keep on sonning them I should get a vasectomy
Flow heavenly G.O.D. keep on blessing me
On my legacy
Saucing they want the recipe
I'm flyer then a Frisbee got all the bitches fetching me
And your bitch like my song she know every word like a spelling bee
Boy I swear we will be nothing breathing ahead of me
Came a long way from selling weed, wetting shit like the 7 seas
Stacking dough,and cracking hoes filling niggas with jealousy
Way before the felony's had these bitch niggas scared of me
I promise if you threaten me, When I see you you better be ready to back it up because I'm on your heels like i'm Beverly
Killing the infidelity,After U like the letter V
Gun smoking so much I think God might just be inhaling me
My swagger said,Might bag ya bitch
Go through walls like casper shit
Might sent her back after I hit,Then go home to the baddest bitch
Thats savage shit,I spaz and shit
Rap god to some I'm blasphemous
I've mastered this,They mad as shit
They can't stand me like Kapernick
I've passed the grace,Steve Nash assist
My wrist matches Michael Jackson's kicks
That 40 in my lap and shit,No poking me like cactus's
And no more moving packages
I'm stacking chips,my cash is thick
They broke as hell but paying tithes
Reason there pastor is rich
Pole inside my jumpsuit look like I be running track and shit
This 30 be my magic stick
I shoot like I'm T Mack with it
Catch an opp in traffic like Lebron you know I'm glassin' shit Don't joke and play,Just hope and pray one day I don't go back to this
Trunk fly in the front on some Dumbo shit
Bitch I'm flying until I die on my Nutso shit
Now run and tell all your friends how I went nuts on this
I'm cutthroat bitch,I promise I don't trust no bitch
And I ain't even gotta meet her I can fuck your bitch
Balling like Krillin bet I cut like a destructo disc
You play with mines I'm on your ass fuck all that humble shit
The greatest pussy never seen a killer come so quick
Clip out the window hanging longer then Rapunzel shit
It go BRAAAAAAATTT until my gun go click
Pussy's always in there feelings about something I said
Yelling "Gang, Gang, Gang" until one of them dead
You gotta brain better use it or get one in the head
I got killers like porn stars there gonna come for the bread
But I'm so independent with it I'm coming with it instead
I'll pop you up until you drop like you was jumping in bed
Go wash my hands after I leave the scene covered in red
Then kiss my momma on the head and tuck my sons into bed
Caught em lackin' up in traffic and got clean on em
Ease on em, let my trigger finger squeeze on em
Put that pressure on the nigga like it's weed on em
Smoked his ass,Hit the gas(VROOM), Speed on em

Demons dressed as friends better watch them they envious
Don't Doubt The God album dropping May 20th
These haters on my dick piss, em off
They never..Whatchu' thought
FGE got it on lock, man of course
Hater's on my dick,piss em off
I remember coming home back from the store
To my Momma smoking crack on the stove
Back then we was lackin’ the dough
Never would’ve thought one day I’d be baggin’ up O’s
Pack in a pole, standing on the Ave with the folks
Feeling like Shaq in the post
Now a nigga rappin’ at shows, gettin’ cash for the flow like turn up swag on ‘em hoes
(Then I gotta thank god)
Thank god we ain’t broke no mo’, ain’t gotta kick doors no mo’
Ain’t gotta sell dope no mo’, ain’t it funny all of sudden all the hoes gon go
Momma told me boy spit that pain, bet the whole world gon’ chant yo name
Nigga I’m blessed I can’t complain, I’m one of one I can’t come plain
No days off man niggas ain’t train like this, street nigga with aim like this
Feeling like Mike in a game like this, got me thinking I could really make change like this
If I slang like this and I hang like this wit my chain like this bunch of rings like this
Pull up on a nigga in a range like swish, switchin’ hands on ‘em when I drive the lane like this
But it ain’t like that, that’s the reason why I came like that
Everywhere I go I bring my strap, cause these opps tryna block
When they see you headed to the top and I let the 40 bang like that
Watch his brain go splat, keep it movin’ if you ain’t on that
Once I do it boy I can’t go back, I been at niggas heads like a kangol hat
Got more fire than a lighter boy you ain’t no match
You don’t know my struggle, you don’t my grind, you don’t know the thoughts going thru a nigga mind
You don’t know my past, you don’t my path, you don’t my wrath, nah pussy nigga you don’t know the half
You don’t know my cash, you don’t know my math, you don’t know the racks that a nigga done had
You don’t know about the ungrateful muthafuckas talking down when a nigga got down to his last
Real nigga bounce back, you don’t know my stash
You don’t know the snakes, you don’t even mow the grass
You don’t know the good, you don’t know the bad
You don’t know the goodtime, you don’t know the sad
You don’t know the real, you don’t know the will, you don’t know ill, my nigga you don’t know the feel
You don’t know the deal, you don’t know the drill when we in the field all my niggas know when to kill
You gotta go hard man I promise it ain’t no love in these streets boy
Once had hoop dreams but then got turned in to a D-boy
Risking my freedom so the ones I love can eat boy
This world is cold it’s only right I keep that heat on
Nigga I don’t trust shit, fuck yo assumptions, I ain’t got time for the fuck shit
Boy I from the city where they grind, liftin’ nine, niggas dyin’ in the mind, and the blind is corrupted
We bringing that toast, since a yougin’ I was told shit happen
Gotta be on point like a cactus, momma kept the blade in the mattress
Daddy kept a gun in the dresser, wish a nigga would come test us
My nigga I done live the frontline, and I takeover when it’s clutch time
Why you waitin’ on a punchline, I hope you ready when it’s duck time
Cuz I’m liftin’ two 45’s like I pump iron
Runway down the one way admiration for the gun play
I hope I don’t catch another gun case
And it seem like the people that you do the most for be the ones fake
And Shawty told you that she love you, always be there for you, claim she’ll do anything for you
Soon as a nigga go to jail and get time you gon find she was lying man these bitches ain’t loyal
We all fall for the devil’s tricks, nailing chicks that be hella thick
I’m selling shit to get hella chips, addiction got us hella sick
Only God is the medicine all the other shit is irrelevant
We got eat in this world full of greed everybody want a big bite
I swear to God in this life ain’t shit right
I got niggas up in jail talented as hell but can’t get right
I from the bottom came from nada but I promise you gon see us take flight like a big kite
I’m still a nigga that yo bitch like, shit tight, wrist bright, try me both hands on the 12 like midnight
And you don’t want to feel a gauge nigga
You don’t want to hear pump sound
You don’t want to feel the rage nigga
Didn’t I tell you I don’t fuck around, I put an end to your age nigga
You don’t want to meet your gravedigger, I don’t give fuck about a cage nigga
I know the pain like a slave nigga to me it’s just another day nigga
I never fail to amaze but I’m stuck up in my ways nigga
Swaggin' like Allen

I swear to God I used to blast shit
Let families sad shit

That boy was askin'
He wanted to see if I was savage or just be rappin'
I put his ass under the seat call him Sebastian
Don't make me put on that mask bitch

Don't know who you think I am
When I show up its catfish

Outside his mansion
Come out and balling like a fan bitch
Right after I blam shit
Back to them bands bitch
I'm saucin' bitch I got recipe now
Every move I make, I make a check for me now
Make dough off my clothes no more sellin the loud
Off on tour doing shows I ain't never around
My old bitches wish I was nailing them now
Instagram model be checking me out
All them opps showing love and respect for me now
Pussy ass niggas could never be down
You better be God if you testing me now
Give death to these actors, Heath Ledger a clown
Spraying them up and wetting em' down
Fire in the case for a felony now
Praying to God with my head up to the clouds
Askin them to never stop blessing me now
But I'm still gonna blow like a Referee now
I go hard for my sons I ain't letting them down

Like Iverson

Hit you with no delaying
So what you saying ho
All my lyrics is groundbreaking that Super Saiyan flow
Yeah my .40 cal bang more
That pops off of Wayans bros
Wet up shit like the rain though
This what we trained for
I am off of the chain hoe
Call me the Django
Rap god or the dang GOAT both in the same boat
On these tracks I'm Usian Bolt
Nothing has came close
This is what I get payed for
Dropping grenades hoe
Just bought broski a Draco
I give him the say-so
Black mask like he Space Ghost
Try me like Dej Loaf
I ain't gotta call my hittas up I'll come and get rid of you
Smiling looking sinister
Pull up in somethin' tinted up
Body you and then I lay low like Forest Whitaker
Then go up lift my brothers and sisters like I'm the minister
I ain't perfect with my kids if I ain't working
I encourage higher learning I'm teaching through fire verses
Till the day we lie in hearses
I'm fighting the lying serpent
Ride and lurking
Hit you pussies make sure you don't die a virgin
Johnny Torture
Tire burning
I'm fancy like writing cursive
Rap God I'm way to real to have someone come write my verses
Dangerous
You know this ain't a game to us
My bang will bust
These bullets hit your brains and guts
Get changed to dust
Ain't no one else to blame but us
You strange to us
Fu niggas cannot hang with us
You lame to us
These other rappers plain to us
My labels tough
Like KD back with James and Russ
Word to my mother I'm
Eating like supper time
I come from trouble times
I knew the sun would shine
Im hot like summertime
Dreaded like Busta Rhymes
My girl so fucking fine
Mo' cake than Duncan Hines
They said Hip-Hop was dead
But i came just in time
My bars hold hella weight
Bitch I'm just pumping iron
This is serious
These fuck niggas on my dick and they fear me cause
I made them bleed like a bitch on her period
Banana clips for you monkeys if you curious
This is that part of chess
I got you all in check
They thought I wouldn't make it
I made them all regret
I ball so fucking hard
The ref might call a tech
Might hit the mall and flex
My sons and my daughter fresh
I'll never sell my soul
Bitch i won't fall for that
You can't get me to change
You got to call collect
Nike just like me my nigga I am a walking check
I'm more than blessed and more calculated than architects
I'm who they call the best
Flew from a falling nest
If I feel y'all a threat
We outside of y'all address
You don' f'd up all black we dressed up
Put a clip up to his head give that boy a fresh cut
Driving dirty with no Ls i was living reckless
Swerving serving pounds just to get my check up
Had 20 on my wrist 20 on my necklace
Balled every time you see me just like Uncle Fester
I ran into the law man that shit was messed up
Never fold under pressure mother fuck them questions
Your niggas harmless; mine dangerous like Coolio
Don't get nailed with this hammer I stay with the tooly, yo
I be strapped at every show even strapped at the studio
Just know that when you see these clips you ain't watching no movie though
No I don't give a fuck who he run with or who he know
I bet I leave them in the past give it to them like Rubio
Aw shit he catching bullets like Julio
I got green in my pants you just hating like Rufio
For acting funny like Chris Rock I'll smoke them like pookie, hoe
I got Powers like like I’m Austin, and I'm saucing, I'm groovy, hoe
And I've been rocking Bandannas since Weezy and Juve hoe
Yeah my belt and shoes Louis my glasses is Gucci though
When you hustling watch for rats man the shit can get spooky though
You got to get it then get out I learned that from the movie Blow
SQUAD!
FGE we some hot niggas
Never catch me in no picture with no op niggas
And J-Real that's my shooter he done popped niggas
No we don't box but I'll put you in the box nigga
Came from the bottom now I'm clean, detox nigga
Whole squad get into the guap nonstop nigga
Pocket full of knots niggas
Know he keeps them Glocks with us
Itchy on me while I'm getting scratch, chicken pox nigga
I remember takin' money to the stash house
Now'a'days i be pullin' all this cash out
Foreign broads, foreign cars when I smash out
Who woulda thought it all started from a half ounce
And nigga all i know is spaz out
Turn down my block and see these hittas, better bag out
I call my hammer camera show you what this flash 'bout
Ready for you pussies so you know I keep that mag out
Bitch I'm a savage I do damage I'm a bad boy
I end your life quick, play it watch me fast forward
Don't let me catch you up traffic with that bad broad
While gettin' top *POP* brains on the dashboard
I'm the most electrifyin' and death-defyin' yea petrifyin'
Giant mesmerizin' you niggas with what I specialize in
Weaponizin' my brain with knowledge I know you recognizin'
Excersizin' demons they fiendin' and im forever grindin'
If I'm coppin' nine im cockin' nine and poppin' nine
It ain't rocket science your daughter find you a box to lie in
Now the preacher preachin' the choir singin' your momma cryin'
Thots be lyin' on me they want me to slide my cock inside 'em
Rap god baby im tryin', I am hip hop's goliath
Cursin' all you rappers with blessings while im monopolizin'
Sorry motherfuckas apologizin' is not surprisin'
I'm that awkward silence, so powerful I can stop a riot
And Tally been my nigga since the sixth grade
Always poppin' out the cut like a switchblade
And nigga fuck all this rap shit
You dont wanna see me in that all black shit
You keep on talkin' Ima kill you put that on to God
After I find out where you livin' Ima go inside
Its goin' down, slide over with the .45
Click Clack wet his ass like a water slide
Or I might run up like a bum on em (BANG)
Police interrogate I'm goin' dumb on em
My nigga you don't want the gun play
My gun spray I off a nigga like the bug spray
Beats get brutally murdered whenever I be on it
Flow so cold Wayne Gretzky could come play hockey on it
Sold the nina thing for 250 and had a body on it
And theres plenty more where that come from if anybody want it
I tell my nigga throw the SUV in reverse
I'm bout to put these pussy niggas on a t-shirt
So pray to god when I up it you don't be first
Before he judge yo ass you gotta see me first
That nigga shoulda had a vest on him
These niggas squares baby I'm just playin' chess on em
Bitches on D like a full court press on em
Headrest ready shawty wanna put the neck on him
Growin' up i never had shit
Well motherfucka' that was past tense
Now i got it that's why i be talkin' cash shit
She only cheat on him with me now that's a bad bitch
Like if God had wrote the bible
This is straight from the mouth of the person who made these verses
Can't change the words on this album
I'm loading my gun while reading 48 Laws of Power
The rapper that taught you how to acknowledge the higher power
Not eating bullshit they feed us, I duck it like Robert Townsend
I'm the son that he's proud of, that's linking you like a browser
They beat you therefore you cower
Slave owners is who you bow to
I'm on a whole 'nother level, Vegeta gon' need a scouter
I am the hottest outchea
Don't need no label to vouch, yeah
I'm wilder than Rottweiler
That's high off the gun powder
Came from the dirt like a flower, fuck nigga don't ever doubt us
My regulators 'gon mount up and wet you up like a shower
Fly high as the Lord allow us
While keeping fuck shit from 'round us
The flyest killas you know like them pilots the twin towers
I'm getting gwola, I'm getting hotter, my future's blazing
The lava flowin, I got it going, I'm too impatient
I'm cold as hell like I'm cool with Satan, I'm too amazing
I've been in my glo like a super saiyan, you used to hating
Forever hustling, might catch me in heaven selling spirits
If you saw my bitch, you swear there's an angel in heaven missing
Bars so hot you would think I sat in the devil's prison
They say Jesus coming, I'm starting to think he'll never visit
If you are listening, you are witnessing exorcism
The best description is: heaven sent him, he's blessed for rhythm
Father to my sons I can never be no deadbeat
And still saluting pops because I never forget who fed me
Pain is what prepared me, struggle ain't never scared me
Beef with anybody, I love my nigga; you dead meat
And I don't mean to brag, but pardon me like the red sea
And I ain't grocery shopping but I'll be where the bread be
I got this rap shit on lock, that's why they dread me
Ask Satan who he fear most of all and that nigga said me
Bitch I'm so mothafucking cold I can summon souls
And I can make the summer cold flow go dumb as Cole
I get more money on the road, then the fucking toll
Like strippers catch me with that dough and the fucking pole
Sliding on them like debit, I'm trained to shoot like I'm Riddick
I lay you down like some edges, and show you pussies what wet is
I studied you, did my research, learned how you work like a medic
Come out the cut with that chopper, I take shit out when I edit
I'll shoot your ass like a movie, and then I roll like the credits
I put in work on my own, bitch my middle name calisthenics
I remember when I was starving, remember when I was broke
Remember hating that feeling, didn't wanna feel it no more
I remember bagging up dope and selling it like a Bo
When worried 'bout getting poked, had nina under my coat
Remember when y'all was sleeping, remember when I was woke
I was up perfecting my flow, now I'm getting bread by the loaf
The same ones that used to divide us, edit bibles to blind us
Beat us killed and deprived us, and we gon' let 'em guide us?
The best disguise is a book, you know they demise us
You wanna rise up nigga, you better wise up
You think for God like he's hiding but he's inside us
Wakes us up everyday but you still ain't opened your eyes up
I can provide the truth for you, even provide the proof for you
Stupid folks ain't gon' get it, you stick would who tied the noose for us
The same ones who tied the knot and put that rope up
Been telling lies to get the common people's hopes up
And everything that they printed, you chose to soak up
The jokes up, they ain't fear us until we woke up
My 40 on me plus God with me, I ain't alone
Yes I'm that nigga they hated on, heart made of stone
They came a long way taking losses but staying strong
Said I wouldn't make it but they was wrong, my paper long
Picasso, any canvas I ever painted on
They play my songs and debate upon my greatest poems
Now that the kids can sing along, I'm breaking bones
They faith is gone, they wish they was on like Game Of Thrones
Can't chill with fake men, I'd rather spend all of my days alone
I seen more snakes than Medusa
Therefore my face is stoned
And you know God is not the author of confusion
Do you really rock with God or were you bribed with an illusion?
Hoping at them pearly gates, he'll pick you up when he's choosing
And your chances isn't ruined by the sinning you've been doing
As soon as that karma set in
Forgive me father I'm begging
I'm thankful for all my blessings and instantly start confessing
You need to be taught a lesson
See I was charged with possession
I mentally store artillery, every thought is a weapon
I'm prepping for Armageddon, curing the narcoleptic
I'm just giving my gift, so I wrap my past with my present
I'm spitting bars with a message, not here to spar with you Reverend
I ain't going against God, cause I came across him with questions
Yeah, I can make you pause for a second, hell
I don't wanna go if my loved ones ain't all in heaven
God
FGE shit
Fire in the Church
And all that
May 20th
This why they call me the fuckin' rap god, man

Tony Mon-tana
And bro nem got blown with the blamma
I freed all the guys out the slamma
I came with that bag like I'm Santa
Two straps on my hip like a Pamper
Try to check us, get popped like a Fanta
I will slide with that pole like a dancer
Come up outta that tent like a camper
Dressed up in all black like a panther
I creep and I crawl, no tarantula
Bandana my face in a flag
Choppa singin' the national anthem
I'm shootin' shit, Canon
The clip's in a shape like banana
He got nailed he wasn't watching his grammar
Bitch I think I'm Thor with the hammer
A.I. what I nicknamed my gun
And yo' question, I stay with the answer
In the field, I will leave yo' ass lyin'
In a hole, you get buried like Sanders
Oh, I could black both of your eyes
Leave your bitch ass lookin' like a panda
I get green like the hulk, no Atlanta
Right after they check out my lines like a scanner
Got your bitch on my dick, I can't stand her
Hit, now she think she all that like Amanda
Yeah, you know I ball like Evander
And she call me daddy like I'm Danny Tanner
The pussy pink like she fight cancer
I let that bitch give me top on the camera
Went down south from me like Alabama
I came and I made that bitch step like the gamma

It's too fuckin' easy!
Get off me!
I'm just getting warmed up in this mothafucka'
Wooh!
Wooh!
Wooh!
Wooh!

Turned off her phone to make you think that her phone dead
She grabbed my Gucci belt buckle, I told her "Go ahead"
She ate my dick and nicknamed it Dick Daddy Long Legs
She gave me dome so long, I called her ConeHead
You a send-off
You be taking orders, Good Burger nigga
Old broke ass, pockets hurtin', nigga
Is you fat or skinny Buddy Sherman nigga
I discourage niggas, then dirt a nigga
Klay Thompson got the Stephen Curry with 'em
That's a warrior we got with a 30 with 'em
Boy this ain't a game, I ain't Derwin, nigga
Get in rappers' head like a turban, nigga
Make 'em feel the heat like a furnace, nigga
If I wave it at 'em like a current, nigga
Then he catchin' bullets, Michael Irvin, nigga
With his magazine from this ratchet sing
Ain't no calories, I'll burn a nigga
Put yo' greasy ass in a fuckin' box
That's churches, nigga, I done murdered niggas
If I'm lyin', then God can come strike me down
When I come up they gon' invite me out
Stay online talkin' shit 'till i sign 'em out
Had to check 'em, I took 'em to Nike town
And these bitches, they wanna be wifey now
I just did nine shows, that's ninety thou(sand)
I be drippin', I know they don't like me now
Somebody please come and wipe me down
I'm on the edge, no baseline
With a hoodie on like Trayvon
I'll shorten up your lifespan, I don't waste time to come take time
Black 40 singin', thats Akon
I'm a real shoota, fuck James Bond
No screenshot, my gun flash, all headshots, that's FaceTime
Back to the green, like Draymond
Whoo!
But see me, I don't play no fuckin' games
You a goofy, a Buford, a fuckin' lame
You wanna ride on my dick for some fuckin' fame
Get sent out from your block, that's a fuckin' shame
Even you know you not in my fuckin' lane
I pulled up on you niggas like Birdman
And you know not to play with my fuckin' name
I know God gon' be real disappointed in me
If I choose to come blow out ya fuckin' brains
Do yo' pussy ass like I did What's-His-Name
Take his ass out the fuckin' game
You a toy boy you ain't got Buzz
You ain't hard, nigga you a fake Woody
Cook his soft ass like some baked cookies
Zip his body up like a Bape hoodie
My lyrics dope, I got crack for the fiends
He thought he could see me, he imagining things
He ain't enough cash to come clash with the king
While you boys was sleepin', I mastered yo' dreams
I'm swaggin', I'm saucin', with fashion I'm clean
I come through with some shit that you haven't seen
You gotta be sick, all you do is ride dicks
Someone go get this pussy some vaginal cream
They call me Girbauds, got that strap in my jeans
I'm Abdul Jabbar, cause I'm after Kareem
If he crosses the line, then my bullets flyin'
I'll give him a 50 like he Zach Lavine
Boy, you just a actor that rap like Hakeem
Don't make me come down like the wrestler Sting
Take L's like a knight when I slide like a bishop
I'll checkmate your king then snatch up your queen
I'm bout to blow like they passed me the green
Just got a new gat, it's a mac with a beam
My gauge is Fantasia, whenever I sing
Get wet with this pump when I squeeze gasoline
See, when it come down to them bars
Bitch I got a whole buncha' lotta' shit
You can pay for this knowledge with scholarships
Rap god givin' hip hop it's oxygen
They find it astonishing

Shine like he polished himself

He's been blessed, he's the best
He's like Jordan in '96
FGE who we rockin' with
Record labels mad cause he ain't signin' shit
I thank God that I don't owe nobody shit
Flow with an old soul like a moccasin
Go tell 'Ye that I'm killin Desiigner's shit
I just bear hugged a panda then bodied it
You irrelevant, you talk a lotta shit
You should write a book called "How to Ride a Dick"
Man he fresh, I be on some Big Tymer shit
Bitches hope I slide in with my hockey stick
My 40 got 30 inside of it
It got Mr. Miyagi's karate kick
I'll blast off, shoot you up like a rocket ship
Bullets bust in yo' face like you poppin' zits
With them guns he be clumsy, he droppin' shit
Zip you up like a onesie, I'm poppin' shit

Had to put the panda in a pine box

I stay with that glocky
Be flashy and cocky
Flow colder then hockey
More checks then Horrace
Yea this nigga paid
This nigga made
And all of my shooters gone blow like grenades
We stay with them guns
And shine line the sun
If you can't stand the heat you gone die in the shade
From the the PC so shout out to my jets
2820 south cal you met
Straight off the low end
And when I start flowing you know Ima go in like nothing but net
Was up in the trap like i was caught in a net
Waiting on the 1st of the month for them checks
My mom was a victim
Cocaine in her system sometimes It felt like my OG was possessed
Young nigga stressed
Bad up in school acting a fool report card full of F's
As I grew older I got a little wiser
Opened my eyes and realized that I'm blessed
Check out my chest
Bitch I'm the best
Put so much work in I ain't gotta flex
Put me on a track and I bet I catch wreck
Just bring bread and that beat ima put it to rest
Make sure when you come that you coming correct
You gone show love or gone show me respect
Anything less I'm uping that tech
It got one In the neck
You'll get one in ya neck
I shot yo dog up so call me the vet
And if you keep on barking my nigga you next
Man you can't trust this niggas can't trust these bitches
Ever heard of a devil in a dress
Ima big dog you is a poodle so be cool
I pull up in that 2 door they all on my you know
Started from the bottom with oodles in noodles
With niggas who hustle moving weight like a sumo
Swag on the honeys they loving it
They all on my dick they want some of it
Id rather get money then fuck a bitch
But ima get money then fuck a bitch
Might fuck someone chick for the fuck of it
Her mouth on my pipe like a cluck and shit
All that was yo bitch I didn't even notice it
Man that ho know she can suck a dick
Everytime I hit the block
I keep a Glock in the car for the opps
No Ls but I'm whipping while I'm getting top
Im ballin I'm tatted up feeling like I'm PAC
Picture me Rollin while she blowing cock
She decent eating that D like a Brot
You'll think that I'm Italian the way I be styling
Now I'm finna crank it up just a notch
Straight out Chicago hip hop Picasso
Lyrically sick bitch I kick it like taboo
When I step out look like I hit the lotto
Gucci, Louie , Ralph Lauren Ferragamo
Later that night I slide dick in a model
Pussy so wet man that nigga need goggles
Sometimes I feel like a Soprano
How I be strapped I feel like desperado
Long 30 clip and it's filled up with hollows
Talking that shit and it's clapping like bravo
Got you ducking like you daffy and Donald
Body yo ass then get to my dough
Bitch I ain't rocko but I'm all about my nachos
Doing muey colossal
Just let that Glock off (bang bang) and a fuck nigga top off
Try to cross me like hot sauce
I swear to god y'all all y'all niggas act macho
Especially when they with their vatos
I got them shells if they say they want beef well come get you a taco
Everywhere I go best believe I keep my toast pussy bitch I can not go
Fire like Phyro
I shoot like my nigga Fonzo
Bitch niggas eyes closed
I think I'm Pablo
MOB still the motto
Got a bitch making drop offs tell her don't nod off
I'm 55 with that work
Call that shit cinco de mayo
Bitch I'm a mob boss
Def Starz

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

All I ever wanted was to make a fucking difference
Knew a lot that never did it
Tryna be the one who did it
Grew up in the project building
Witnessed dealings and some killings
Devil grinning with how we living
Niggas sinning just to get it
Used to go to bed at night while watching roaches on the ceiling
Taking turns with plates and fork
Because there wasn't enough dishes
Taught to share with all my siblings, If I got it they can get it
I remember watching my OG get high up in the kitchen
I remember finding pipes she hid up in the oven mitten
How I used to throw them out
The ninth floor window like I'm pitching
Then act like I never did it
Thinking that would make her quit it
I still pray to God for healing
If you're real I know you hear me (Ahhhh)

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

All I ever wanted was to make it to the top
Used to look up to my Pops, and all he played was Big and Pac
I figured if I rapped like them well maybe i could get this guap
Put me on TV, I can't see me in no can or in no box
Never thought I had to hussle, never thought I'd tote these Glocks
Never thought I fight them cases, sleeping counties on a cot
Niggas think shit funny til this 40 gets to singing, Jamie Foxx
You beef with me then bodies drop
Boy you dont want to be my opps
And I dont leave no witnesses so can't nobody can tell the cops
Niggas snitching, choppers take them out the picture when I crop
Never planned on popping pussies or nobody getting shot
But I ain't never complain about mine, Nigga you know how I rock

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

All I ever wanted, was to give my people hope
And get their backs up off the ropes
Make my people proud, keep your heads above the clouds
Bought my momma a big ol' house, I just wanna see you smile

All I ever wanted was my OG off of drugs
Used to wash clothes in the tub, Never thought I'd be the plug
All I ever wanted was to make it with this rapping
First I'll trap and get to stacking and invest and make it happen
All I ever wanted to see my niggas shine
Never thought that you would be jealous
You was hating all the time
Had that fuck shit on your mind, don't know how you was designed
But the Lord didn't make me blind, I know how to read them signs

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

I do this for the ones from the bottom that never had a chance
Straight off the porch from the slaughterhouse to the savage land
Make niggas lean if they intervene with Montana’s plans
With this big old strap round my neck I shoot like the camera man
Go call them people, I’m bodying them, no ambulance
I rolled down on em, way colder than any avalanche
This MC keep the tooly, but I don’t hammer dance
The body bags on these niggas look like some hammer pants
Man I remember them nights when my mom was getting high
She locked herself in the bathroom while a young nigga cried
At times felt helpless, didn’t give a fuck if I live or die
Some heavy praying to god and now I’m back energized
You motherfuckers don’t know the pain that I feel inside
I drop to my knees every day and thank god I’m still alive
Was ill advised, getting fly when I shouldn’t have spent a dime
Been blamed for murders, caught cases, yeah I’ve been criticized
Hunger, passion, rage, when I rap they say I’m uncivilized
I was facing nine the lord saved me right in the nick of time
Montana the truth, you just proof that the devil been a lie
Dealt with all my struggles and troubles that made a nigga wise
I’m gon make sure that my family eat when it’s dinner time
First nigga cross me, it’s over for him like finish lines
I put that clip to their back and I won’t get penalized
I put that on life, Imma turn these niggas to nigga pies
Yeah, I got these rappers on my dinner plate
You April fools don’t see the enemy
I penetrate and make these pussys hyperventilate
I ain’t got no beef cause I done murdered all my enemies
Innovate when I illustrate, straight up out the illest state
I’m the reason you niggas hate
Been schooling you niggas, too weak for me just like winter break
I been this great, this nigga made, I got more juice than minute maid
I ain’t always been this way, there’s reasons why I renegade
I make an example out you nigga, don’t make me demonstrate
Tell Satan that I’m murdering any goofy he send this way
Glock pop at your top before I let an opp get rid of me
Don’t make me do my homework, find out where that nigga stay
Cause Imma light him up the same night like Independence Day
Understand you’re playing with fire nigga
These other rappers look at me like barbed wires nigga
Got that Smith and Wesson and plus an extra clip up in my jeans
We gon make it home safe cause I got hitters on my team
I done seen some of the coldest niggas give up on their dreams
Lost they vision for the green, I seen niggas turn to fiends
I ain’t tripping, no submission, I ain’t quitting, Andrew Wiggins
I’m on mission, Russell Simmons, I go get it for my team
Put a bad bitch up in traffic, now she whipping for a king
Puppet master for the cash, I got these bitches on a string
And I ball hard till I’m fouling out, that’s why I be styling out
Cause other than my kids, shit I ain’t got too much to smile bout
Cut out all that wolfing, give a fuck bout what you howling bout
Cause I’m ready to bang like a judge pulling his gavel out
Bitch I'm made, self employed, real McCoy, toting toys
With no FOID, I destroy, I’m too poised for these boys
They annoyed by my noise, fighting, tryna raise my boys
Bitch I’m Molly, Roy, Jones
Mike Tyson mixed with Floyd
And greedy people hang around you when you promise them blessings
Would you still be loyal to god if he didn’t promise you heaven?
How would you live after you sin and God wasn’t forgiving
You say since I’m going to hell, I might as well keep on sinning
Blood sucking motherfuckers, they judging, I’m glad I ain’t you
I can’t be bought with bribes, I’m loyal because I’m thankful
I spit what’s painful, cause nigga I’m not ashamed to
Frequent conversations with the one you always pray to
Asking for forgiveness, I been whacking shit like Babe Ruth
Bitch I keep that thing glued, my lyrics is brain food
Your bitch on my dick, boy I’m the one she give that brain to
And that pussy’s so wet that I should fuck her wearing rain boots
So if you heard about a nigga super sick with the flow
Don’t beat on women but that nigga steady hitting your ho
Both of his wrists is icy, look like he been digging in snow
Run with a clique of dirty boys, on the mission for dough
Murder whenever he feel like it’s time for niggas to go
Hey that’s Montana, AKA the flyest killer you know
God
I feel like it's my, it's my uh, my responsibility to do that and to give you something good, you know. Whether they know it or not, you basically... you're a teacher. You got somebody's attention. And, you actually givin' them something. I'm finna give it to you. Every kind of way, you know, the good and the bad

Fire in my eyes, like when the stove blaze
I am the revenant, I done been through those cold days
Fighting demons, trying not to turn to my old ways
Like you lackin' traffic, I'm blasting ratchets, that's road rage
Ya'll using structures, you niggas ain't using logic
One shot in-between ya eyes, and you closing em like a closet
The afterlife isn't promised, only death, we can't dodge it
This life we live ain't forever, so make the most while you got it
Don't fry your brain with narcotics, see God is my only chronic
Your demons might bring you down, but he'll bring you up like hydraulics
I'm full of wisdom and knowledge, and sharin' it like a prophet
So love me all for my actions, not cuz of what's in my pockets
Just counted a thousand hunnids, my momma proud of her son
And she smilin' cuz now I'm buzzin'
Knew I would amount to something
She told me "all smiles ain't smiles, all grins ain't grins
Watch every nigga around you, all friends ain't friends
Don't be no fool, stay on your shit
All love ain't love, my son, all snakes don't hiss"
I got so much knowledge bottled up
Check up on me, no follow-ups
Teachin' all of my follower's
Till' they nail me like Yeshua
Look, don't sell your soul
Real nigga's don't ever fold
Just set and pursue your goals
The truth that was never told
Is they'll bribe you with cars and clothes
Shiny diamonds and gold
Performin' at hella shows
And after that, nailin' hoes
I've been grinding on my own
They can't bribe me with no loans
Before I live as a slave, I'll be dying on my throne
Don't do lying in my songs
Bitch, I'm flyer than the drones
Taking giants out they zones
Tell Goliath "bring it on!"
Rich thoughts while I'm living broke
Was sweeping, stumping, killing roaches on that kitchen floor
Sent to get eggs, but was stealing while was in the store
Went many winters with hoodies, didn't have no winter coat
Fuck that, start dealing dope
Got paper like an envelope
Was fuckin' paid, no gigolo
I swear I was so fresh that even Zest thought I invented soap
I ran into the fucking cops, fell off, had to kick a door
Lost lots of green like pigalo
I'm just thankful I'm still afloat
Remindin' God that I'm thankful, I always tell him that
While hoping the people we've lost is wherever heaven's at
And I know what that struggle like, robbin', stealin', sellin' packs
When this christmas come, your kids don't wonder where they presents at
The bar's been set, go be better than those that came before you
Flex like bodybuilders, and shine on nigga's like baby oil
But try not to slip cuz the prison system got places for you
Don't get the picture, my nigga, here let me paint it for you
The same nigga's that say they love you and claim they loyal
Ain't gon' pay no lawyers or let alone, raise your babies for you
It don't make you real cuz there's diamonds inside your damn watch
And never left your hood, and you always reppin' your damn block
And It don't make you savage cuz you be totin' no damn Glocks
Or popped it at no opps, so you ran away from no damn cops
Or sold a bunch of grams, or be standin' over them damn pots
Or you stay in the field, like them lil nigga's off Sandlot
If you don't want your momma to see you up in no damn box
Just aim straight, for that ain't cool, like Ken shamrock
Used to watch rap city, had dreams to be at the damn top
Now labels on my dick, with hopes they can get my John Hancock
Nobody famous reached out to me, or gave me no damn shot
Lately I'm adding dough to my knots, until rubberbands pop
I caught a couple gun cases that still steel with him
My fans love when I'm going in for the kill, nigga
Like hopin' out whips with them pumps if I'm on your heels, nigga
You better heal, nigga, I'm just here to heal nigga's
Give em the real, you may never know how that feels, nigga
I don't complain or chill, I got too much will, nigga
Made it this far, and I did it without a deal, nigga
Just cuz you got a dead homie don't make you real, nigga
Every man dies, but not every man lives
And I'm thankful for my banks, like I married aunt Viv'
But I'm wonderin', why is hell still a punishment?
If they say Jesus died on that cross for, every man's sins
Nobody's safe, nobody's pure, nobody's sure
Your spots a maybe, you're crazy, no spots secure
Put God first, I don't make a move unless he's involved
Fightin' demons off while I'm droppin' jewels like I've seen it all

And you need to understand that and give them something, you know, give them something good, give them something they can use. You know, here and there. Instead of giving them all this, uh, bullshit, that they want, that the majority of people want, you know

Gotta keep one on me, know I can go any day, boy
Slidin' hollow tips in the clips I can't wait to spray, boy
Magazines full of them bitches see I don't play, boy
Leave a nigga reekin' for thinkin' he Theon Greyjoy
When hope is lost, don't ever bail on your team
Don't Doubt The God and stand firm like you settin' the screen
There’s just one version of the truth you need to question your king
Sky's the limit, went from livin' in the 'jects to my dream
So fresh and so clean, it's cool to have a necklace that blings
But real leaders teach us lessons while they blessin' their teams
To live is to grind, we all on different missions to rise
Visualizin' bein' on top, I'm gon' stay willin' to climb
And none of us would value life if God didn't limit the time
We talk to clouds with hopes the ones we lost still live in the skies
You gotta show the Lord you're thankful when you're given this time
Success is proof that you've evolved and mastered difficult times
And no fish don't get to the bait because they missin' my lines
Maybe later in life when you mature, you'll get it in time
No one can ever mention bars without mentionin' mine
So sick with the rhymes, that every lyric pickin' ya mind
Some think that all they gotta do is pray for the best
Always lookin' for a shortcut and a way to finesse
King's vision, time's tickin', I ain't waitin' for next
Just like a fuckin' Chess game, bitch I'm chasin' the check
I'm an artist, hoe they on it, we get praises the best
I told them put they money up like we was makin' the bet
Gon' make 'em regret, always be real and make 'em respect
Don't get discouraged, people tend to love to hate on the best
My wisdom's unique, do you and let the critics critique
'Cause lions don't concern themselves with the opinions of sheep
Even my haters takin' notes and got my shit on repeat
It's gettin' deep like brother Malcolm out here givin' a speech
Gifted with intentions of redemptions such as healin' the weak
Put God first and never give up when you feelin' defeat
Be willin' to see, don't be another prisoner sleep
Life is a bitch and people change like that bitch named Mystique
Embracin' the pain, my nigga I was raised in the rain
Now I'm breakin' up chains, and I'm changin' the game
I do this with my eyes closed, drive a hater insane
Me and God give 'em Hell like Undertaker and Kane
And I don't depend on no man, got that from my old man
My mama told me no woman wants them a broke man
My bros said "You can make it", I said "We both can"
Came a long way, sleepin' counties, hearin' them doors slam
Used to be the dope man, every day I sold grams
Nowadays it's different, my pockets fatter than Roseanne
Big paper, I got that bag on me like the postman
Still prayin' daily, receivin' blessings in both hands
Armed with two sticks in this bitch, I feel like a snowman
Dead bodies all on your block, I turn it to ghost land
FGE the shit bitch you better get with the program
And every barbarian niggas out there think I'm Conan
Mimic when I lead on 'em, missions to succeed
Like a fuckin' backbreaker, nigga this is what they need
Punchlines like Apollo nigga, this is for my creed
Meaning this is for my seeds, I just hope you takin heed
Pray every day knowin' Satan waitin' for you to fall
I give praise to God because that's who helped me get through it all
Shawty bad as hell, yeah, check out that bitch body

Baby girl be styling, these hoes trynna copy

I feel like I'm Stephan, she my Lauren Winslow
My baby be styling, everything designer
She know she my rider, you won't find no bitch finer
Hate when I'm on the road, but she love when I'm inside her
I'm who she make time for, I whip it out, she climb up
Pin her to the wall, yeah, something like a poster
Then lay her on the bed, and do that pussy like I'm suppose to
I pull her hair and choke her, she love the way I stroke her
I pull out, no holster, and then I super soak her

Shawty bad as hell, yeah, check out that bitch body
Everything so perfect, love the way she ride me
Baby girl be stylin, these hoes trynna copy
Hella niggas jocking, but she only want my D
Shawty bad as hell, yeah, check out that bitch body

Baby girl be stylin, these hoes trynna copy
Hella niggas jocking, but she only want my D

She love to ride it
So go on, ride inside it
Make love inside it
You a pussy you get popped, no janitor I keep the mop
That bitch on me when I shop, so come my way like Fetty Wap
I slide for real I'm on your heels when I pull up no ankle socks
It's going down relax a nigga like Yung Joc straight at his top
Grew up in the 'jects, we use to hoop on them crates
Gang banging and holdin' up rakes
Start movin' that weight, was gettin' it from outer state
I chose the hustle to escape
While getting this cake, I had to kill a few snakes
I took my crookeds with my straights, hero with no cape
While making sure my people straight, I came out on top like a tank
Now bitch i'm the best, it is not up for debate
Always drop and crack like a vase, more views that a wake
I got what they want like a safe, my ex on my dick Triple H
No I'm not her man, but sometimes my belt got a H
My swagger from outer space
My new bitch is perfect, just right for me like I'm Drake
I eat that pussy like steak
She bad to the bone, she send naked pics to my phone
She keep my dick hard as a stone
Gettin' head on my throne, she lick a nigga no Patrón
Then slide on that D like a zone
I'm fly like a drone, I got to the top on my own
I didn't sell my soul to get known
Don't come at me wrong, you can get smoked like a bong
Then get yo ass put in my song
Two guns on my waist, big clips like Deandre and Blake
I slid through his home like his base
He ran like a race
Then bullets came out his face, I got out I might shoot like i'm ace
Check out my drip, whole bunch of Gs on my kicks
I look like I hit a lick
I put my niggas on, now my team inside like a pig
We on fire, we lit, call us Bic
I killed your homie,  like the Knicks
I told you i'm with the shits, 30 in my clip
I upped it and blew like a crip
But I'm Donatello with that stick
These niggas slaves, these niggas sellin' they souls
These labels pimpin' they hoes
Dyeing they hair, these niggas looking like trolls
Right now they gettin' exposed
You're not a boss, you niggas do as you're told
For the right price you will fold
I know that I'm cold, I'm bodying them like a robe
I just go in I'm like doors
I stay in my mode, bitch I stay grippin' that pole
I don't let go like 
While on the road, we caught a case with a pole
It got dropped because none of us told
Big faces, I be thumbin' through
My squad get money too
A bunch of Gs, on my fuckin' belt, and my luggage too
Take your bitch, fuck her from the back
Her dreams coming true
I fucked her good and she told all her friends
They wanna fuck me too
I put my faith, In god and my gun
I don't trust none of you
Had heat on me while I sat in class but it wasn't summer school
I shot niggas in these fucking streets then ball like Uncle Drew
I pop these pussies pill out on these bitches he Cliff Huxtable
Said I don't need a deal I make money moves
Said I don't gotta sign bitch I'm comfortable
If I see you and I don't speak well that means I don't fuck with you
It's FGE and I'm the CEO this what that money do
They never thought it would happen this rappin' stuff
Was facing cases because I got caught with gats and stuff
My haters thought I wouldn't elevate from that trappin' stuff
And fuck twelve they want me back in the back with cuffs
God knows my needs that's why I never ask for much
I work for mine I swear I never had good luck
My past was rough, my moms was high my dad was drunk
Start baggin' up, I used to feed my mattress bucks
Rap god a.k.a. hip hop's asthma pump
Don't pass I'm clutch I'm gladiator Maximus
About my bills when I spit like I'm Daffy Duck
Expose the truth then turn and tell your pastor, "church"
They want beef until I give 'em what they askin' for
They ratchet tucked Bruce Wayne the way we maskin' up
We ride with straps you niggas better fasten up
I keep the pump in my whip like I'm gassin' up
That's big sticks when we slide and we don't pass the puck
The only time they want smoke is when you pass the blunt
We on your lawn with them choppas like your grass gettin' cut
I blast, I bust, you die you just got whacked and touched
Your bitch in heat
She say she want me bad as fuck
The head was good
Deep throat like a giraffe and stuff
She gagged and sucked
Bitch damn near made me crash my truck
The ass was pumped, I did my thing I smashed, I fucked
And you ain't winning if you spendin' more than stackin' up
If you ain't mastering the math of your cash, you'll flunk
I'm FGE, them Titans scared to clash with us
I'm in my bag bitch don't ever think I'm packin' up
Way before the rappin' bitch I was trappin' I used to touch bands
I got to that bag from the floor just like a dustpan
How is there so much creativity up in one man?
Giving kids food for their thoughts I feel like a lunch man
Niggas spent their last on a pair of shoes with a jumpman
Feeling like a mill when he walk, he must be a Bucks fan
And I'm no longer stuffing pounds in the duffle, son
I stay on you 'cause I care to see you smile and I love you
If you don't add to the big picture  you won't value the puzzle
Please teach your kids that life is awesome
Sometimes allow 'em to struggle
And if they spend more than they stack
Then they won't value the hustle
If you can't nip shit in the bud and push then how you the muscle
Huh? Boss shit, call up my hitters and tell 'em tell fam
Hop out, put that strap to his head like he Quailman
Replace the hammers used and then pay him after they nail fam
What you know about killers comin' dressed as a mailman
My homie told me I really don't think they ready, fam
I bet he drop when I roll up on him just like the jelly, fam
We cuttin' I put that on my blood just like a band-aid
We comin' 'round that bitch blowing at you faster than fan blades
See, I just wanna see every one of my mans paid
Mama in the mansion relaxing, don't need a damn thing
Drinkin' lemonade with her feet up under the damn shade
Niggas didn't wanna believe me until them bands came
Knowing when I go in I'm known to go on a rampage
Madness written all over they faces like Macho Man shades
It's like, ever since I got my bag right (woo!)
All these bitches wanna act nice
It's money over bitches I'm pimpin' 'em like a Cadillac
Bitches know I'm lit yeah I got 'em drippin' like candle wax
Thinkin' 'bout the top, reachin' for my belt like a ladder match
He say he want smoke plus his bitch on my pipe, I had to crack
Rap god, baby, my lyrics could cure cataracts
Arsonal just said, "niggas lucky that you don't battle rap"
The fake be flippin' sides for that money just like an acrobat
The real ones gonna ride through them ups and downs
Like a camel's back
One life in God's house
Ain't no second life where the attic at
From the struggle I had to grind to get out my habitat
Orange and green buds by the pound
It's looking like Apple Jacks
Four hundred forty-eight
When I package that, clients back to back
Matter of fact, only you pussy niggas get mad at facts
I put that on my sons it ain't really nothin' to have you whacked
If Kris Kross, he can get thirty up out they Daddy Mac
That's thirty for you haters, I'm shooting tell 'em come hack-a-Shaq
Pictures with my kids in my cribs ain't no need to caption that
Ain't nothin' like the hugs from your cubs
When they know they daddy back
My daughter mother strapped, .22 in that Gucci fanny pack
Plus I dropped a bag on her kicks, nigga that's hacky sack
G-O-D my chauffeur he opened that damned door for us
Labels ain't controllin' us, ballin' like no one's holdin' us
Every line's potent that's why they come get they dope from us
And this is not a brothel, I promise you ain't no hoe in us
Big choppas, takin' off tops, that's can openers
The bullets in my clip, yellin', "pussy come get a load of us"
Teflon in my jacket, I'm Spawn with that ratchet
Put pawns in a casket, who wants to get it crackin'?
I'm a hundred like Wilt, tell your nigga he ain't built
If he act rowdy I'ma pipe her, then that nigga gettin' killed
Skrrt off up in traffic bitch I'm smooth like silk
Left him wet and what came out that .40 cal wasn't milk
Know your part, go home if you ain't goin' hard
The coldest art that's ripping rappers' souls apart
Came from the bottom I ain't going back like Rosa Parks
These other rappers don't compare to me like Noah's Ark
(x2)
It ain't nothin' but that bullshit on shorty brain
Don't think that shorty playin', look how shorty came
You see that 30 clip up off that 40 hang
Shorty let that 40 bang, let that 40 bang

Niggas think that it's a game, let that 40 bang
Let em know that you ain't playin', let that 40 bang
Put that thang up to his brains, let that 40 bang
Now everybody in the city sayin' shorty name
Gettin' scared everytime that they see shorty out
Hopin' he don't pull that mutha fuckin' 40 out
Cause they know he don't give a fuck, they know that shorty wild
Only two words that he know(what's that), that's 40 cal
30 clip extended, if he feel offended
Shorty squeezin' that trigger, til that mutha fucka empty
That's just how he do it, he know what he doin'
Once he off that 40, ain't no talkin' bitch he shootin'
Tear drops all in his face and in his trigger fingers
All he need is his 40 and his trigger fingers
Fuck a fuck nigga and fuck what that nigga thinkin'
Come to his spot and air him out, leave that nigga stinkin'
(x2)
It ain't nothin' but that bullshit on shorty brain
Don't think that shorty playin', look how shorty came
You see that 30 clip up off that 40 hang
Shorty let that 40 bang, let that 40 bang

He tatted up like tunechi, stay up in some gucci
Prolly in a black wing, he hop up out that hooptee
Then he get excited, cause you niggas look like groupies
All you niggas pussy, watch that 40 cal eat coochie
Where shorty from my nigga everyday is doomsday
So he stay with that 40 like they roommates
Hit up the block and let that mutha fuckin tool spray
And leave all you niggas lyin', April fool's day
He be on that killa shit, shorty far from innocent
You know what the business is, one of yo niggas been a vic
Right now you fuckin with a nigga that don't give a fuck
Ain't talkin phone numbers when I say shorty hit em up
It's 300, you already know what they're about
2 steps, find out his whereabouts and air him out
Now he flexin' on you niggas Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to reach for shorty chain, watch my 40 bang
(x2)
It ain't nothin' but that bullshit on shorty brain
Don't think that shorty playin', look how shorty came
You see that 30 clip up off that 40 hang
Shorty let that 40 bang, let that 40 bang

If them niggas want beef, let that 40 bang
If them niggas think it's sweet, let that 40 bang
Ain't gotta meet me in the streets to let that 40 bang
I'll bring that shit to where you sleep, let that 40 bang(BANG!!!)
Came in the game as a young nigga tryna' get guap
From the land of the dark play it smart or yo' ass get popped
Gotta roll with the pole in the van with the bros totin' Glocks
Had to grind to the top non-stop now we got shit locked

Real nigga checkin' in
Pounds of that loud is what I was investing in
Ambitious as I've ever been
I sold specimens while I was fly like a pelican
Rap god you know how I'm rockin' the devil keep knockin' I try not to let him in
I give hell to the demons that's meddlin' only a fool talk shit with no evidence
They sick in the head like ring worms & speakin' the truth is the medicine
Kidnap em for questionin', then watch him go nuts in the trunk like an elephant
He gon' talk David Letterman, while you beg for yo' life don't insult my intelligence
Make you open yo' mouth, stick my weapon in light your shit up I think I'm Thomas Edison. AH!
Started off in my dad's house, then to the trap house once I started getting that cash out
Garbage bags full of weight but to my next door neighbors look like I was takin' the trash out
Turn my pain and my struggle into hustlin' bubble now I got that bag now
I get paid just to spazz out, lyrics so hot when I made them thank god I didn't pass out
What's your IQ in the streets what you gon do with this beef Think everything cool you gon see better learn how to move with the heat
I lay right by my tool when I sleep, ready to put two in a creep
Then they cover you up with sheets, link back up with my crew then we eat


Bitch I'm a maverick, used to do magic with a pencil and a tablet
Now I got it mastered, my craft is vast and shapeless these haters can't grasp it
I been had that bag bitch, all up in traffic, flipping money like gymnastics
If shit got as dry as a desert no joke couple niggas got poked like a cactus
Man I'm too galactic never lost focus real niggas they don't get distracted
Haters not in my bracket, they gon need; Jesus, themself, and a whole lot of practice
They think they gon' come up off dissing me
They cannot fuck with me lyrically
I make whoever hear me remember me
I black out then I go on a killing spree
I got bars like they sentence me no penitentiary, I know these fuck niggas sick of me
My .45 got a lemon squeeze, I be swaggin' like I come from Italy
I told bro and em get money by any means
Then show them what I meant like parentheses
I made Benjamin Franklin sprint to me, we so close you would think he's some kin of me
Oh yeah I had some friends turn to enemies, then I turned Two-face into Mr. Freeze
I showed up but I didn't show no sympathy
Pussy niggas got smoked like a chimney
I come from the land where it's dark at
Had to learn how to swim where them sharks at
They sell rocks on the blocks all while dodgin' the cops, totin' Glocks and the opps who we spark at
(Sniffles)
Do you Smell that?
Do You?
(Sniffles)
It smells like smoke?
Is it a fire?
There’s a fire in the church!

This is that call from your plug saying the drought is over
I'm gods most ruthless and wildest soldier, my style ferocious
While y'all was drinking and y'all was smoking, this child was sober
Spitting more fire on tracks than dragons with halitosis
Flood in the game like the rain that never showered Noah
Piling my dough up, them pounds was coming from South Dakota
Had garbage bags of that loud as strong as the foulest odor
Had a long road to success, that bitch wasn't right around the corner
Know times got hard I still vowed to blow up like loud explosions
While counting dough up stood next to sinners like power forwards
From West street niggas get murdered before they child will grow up
With hopes he'll come back like Jesus, but highly doubt he'll show up
Hustled with homies from high school, fell out, and now it's over
Used to love whips with big rims, so haters we towered over
All white seats inside the Chevy, looking like powdered donuts
You should've seen how the crowd would go nuts
They bow before us
I used to dream of being paid like this, I
Got hella tracks that I done slayed like this, I
Never thought I'd get out that maze like this
Ain't never changed up, Montana always stayed like this, see
These other rappers, they ain't made like this, no
You gotta read to turn the page like this
All praise the god, they ain't know that he made grenades like this
And niggas hate but even Jesus had days like this (wooh!)
So much Fire in the Church, the choir had a heatstroke
Youngin' got the streets sewed, let my haters deep-throat
.40 in my pea-coat, slide on em' like a ski slope
Change em' like a remote, place em' in that deep hole
Right now I'm in beastmode, it's like I got a cheat code
I see another side of the door, just like a peephole
I keep my guard up cause GOD ain't the author
I wear my pain like it's armor, my battles just made me smarter
A murderer like my father, two straps on me like a farmer
Clip to your head like a barber, I bus yo ass like a charter
Come back around like I'm karma, then witnesses gettin' slaughtered
Take off like dearly departure, flow hard, that bitch need a carpet
I got a lil bitch from Spartus, slid in her walls like a charger
Plus I can have a Minaj with two sisters like I was Roger
Yeah, both of them wanna do me, they sweat a nigga like Coogi
One black, the other one mixed, call em' bitches Scooby and Snoopy
Got groupies tryna pursue me, I'm good, I'll pass on that coochie
Plus, lust is the death of duty, I'm grindin' till God remove me
When it's go time, I blow mine, I'll be in and out in no time
And that newspaper gon' cosign, that I shows up when it's showtime
I'll kill your ass and then say shit, like God said it was your time
If you niggas want it then mo-dime, blow their brains out, I don't mind
Been shootin' shit like Kodak, niggas used to ask me, "where the hoes at?"
I was gettin' money way before rap, I was hustlin', movin' dro packs
And I made a decision, I lost all my mother's conditions, while I never sold crack
Only givin' truth, tell em' hoes that
Touchin' more souls than a doormat
And I wonder where my life would be, if God wasn't on the side of me
Responding to me quietly, enhancing my psychiatry
I fight demons daily, baby, Satan's still my rivalry
Declinin' all his bribery, the lord would never lie to me
Fact was in the argument, and you don't have to die to see
I've broadened my horizon, like I'm watchin' from the highest tree
My words hold the truth, I got shit locked, just like a diary
I put my own self on nigga, I should get a finder's fee
This world is cold, I'm pourin' more, restorin' souls, applyin' heat
The more we know, the more we blow, now picture hip-hop minus me
They hate behind my back, tip-toe and whisper while the giant sleeps
My videos, they spy and creep, see me, show love, and try to speak
God told my squad it's time to eat, I can't help who ain't grind with me
All honesty and modesty, all while I built my dynasty
What lies beneath, disguised as sheep, the wisest beast, surprise it's me
Defined elite, designed with ink, my fine physique looks kind of Greek
My minds unique, sometimes discrete, and I just want the blind to see
That God does not have hiding spots, so nigga this ain't hide and seek
You only pray to God when you want something, so your bond is weak
I pray to tell him thank you just for blessing me beyond belief
Like him, I'm who they dyin' to meet, play games with me, that price is steep
I'm sleepin' them like private suites, he'll get shot, Hepatitis B
Like anything with value nigga, what's on the inside is key
Righteously, I try to be, shine light on that side of me
I spit what I take in, can't keep it down, like fuck who tryna sleep
Plus, Fire in the Church just dropped, and every rapper died this week
God!
Shawty go nuts she go crazy

Makin moves so my family can benefit
Even the paralyzed say that they feelin this
No Bruce Jenner fool nigga you been a bitch
And your girl treat my dick like it's licorice
First she blow me and then I slide in bitch I been in that game like my name Sega Genesis
If you start with a gangster I'll finish it
Put an end to shit then I'll act innocent

All my bullets gon sing like the opera

When it go Bracca

My broski just sold me a fresh Glock
Green light on that bitch like an xbox
I pull up and hop out no rest stop
And then I throw bullets like Prescott
I keep a bandana like xPac
Bandanas and guns like I'm Rambo
I never run out of ammo
I got more soul than a dance floor
No bitch I cannot be your man though
You know I stay lit like a candle
20 bands up in my pants ho
I got my dough up like a lambo
From the slaughterhouse boy I will slaughter you
Bangers and bitches on me when I'm walking through
You get wet like Poseidon when I come through
Slide and your death will be so mythological
I got bodies so watch who you talking to
Those who play will get changed like an audible
I put all of you up in an article
Then go sauce on your bitch honey barbecue
So shawty go nuts she went crazy
She was cleaning my pipe tryna drain me
Money changing but I'm still the same me
When them fuck niggas die boy they blame me

Shawty go nuts she go crazy
I got these bitches wet cause I'm wavy
They wanna go half on a baby
I can't fuck with you bitch you fugaze
I will drip on a bitch like I'm raining
I got guns like I'm up in the navy
Keep 1 on me like Tracy McGrady
Dirty dancin' bitch I'm Patrick Swayze
I decided to dedicate myself to hip-hop
And to everyone that's a product of it

No need to worry

My conscious told me
Come like this and bring that pain wit’cha
Keep faith in God and make sure that you keep that thang wit’cha
You got a purpose
Don't sit around like these lame niggas
Y'all ain't the same
Jus’ cuz y'all came from the same trenches
If they ain't fight in that fire
Stand in that rain wit’cha
Then they ain't wit’cha
Don't let ‘em get on that plain wit’cha
Make sure the ones you call Broski Nem on that same mission
Stay alive and stay focused
Stay out that cage, nigga
Heart of a hustler
It's pumpin all in ya veins, nigga
Don't smoke or drink
But yo’ high is when you on stage, nigga
Remain humble
And blow up like a grenade hit’cha
And never change
No matter how hard the fame hit’cha

No need to worry

Triggers yo’ stimulation
Long as I'm feeding my brain
It ain't no limitation
The greatest flow in the building
I'm hip-hop's renovation
My day one homie jus told me
Tony don't give me Nathan
It feels amazing just seeing
One of my niggas make it
And then I thanked him
For being loyal and never changing
Remaining true and not being
One of dem niggas hatin'
I came a long way from rappin'
Inside of niggas basements
Promised my girl
Ima get us up out this situation
Cut back on sinning
And changed the way I was living
So my sons ain't have to come see they daddy in prison visitations

No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now

These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now

Hip-hop ain't never seen such
They gon’ remember his wrapping
Like he was he was King Tut
Yo’ favorite rappers couldn't match me if they teamed up
It's FGE, bitch, we take pictures wit our Wings Up
I took the shot, I had to take to put my team up
I pushed some packs and made racks
And let them things bust
Flow like the Devil with sickle-cell
That's sick as hell
Rap God gone bless you
And rescue you like I’m Chip n Dale
Hip-hop ain't dead
Watch me save that bitch with my hard drive
It's only right
Cause she saved me from all my hard times
I can’t forget you
My heart and soul's what I give you
Uplift you with what I been through
And when U gone I’m gon’ miss you

Never threw in towels
Made my goonies proud

Fucked up in my head
Got shot in the neck, but now that nigga dead
You heard what I said
You think this a game?
Well come on and play it
I'm hoppin' out sprayin'

Leave your mama prayin'
30 and that 40 50 in that FN Nina

If you don't got my bands, then someone gettin' stretched again
Kickin' in a door, lifting up my pole, then I'm steppin' in
I get that, that click clack, got kickback, 3 ninjas
If he in the crowd, when that 50 spit, then don’t get whacked, he injured
I wish niggas would, I swing choppers, like lumberjacks, then timber
If your foot soldiers want war, then I'm gon' send shells, that's Splinter

These niggas poppin' like bitches
Soon as he jump, it's like bungee, but bodies drop, that's the differenceAnd these just not my niggas, it's more than gang gang gang

Savage with a dollar sign, cause I'm runnin' up a check
But when I shoot, bang bang, nothin' but the net
30 in the clip and it got one up in the net
I'm aiming at you turnin' up, television set
Pull up on your block, tinted windows, black paint
They sayin', "Who's that" like I'm playin' for the Saints
Come up with my jacket, double breasted, Max Payne
Finna kill a brother like I'm Abel and Kain
Smoke 'em like some Jane
All black like Bruce Wayne
Then I take off like a plane
His homie said look out, like a window when it bang
These shots got no fatigue, it's too late, it hit his brain
Homie tried to run, no synonym, yeah he get the same
I blow like Cain, caught him with the range, left him by his range
I probably hit his main, then I rock the shirt, say I feel the same
Shorty it's not a game, shoot him like a picture, put him in a frame

Every time I come around your city, bang bang!
Everything, no less than 50, bang bang!

I make bitches in your city scream like Sidney when they trip
If you see me, come get with me if you really with the shits
I don't internet like Drizzy and Meek Milly with this shit
Curtis Jackson in my ratchet I got 50 in my clip
If I give your ass a day, you won't live to see the fame
You want to explain, but I want to see your brains
Been there, done that, you don't want none of that
Cock my gun back, let it bang
I be with a bunch of crooks, nigga
One in the neck, like a crook, nigga
When I come around, open up a round, like a hook, nigga
Slide on them squares, like a rook, nigga
All headshots, yearbook, nigga
Blowin' like a ref, with this fuckin' tec
Like a fuckin' chef, I cook niggas
Body bag him up, like some kush, nigga
Wet that pussy up, that's douche, nigga
Got your day one homies, all shook, nigga
Now they talkin' 'bout, he was a good nigga
Whatchu know 'bout standing in the cold waitin'
'Bout to give it to him, like a donation
Gun clappin', like a standing ovation
Been droppin' niggas, no probation
Squad

Everything, no less than 50, bang bang!
You better hide, you know I'ma slide, bang bang!
When I ride it's gon' be a homicide, bang bang!

When I ride it's gon' be a homicide, bang bang!
I put in that work young nigga livin' his dreams
I came out them trenches like Sting
Remember them days when I used to sit on them swings
And watch niggas dealin' to fiends
They served to my mama wish I had a burner to pop 'em
You don't know the feeling it brings
I feel like the Hulk I used to have rips in my jeans
But I had to get to the green
I swallowed the odds, because I'm anointed with God
The devil can't get in between
Gripping my chrome while I sit on my throne
Tell them niggas come on ain't no killin' the king
You'll die in the summer for talking that shit in the spring
So fall down like you sipping that lean
If you ain't from here you the visiting team
You gon' leave in a stretcher ain't no limousine
Brace yourself for the truth it may hurt a bit
The good thing about pain is you learn from it
Make sure your desire survives through the fire
The disappointment and discouragement
Better move like you know what your purpose is
Never say die, learn to fly through that turbulence
Stop placing the blame you say it's God's
But really you don't know whose word it is
Gotta know who the serpent is know they oppress us
That bitch got more game than a tournament
In the church is the prayer from your preacher
That's program gets paid to perform at the services
If it ain't ether cancel it verses ain't tampered with
Rap god and my word is permanent
I pack heat in my head like a perm in it
So you know how I roll like a percocet
One thing for certain is whoever purchased this
Gone say it's worth it he murdered it
Don't forget so we know what we working with
If they try it we riot like Ferguson
Earthquake so I step on your stomping grounds
When it come to my kids I don't fuck around
Do whatever to not hear they stomach growl
Play with mine you gon' learn how that thunder sounds
Bitch you better be real good at ducking down
Before you know what it's like to sleep underground
If you'd like then my .40 could dumb it down
I'm so cold I could cool any summer down
Took my time gave it thought like a chess move
Weigh my options then go make my best move
I do this shit for my fam
I took that shot for my blood like a flesh wound
Never answering questions no press room
Talking foul might get hit with this tech soon
So don't get me pissed 'cause I'll go do that shit
And then go wash my hands like a restroom
Give your bitch the business like a manager
Pussy pink beat it up 'til it's lavender
How I fuck she gon' think he was amateur
I don't smoke I don't drink I got stamina
I'm a boss I got all of the sauce
So these hoes in my face want a taste like a sampler
Tell my haters they not my of caliber
I get checks on you squares like a calendar
Bitch I ate off the web no tarantula
Dragon spit now I'm rich as a Lannister
I am killing all rappers it's massacre
When I drop yo' Baywatch like she Pamela
Better get out or dodge I ain't talkin' 'bout cars
When I tell you I'm whippin' all challengers
I held onto the Lord and I felt the support
Every step of the way like a banister
Life's a bitch but I know how to handle her
I stay strapped down to ride like a passenger
And I'm good with the mop and if I spot a opp
I hop clean on his ass like a janitor
So you better wise up 'cause it's overdue
Be a fan of reality know the truth
Go look far and look deep like an ocean view
But be cautious when they cannot show you proof
When it seems like it's hell that you going through
And them devil's demons got a hold of you
Gotta let ambition take control of you
Watch God open that door and then show for you
So just embrace the pain
And smile in the face of the rain
When them clouds coming over you
And watch who you selling to, not only that, man
You gotta watch who's on that boat with you
And if they didn't roll with you
Don't let them roll with you
Listen, I do not mean smoke with you
And it don't mean a nigga won't snitch
Just because he was broke with you
And he would blow for you
I've seen niggas tell on they homies
Just 'cause they'd feel better
If it was the both of you
And yeah, you love your family and friends
But sometimes it's important
To let them hear no from you
I stay ready whenever I'm rolling through
When a snake has no options he'll go for you
Rap god I'm goat to you, bringing that dope to you
You niggas wish that I wrote for you
Started rapping with bro like we Outkast
Do a show then I feed my account cash
I came up off the floor like a bounce pass
So don't call me unless it's about cash
I'm fucking eating no Ramadan
I fucked a Muslim on Ramadan
I was trapping wasn't working no nine to five
The pizza I was selling wasn't no Papa John's
Selling with my niggas like I'm a star
Guns and drugs was the shit that we idolized
I stay ready to blow and this shit not for sure
Bitch I fire up this pole then I'm popping mine
No talking no sparking there's blood everywhere
So you already knowing what's popping, slime
I'll teach you a lesson with my Smith & Wesson
Boy, don't make me take you to Columbine
Y'all know how I'm rocking
My rocket got 34 haters
I'm Hakeem Olajuwon
When I slide I'ma blow like a hockey ref
Put his ass in the box if he out of line
Rap god the phenomenon God is my confidant
I'm way too smart to run out of lines
You'll never see me like Conor McGregor vs. Mayweather in the octagon
I just take names like a dotted line, then go kill everyone I could find
Niggas don't wanna see me like father time, pulling up in that van like a soccer mom
Sliding drums in my guns when it's choppa time, then I let that bitch sing like it's Chaka Khan
My K waving hello, I stay with the metal, was raised in the ghetto
I ain't finna settle, I came here to bless you
Let's pray for the devil, he ain't on my level

Moment of silence, let's pray for the blind
Someone you never met is who made up your mind
See the way you designed, ain't the way of the wise
And the way you designed, ain't the way to survive
It's either one of two things
Jesus Christ ain't ever coming or he just like taking his time
Told you earthlings to obey your earthly master
Boy, you don't see the hate in the lies?
And to fear him and tremble as if he was Christ
That ain't godly that's Satan disguised
Pussy ass niggas saying I ain't got no bodies haha
They gonna make me go back to the old me
WOO

Mask off, you niggas mad soft
"Please help me God", that's gon' be your last thought
I shoot em up, like a rocket, blast off
Im on your ass after I blast, I do the dash and smash off
That road is dark, asphalt
Get nailed like Jesus if your pussy ass cross
I see through that shit you talking, like a fuckin' glass jaw
And you should take a fucking bow, you rappers actors, Shad Moss
The price to win is to go work your ass off
If you don't get it, I'm gon' it you gon' get yo ass moss'd
If you still looking for God, well thats because your ass lost
He's within you, y'all don't get it like a fucking bad toss
No longer broke, like I just took my cast off
Before the fame bitch, I been and had sauce
Pounds of dro, I had to get that gas off
I used to pray on the highway that I don't get my ass caught
I left the trap, took off a rap, I splash sauce
$2800 what my Gucci bag cost
Come take a picture, I'm so bright that you could take your flash off
I treat your bitch like a baton, she will get hit then passed off
I know you sick and you nauseous
Imposters mock us, they not us
Same niggas always hating, always watch us
Fuck niggas tryna knock us, won't prosper
Word to my mom I'm bout drama
You won't rob her son, I'm not Oscar
You niggas sweeter than peach cobbler
Space Jam, my roster's got monsters
Shoot like Spike Lee coming with the choppas
Might be slightly off of my rockers
Might pop your medulla oblongata
Shots turn you flodgers into dodgers
Leave you lyin' there dead, like Mufasa
My lyrics liver like shather
Evert beat I touch is gonna get conquered
I go unconscious, I go bonkers
I snap like lobster, rap god
I got way more flavour than mambas
Fly til I die like La Bamba
They see my swagger persona
Wanna jack it, like a bomber
My own logo on my joggers
Lots of green on me like Blanca
My pockets fatter than E Honda
I'm about my business, come proper
Labels can't call me like Shaka
My words can heal like a doctor
My guns turn dreads into pasta, uhhhunn
Talking like he gotta steel body
Out of arms reach, they be real cocky
3 gun cases, steel still by me
Real tear drops, real bodies
When I'm poppin his ass, like a lil Molly
They gon' claim I hit him, no Bill Cosby
Leave his head red, drop dead Fred, they gon' think somebody killed Lil Yachty
Cut out the flexing, you ain't built, you ain't a wrestler
But kick it off and I'll return it, Devin Hester
I put that steel on you pussy cats, like Sylvester
Blowing like a ref like I'm showing them how that tech work
Your girl probably never told you I f'ed her
She sucked my dick, so you know I know how that neck work
They way her neck jerk, I swear she was an expert
I promise I could make her give my crew neck like a sweatshirt
Dick-riding, obviously you're the expert
You probably cum on yourself if I told you lets work
And since my name on the song, it'll be your best work
We are not the same, you lame, go check my net worth
Stop barking nigga, Im Jordan, Pippin
You're pussy ass ain't starting nigga
I'm pulling up and parking nigga
Hopping out and sparking nigga
Cold with the Tommy, put a funny nigga on TV like Martin nigga
When I cross his ass, imma drop his ass, then cook his ass, James Harden nigga
AAAAHHHH
Free my nigga J Real man
FGE shit, Rap God
Finna kill 4 remixes in one day
First remix since a nigga been home from jail
Uhhuuhh
Got money in two different cities I was selling packs
Three pistol cases even 12 know that I never lack
Yo FGE! Ain't it a blessing?
We put God first 'stead of complaining and stressing
How we came up from nothing hustlin' now we fly like the Jetsons
Ain't it a blessing that we're free and still in each other’s presence
Yo G-O-D, thanks for the blessing
When 12 searched us and found that Smith & Wesson
They locked us up and asked us questions
Tried to change the direction
My niggas didn't let 'em finess 'em for a fuckin' confession
Uhhuh
Kick doors in my Timbos, uppin' big poles
Get smacked with the pistol, leave your shit swole
Fall back nigga limbo if it ain't ten-fold
Pop that pussy like a nympho or a pimp hoe
Still reminiscing on them days when I was broke as hell
Till I set grams up on the scale yeah I had dro for sale
Didn't get high off my supply so I was smoking L's
I had shit planned I never thought that I would go to jail
Be reading books and doing push-ups in a holding cell
Had CO's bringing me bundles of all my open mail
I know the system's against us and we supposed to fail
The white walkers amongst us youngers is cold as hell
They came to my block I was plottin' bitch I was loading shells
Brought toys to school inside my bookbag it wasn't show and tell
You niggas hate 'cause I'm speaking facts and I'm dope as hell
You should've seen them crackers faces when I posted bail
Been fighting demons all my life I swear I know 'em well
I'll take your life then act surprised if I do go to jail
Came from a portal, Rap God I'm immortal
Tats on my torso got cheese like Digiorno
Pockets like bolo whores (horse) on me no polo
I roll up no yo-yo then cut like I'm Zoro
This monster is armed thats on foenem no Goro
Leave pussy wet watch me do it no porno
Tony always beast and you niggas know that's the mode he in
Trippin' splashing sauce on your TV like Nickelodeon
Ballin' like I'm Kobe and Mike on 'em like a podium
Broski blowin loud like a dynamite no Napoleon
Foreign thing, all on my dick, shawty Cambodian
Don't slip I'll come with that mop, like a custodian
When I show up niggas shut up they don't know what he on

Try to run up, ran up on him in the mornin', made that bitch go brrap
Try to pull it with my niggas pullin' triggers, boy yo ass gon' die
All facts, no lie, put that strap to his neck, bowtie
Get smoked like a cluck
Like asthma I come with that pump
Don't get your ass popped like a trunk
Flow cold like a hockey rink but I will slide like a puck
Pull up sprayin' like I was a skunk
I don't give no fuck
It's fuck all you niggas like Trump
Like Donald bitch, you better duck
Was runnin' your mouth, now you ran out of luck
I pull up like a garbage man, hop out and dump
Don't get your ass slumped

No smoke, no smoke
You boys don't want no smoke (no smoke)
I'm fresh like soap
Yo hoe gon' let me poke (no smoke)

I'm too much to press
Step down and get swept down
Like fuckin' stairs
Leggo my eggo, how I like cuttin' squares
One click I'ma load a clip, I'm about to go live
Get spent like 90 cents, that's two shots from the 45
That way they can't drop no dimes, get it?
Thats a hunnid nigga no lies, like a nigga really know God
Livin, but the truth said so free and I'm so fly
I walk in a spirit, like I was born a ghost
And I'm no magician, but I'll get you gone in smoke
Dock like you on a boat, see headshots in your horoscope
Boy I'm rock like boilin' coke
Ever think that you can horn a goat, better realize you on a slope
Shit'll go down, like bundles we roll out
Red dots on your nose, clown
Fireman, you get hosed down
Watch you shake like it's cold out
Hail Mary on the go route
How we scorin, who runnin'
We always go 100, yeah
And the worst when I catch up and leave you like I'm forgettin' something
And then I get back to my sense, I mean, it's back to the money
Legend on the mic I preserve, then wrap it like a fuckin' mummy
And I do it for the ones who love me
And those who came out that muddy
Want change, haters get the nickel
Thats the thing, it cap for the dummies
See, levelin' up it's a specialty
Go hard or go home it's the recipe
I been outcast like a refugee
Know that water like I trot the seven seas
So I plan to ball hard in every league
On guard with them clips like I'm beverly
Callin' all the bullshit like a referee
And I kick this shit off like a special team, squaa

FGE shit man, y'all know how squad comin' man

Yo bitch said she want the D, oh, watch out for that tree

Smarter than what you think, I get shit done in a blink
Gotta hit her with that tommy, bring that power where you sleep
R.I.P. Prodigy I be with Mob, like I'm Deep
Won't spend on niggas like linen
Flex on 'em from the beginnin'
Talkin' bout hoes on my dick, I got a lot like a dealer

I bet them bitches gon' wait on me

Yeah!
FGE shit, Mob shit
You know we run this shit
You know what it is, big pimpin' since a little nigga
Life's a gamble, I just get my cards, and I deal with it
Shake them haters off, take that shit just like a boss
I lost homies I lost money but I never took a loss
Comin' from the jungle with them alligators no Lacoste
Come through all black like the Raiders throwin' bullets, Derek Carr
Long range, and you bitches know my name
If you wanna play them games with me
Nigga you can die, like it's Saw
Put them targets on yo jaws, put your brains on the walls
Just so I can see that goofy ass shit that you thought
Knock you off and beat the case, they catch me I do the race
Real shit, Will Smith I'm an enemy of the state
I got hitters in the NO they blitzin' shit like the Saints
Do this shit so confidential, knock you off them tinted windows
Wash it down return the rental while I'm laughing to the bank
Big cash, big gold chain, chrome pistol
Fly Guy, sub-zero 'cause a nigga kicks cold
Niggas change, bitches change, you know how this shit go
Live fly, if a nigga try, put him in the sky
On these beats, ain't no other niggas eatin' like mine, squaa

Rap God, FGE shit man

Got more game than season passes
Stay up in expensive shit and I ain't talkin' Caesar's Palace
Dress and drip no caesar salad
Haters mug ain't even savage
Lookin' hard no reading glasses
Easily could lead to caskets
I got this shit mastered like Leroy
I been in my glo like I'm Sho'nuff
These pussy niggas got no nuts
These niggas gayer than gold dust
Don't none of my shooters give no fucks
For they bread they gon' pop up with toasters
For that dough they put holes in you, doughnuts
You don't wanna meet up it ain't cold cuts
With this draco nigga I'm cold as ice
They disrespectful but when I show up I swear they so polite
I ain't with the talking big choppas on me no overbite
I bet I shoot the crap out them bitches like I was rolling dice
Turned 'em into packs, I had to murder me some cats
Left big shells on the ground that's Ninja Turtles on they backs
Bitch I'm saucy you just salty, I got flavor every season
And I'm ballin', bitch I got them blue faces like Lance Stephenson
I water the seeds that I've planted until I'm under Earth
I push my son on that court like he Jesus Shettleworth
Some winners fail but don't be a quitter, there's nothing worse
Possess a hunger so strong that your fucking stomach hurt
Rap God, I'm who they call the man, I'm so fly never gotta walk again
But if I ever do I just bought some land, I take all your bitches
Turn them all to fans
I be saucin' when I hit the mall with bands
Fifty thousand in my jogger pants

All these weak rappers man I had to hit the kill switch
Bet I see them mills' with no deal that's the real lick
I am more than drill bitch, I am more than skill bitch
I only talk that real shit and all I know is kill shit
I am more than ill, motherfuckers call me real sick
Niggas get the chills when I step out on the field bitch
I ain't never lackin' nigga not even a lil' bit
Gucci on my waist, nigga you know where the steel sit
Understand this rapper not a actor I ain't Will Smith
So if you judge me wrong it's RIP to Uncle Phil bitch
40 bus' yo ass like a mothafuckin' field trip
Smoke a nigga, turn him into Fire Marshall Bill quick
Leave a nigga sleeping quicka' than a nyquil
Shoulda' cut a niggas throat with a blade give him gill slits
Poke a nigga, soak a nigga on some Navy Seal shit
Niggas know I been sick, niggas know I been raw
And on these tracks I go stupid like a send off
And you ain't fuckin' with me and even all of your homies know
That I infect two niggas with Polio with this Holy Ghost
When that Holy Ghost drops I promise imma' rock the nation
It's a biblical, lyrical, rocket launchin' proclamation
Tell my haters I said fuck em' they can't stop the operation
Tell the ops I'm not a doctor, therefore I ain't got the patience 
And the piece be on a nigga like as-salamu alaykum
On they seven combination the darkest abomination
Every time a chopper spray shit take away from population
And I ask her for forgiveness, yeah, but hold that conversation
Not a Christian, Muslim, Mason and never ridin' with Satan
A relationship with God is my number one obligation
And, if I'm not mistakin', I swear all of y'all was hatin'
Hope like Hell that I don't make it up until I drop that Chiraq
Now they wanna' dick ride, do that till' they climax
Old bitches poppin' up, nah we can't rewind that
Old homies poppin' up, we can't get that time back
These other rappers' minds will never be where my mind's at
Labels on my heels bout' a deal, I ain't buyin' that
Show me ten mill', then show me where I sign at
Nigga I know my worth I swear you niggas shoulda' stayed in school
I got em' hatin' more than Ice offa' Paid In Full
RIP my nigga Sonny, I be on some mix shit
They took my nigga from us uh, right before Christmas
Damn, now my niece got a daddy on the wish list
And Santa can't bring him back, shit he can't even get gifts
So I'm goin' hard with this music shit till' I get rich
Hey Sonny, yo I got you, shit good as God is my witness
Hatred is contagious and jealousy is a sickness
Watch everybody and ain't no tellin' who on that bitch shit
Sam's Club baby, niggas know we totin' big shit
AK47's and MAC-11's with big clips
When I cock it back it look like I'm drivin' a stick shift

Slid on a nigga for rappin', talkin' that slick shit
Bang, bang, put two in that rapper just like a Twix bitch
This rap shit is my sixth sense, rappers notice eviction
I am hip-hop's redemption, can't you feel the suspension, nigga?
Prod. By I Am Billard

FGE shit man, you already know what time it is
Gonna air this bitch out
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRAA

Bitch I'm the terminator, antisocial, word to my neighbors
I heard that they heard I made it, done cut off they circulation
I remember pushing packs up in restaurants serving waiters
I've been 300 so long that even the Persians hate us
It's food for thought when I spit, I ain't talking regurgitation
All my features hella hot like they purchased the verse from Satan
No matter how hard life gets, I'mma put in that work today
When I come up I praise the lord like I live in the church's basement
I'll purge on the world and take it, then pick up the earth and shake it
Now you fixing to get killed like the person that's nursing Jason
Come get you, I'll find a way
On your ass, like no time to waste
I'll get to dropping, start blowing my pistols, like bombs away
Fuck 12, they won't find a trace
Closed casket, they'll hide your face
God is good, God is great, bitch I'm rare, I'm like God's mistake
If God is fake like April fools, well I guess someone lied to me
No matter how much truth I find, I will always find time to pray
Like NBA it's safe to say that I've been blessed with the mic
These other rappers turn em up, but they not blessing em right
I spit the truth, that shit that might just change a reverend's life
Bitch I'm so fly that I can tell yo ass what heaven looks like
Lil bitch I'm Barry Bonds mixed with Farrakhan
Runnin' shit like a marathon
Flyin' with the bag like a carry-on
I'm a fuckin' don like I'm Perignon
And I'm Megatron with this ak, and my autobots stay ready
I'm a nightmare, no Freddy, you don't really want smoke like Reggie
Feel this from what I've been through, God's strong and influential
I'll shorten up your circuit, don't make me disassemble
Body is the temple, fire in the church
I will take life from you pussies like you was givin' birth
Now all eyes on me like the stovetop
I'm a sex machine and bitches wanna do the robot
Thinkin' they gon' get in real good but don't know the doors locked
That's when I turn them bitches around, just like a road block
I never been the jealous type, that shit weak like 7 nights
Designer and a pair of Mike's, you ain't fly like you scared of heights
Turnin' down deals left and right, I'm shinin' bright as heavens light
There might not be a second life, that's why I count my blessings twice
They'd rather shoot instead of fight, that's why I clench my weapon tight
I'm blowin' first, I'll shoot the crap out em just like a pair of dice
Y'all ain't hit no nothin' like pitchers that's throwin' hella strikes
And I pray to the same God you do, that's who gave the devil life
Thank God a nigga finally made it off of his block
Don't beef with me cause I'm too smart, bitch I'm the ultimate opp
Like janitors walk with the mop, you keep on talkin', get popped
Caution, I'm hot off with his top, inside that coffin you'll rot
Bang!
:
Started off movin' grams, doin' it for my fam
Been in a couple jams, had to rearrange some plans
But it made me who I am (Yeah it made me who I am)

God showed me the light through the cloud
The hate all around
But look what it took us
No daddy watchin' mama struggle too
Me hittin' them streets, had to hustle too
I'm feelin' like Meek, everything I use to be not what I was accustom to
And then came the beef, where we came with choppas Asserted like brothas do, they snitch in them streets
I promise 12 the only trouble we run into
Now we whippin' cases
So many thought we wouldn't make it
Even me sometimes I had to face it
We did it so quick like I was taken
But now I'm on my shit
All you hard readers can't get a cent
Aim so straight I can't miss
Be in my face, I don't know how to quit

Still had sister, never put me second place
Shit wasn't never sweet
Just so I could eat
Sometimes she went days when she never ate
Done seen so much struggle, I'm comin' with it
Not ashamed of my pain, motha fuck a critic
Our refrigerator had nothin' in it
Told myself "then I gotta go fuckin' get it"
I remember days it was cold nigga
Our thermostat was the stove nigga
Way before the rappin' I was poor nigga
I was who was sleepin' on the floor nigga
Niggas seen niggas changed money made em' do it
I know the struggle well, I'm no stranger to it
Middle finger to it
I could make it through it
If there is a heaven, I ain't racin' to it
Had to sit drugs up on my scale
Dependent on clientele
Done took way to many L's
Sat in counties with no bail
Doin' push-ups in my cell
Time passin' like a snail
Never told, I'll never tell
Held that water like a pail
Got up every time I fell
Niggas tried me they got nailed
Trigger happy like Pharrell
Nina singin' like Adele
Got away with murder twice, hope I don't get sent to hell
Thankful I ain't in no grave or up in somebody's jail
All my niggas trust my vision, told em' hold on like a rail
I ain't never led us wrong, like I don't know how to spell
I get paid for every thought, like a fuckin' wishin' well
This is Fire in The Church, coldest thing to drop since hail

Yeah cuz I’m that dude and when it come to these hoes I’m a fool
But this ain’t nothing new
We major and got hella flavor bitches want to taste us
Know they say life is what you make it and we makin’ paper
Fuck the law they will never take us haters lookin’ flagrant
Still we ball and stick to the script just like a narrator
Steppin’ flexin’ ain’t no way ‘round it
These haters hate but we won’t play ‘bout it naw
I keep that MAC my broski got the shotty
Ain’t nothing leave up out this bitch and catch a body


I hit the scene I be super clean these hoes break their necks
When I flex step through like Jerome tell hoes stop the press
Bitch I’m fresh everyday I'm flee Jordan on my feet
I’m a king but not like Lebron I stay with the heat
Yeah fly guys in this bitch you know we get shit crackin’
And we turnt up in this bitch everybody brought ratchets
Real niggas no actin’ even though we ‘bout action
Smooth criminal like Mike Jackson boy this shit is deeper than rappin’
Take no L’s give a fuck ‘bout 12 boy we aim for shit
Forty bang and this ain’t a game we don’t play that shit
Been gettin’ money since a youngin’ hustlin’ Rico, Ace, and Mitch
Take your bitch have her takin’ trips just to make you flip
And when we cruise girl you set the mood and you super smooth
Toss you bands baby count the loot double count it too
Give me brain take me straight to school like I had no clue
We get bueked shawty tuck the tool you know what to do


Ohh we breakin’ rules baby
I see you lookin’ I’m the one you want to choose baby real nigga no fugazy
Jordan on my shoes not tryna be rude
But I take ya from your boo then I show you what it do
I’m just in the club wit my niggas takin’ pictures with stacks and I ain’t worried ‘bout nothing shawty
All my niggas brought straps, all my niggas ball out, all my niggas got dough
And when I wit my niggas I swear everywhere that we go
Man, ever since I made it big now
And I be dressing like I'm rich now
Got hella bitches on my dick now
They wanna get dick'd down
They be with the shits now
They wanna be way  more then friends now
They say they wanna have my kids now
I swear they all up on my dick now
Hoping they get dick'd down
They be with the shits now

Was caught up in that street life
Hustling moving big loud
Had to kick out quick
Feel like the devil had me pinned down
Rap God I was sent down
Labels want to sit down
Mama got a big smile
My lyrics pay the rent now
I be setting trends now
Walk-throughs, I get 10 thou'
Remember window shopping
I got options when I spend now
Used to rock white tees
I got versace on my skin now
Bitches on my dick
They want to blow me like the wind now
I know them niggas pissed now
30 in my clip now
I swear I won't  miss, (pow)
Y'all families gon' miss y'all
Still got pistols hidden in every room inside my crib now
Knew I was gon' blow like a grenade, I pulled that pin out
All I do is win now
So I know what it is now
They figure since I'm poppin' I got money I can lend out
So that's that greed within y'all , Don't care if I offend y'all
Knowing y'all ain't real, but everyone wanna pretend now

Man ever since I made it big now
And I be dressing like I'm rich now
And hella bitches on my dick now
They wanna get dick'd down
They be with the shits now
They wanna be way more then friends now
They say they wanna have my kids now
I swear they all up on my dick now
Hoping they get dick'd down
They be with the shits now

Man, every time I drop some music
These bitches get shot by cupid
I'm not foolish, far from stupid
So miss me with all that fu shit
I can smell an opportunist
As strong as your perfume is
I see through the dark
I'm blessed with a light as bright as the moon is
Man as soon you start buzzing
Hoes crushing all of a sudden
Bunch of niggas showing love
With hopes they can fit in your budget
Out here acting like day ones
When they know that they really wasn't
But I'm out like a concussion
No question they ain't one hunnid'
Got deal with so much hate now
I gotta watch them snakes now
My struggles I embrace now
I'm too Godly to break down
Bitches think it's sweet
They wanna see how good it taste now
And even those who hate
Mention my name with all the greats now
I be getting dough now
Moncler when it's cold out
Giuseppe's  when he's stepping
Need a red carpet to roll out
Ain't have to sell my soul to be on top
And sell these shows out
I'm no fire truck but niggas know I bring the hose (hoes) out

And ever since I made it big now
And I be dressing like I'm rich now
And hella bitches on my dick now
They wanna get dick'd down
They be with the shits now
They wanna be way more then friends now
They say they wanna have my kids now
I swear they all up on my dick now
Hoping they get dick'd down
They be with the shits now
I thought you knew that I'm the man on me
Got all these bitches want dance on me
None of ‘em can’t wait to get their hands on me
And I’m so hard I got the opps turn into fans on me
Keep the tooly keep some bands on me
I’m never lackin’ I be damned on me
Brand new Glock that bitch won’t jam on me
And I’m so hard I got the opps turn into fans on me

From the bottom of the bottom is where I came from
Fought fire with fire nigga I had a flamer
I turn my hell into heaven yup I done came up
Had to kick disloyal subjects up out of my kingdom
Whether they hate me or not they still bring my name up
But I only rock with the ones who ain’t never change up
It’s kind of funny when haters start smellin’ money
Everybody want to hop all aboard like here the train come
Remember whippin’ through the town on me
A couple thou’ forty cal on me
I put food in mouths servin’ pounds on me
And niggas hate I graduated cap and gown on me
A bunch of jewelry bunch of tats on me
That ass was fat she threw it back on me
Her nigga mad cuz I got racks on me
But boy I come like overalls you know the straps on me


Forty on my hip again, thirty in my clip again
I feel like Diddy wit L.O.X. I’m about my Benjamin
Had to hustle in this concrete jungle we livin’ in
Been down before let the devil know I ain’t giving in
I put God first and he put me back on my shit again
These haters pissed again they throwing a fit again
But soon as I win again they back on my dick again
I’m making banks uncle Phil up in Vivian
No injury but lots of ice on me
Heard you wanna poke me like a knife on me
I hope you really bout that life on me
Cuz once I’m up you know I’m shootin’ like the dice on me
A bunch of haters wishing death on me
Don’t get a casket tryna flex on me
Cuz I’m a turn into to a ref on me
That tool eject up out this Tec that how he left on me
I get it crackin' like eggs I'm Yeshua back from the dead
I could turn any thought into bread
I'm no Christian but I got the Edge
It gets cold when I slide like a sled
When I do so no needle and thread
Bullets flippin' up better hit heads
Turn a coffin into your new bed
I'm hip hop's Stephen King of Westcraven
Gotta be on my paper no gradin'
Gotta bring 'em that message like ravens
Every struggle I went through was trainin'
Every loss there's a lesson I'm gainin'
Can't be scared to get wet when it's rainin'
We can't grow if we don't let the pain in
Don't make excuses and don't do no blamin'
Everyone thinks the truth's on the canvas
But only the creator could paint it
Bitch that means only God could explain it
Wanna meet him I'll make some arrangements
Niggas act like it's war that they cravin'
Until I come and do an invasion
If you real say that shit to my face
And not behind my back like an apron
When I see you don't do no explainin'
Make you eat every word you was sayin'
I just wanna see what you was thinkin'
So you already know how I'm aimin'
Point it at his head and then strike him down
Make his ass eat a light like he Raiden
Put a part in his top like it's braidin'
When that clip hit his top he ain't shavin'
I'm a boss, bitch I do what I choose to
Bitch I been turned like a loose screw
I don't sell drugs but I used to
I been the connect before bluetooth
I get top from your boo in a new coupe
I could rap I look good I could shoot too
I draw when it's sketchy plus my shooters ready
To pull that bitch out like a loose tooth
They gone edit don't care about who's who
Tell your kids they gon' cry when they lose you
Put they pa on the TV like Blue's Clues
Murder scene when we shootin', no news crew
Bunch of blood on his shirt that ain't prune juice
I just made his designer say suwoop
Now he need a casket and new suit
Wet him up in the morning like Fruit Loops
I got God up inside of me
Go tell the devil that I am the hottest commodity
Loyal to the Lord without a havin' a thought of a heaven
He didn't have to promise me
In my country my president's prejudice
Them devils do not believe in equality
Never compromisin' with poverty
Don't play games with your money, Monopoly
Get a check and invest in some property
Always leave with that steel like a robbery
Fuck everyone's feelings don't do sugarcoatin'
It ain't no substitute for honesty
Ever wonder if Jesus is scared
Or he got the balls to pop up like the lottery
And if God's so forgiving
Then would he be willing to accept the devil's apology
I know I'm a blessing I don't come in second
My flow is from heaven, my soul is protected
This rapper's gifted and what I'ma give to you is out of the box
Like you opening presents
Me and hip hop like Hulk Hogan and wrestling
Can't hustle too long, gotta know when to exit
Started off trappin' and turned it to rappin'
It's FGE, we the new No Limit Records
Got dough with my bros off the dope I was sellin'
Had hoes gettin' naked, got throat like a necklace
Some homies got jealous didn't know I was destined
Only Lord knows, with that pole I was reckless
We stopped what I'm doin' like hold up a second
No PlayStation game, I was loading that tech in
My opps caught them bullets with no interception
I shot the crap out 'em like rolling a seven
I got the key to the door
Remember when I used to sleep on the floor
No eskimo but I pack heat in my coat
It ain't no better feeling than bein' awoke
Acknowledging God is the reason I'm dope
Make 'em fiend for the flow that make demons get ghost
He ain't on my level so pray for the devil
For he is the sinner that needs it the most
Yeah
Cypher 7, you niggas know the fuckin' routine
Mob
Coming up I had it rough, yup every night I used to pray
I was tryna do it big, all a nigga had was faith
My bro in the cage, fightin' for us like no MMA
Free the real, when they come home it's a holiday
No it ain't no MILF, when this fuckin' .40 pop a pussy
I ain't drinking on no milk, but I smoke a lotta cookies
I just came in the game, ballin' on 'em like a rookie
Shorty see me shining, she blew on me like I fuck with Tookey
Money, drugs, and murder, I come from Peoria nigga
And I'm not Sean Livingston but I'm a warrior nigga
She thick and she bad as fuck, give me neck like I'm Dracula
Come through with this .50 spittin' it's gon' be a massacre
Clapping at you like a graduation once I cap 'em up
Smoke a nigga like a session I ain't even pass the blunt
Shooting at you like directors since you niggas acting tough
Now it's ambulances backing up with bags to pack you up
Ain't no question how I'm rocking we the fucking trending topic
If it's beef, CP3, how I'm shooting with the rockets
FGE, taking off, while you haters sitting watching
Hit his teeth, with the iron like I'm golfing, get a coffin bitch

FGE shit man, ha
'Tigue in this bitch
I been grinding, feel like Weezy, I got money on my mind
You know that I play to win, like it's money on the line
I'm not taking disrespect, all this shit gon' get correct
Know some niggas cut like chess get X'd and boxed you look connect
Watch me ball just like a scout, on anyone who gon' doubt
I know I'm gon' make it out, I make all my haters pout
Some of my niggas move pillows like they tryna fix the couch
Soon as they get that shit in, you know they gon' get it out
Tried to tell 'em we don't play, that's what's tried and they failed
Watch these niggas, they not real, they not built for this, they frail
Bring that bullshit, and we sprayin' tryna clear the smell
Y'all be the ones 12 that's singing like 112
Smart and cute with a nice body, not ball hogging couldn't pass it
She was wanted just like Angela Jolie I gotta have it
Used to fuck her lost connection now shit lagging guess shit happen
Beat that pussy up, we go pound for pound we not dapping, uh
Every beat I touch, I murder, I know the feelin
Fans know when I'm on beast, like O'Neal I shall kill
No sirens got a clear path headed to the top
Pussy nigga might foul but he know that free shot
Ball in this bitch no blender bottle
Gotta thick bitch gon' bend then swallow
I told bro we can't give up, I don't quit just like Apollo
Creed, I know I ain't perfect I'm a sinner like MB but
I still pray everyday, and not just for me

Yeah, Talley
FGE shit
Look, aye, going down they throat again
If they hate watch 'em swallow it hard
I'm gifted as a holiday card
These niggas sweeter than holiday heart
Bitch I been the truth, and gon' be either when I meet God
I don't speak watch the bodies I crop
But don't get put in that closet it's dark
So much shit follow my heart, had the heart in it
That's spending they worth won't get caught in it
I need everything blessed when I'm crossing it
So I searched for God's power and harnessed it
Faith boosting me up like a starter kit
Said your word was the sword so I sharpened it
Now my verse is so worth you could auction it
I collect with a blame, but literally
And fuck shit ain't safe if it's near to me
I'm down to die for who's dear to me
Hard for me to cry but it's tears in me
Theres no fear in me, for every fuck nigga hearing me
I drive with that steel like I'm Harry B
And I pop it like a pill in me
So full of rage, I cage it
Only God knows how amazing
Don't be a John Doe I'ma blaze him
He in church only Jesus could save him
I guess it's with the beat when I take him
Wanna play it ain't free I'm a gamer
Like 2K no 2 3 when I fade him
Put that lead in his sheets and erase him
Now back to that paper, aye
Like schooling nigga, and I been on my A game
I don't know where you been nigga
I go hard as the freight train, I get shit moving nigga
Don't think like I slang 'cain
How your bitch tryna move in nigga
And I stay fly as a crane, high as Mariah could sing
And I like my dollars the same
So you know I'ma grind to the grave
Go axe if I slide, if I bang
Bet my city won't lie on my name
Even though they know how I behave
They don't know we got bodies for days
Rahhh!

Pray For The Devil right on schedule they can't get me off his heels
Rap God bitch and yes I get paid for the flow no water bill
My shit been ill as coughing, still I'm on the road not off a pill
Don't even start I'll squeeze and spark Steven Seagal I'm hard to kill
I'm known to blow you all to chill get turned to fire Marshall Bill
Then you'll know what I talk was real, and how inside a coffin feel
And niggas know how I'm shooting, you don't want smoke like I'm Reggie
Let's keep it G, you don't want beef, you don't want me like a deli
I hope you ready when I slide up on your ass like a wedgie
Come out the cut no machete, this bitch gon' blow like it's Becky
I'm godly with the bars, like the lord was my celly
I'm 'bout my cake Little Debbie, these rappers know they ain't ready
They just my sons and right now I'm babying 'em like a belly
They say Montana got this bitch on lock but I ain't R. Kelly
Im cooler than Uncle Jessie, known to snap Fonzarelli
You see the drip like I'm sweaty, you wanna jacket no Pelle
I made it happen with music, pour some strings like a cello
If you want war then I'm gon' draw like Triple G and Canelo
I'm bringing heat like a kettle, yo ass is grass like a metal
You know my metal to put niggas in the dirt like a shovel
I'll take you there like a shuttle, and take your soul like a pedal
Came out the hood not the ghetto and he thought he seen the Devil
I shot him in both of his thighs and the knee like Carmelo
I had him shaking like Jell-o then took his top off, LaMelo
Squa!
