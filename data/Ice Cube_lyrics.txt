Damn!
( Forgot to do somethin', let me see...uh)
Oh, yeah—it ain’t over, motherfuckers
"The motherfuckin' saga continues"
"Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well get the fuck up!"
"A bitch is a bitch. So if you're poor—"
“It was once said by a man who couldn’t quit, dope—”
“Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say”
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
"Here's what they think about you"
"That punk Ice Cube—"
"Here's what they think about you"
"Cube was suckin' so much New York dick"
"Here's what they think about you"
"Real Niggaz? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace"
"Here's what they think about you"
"Why y'all let his punk ass in the group"
"Here's what they think about you"
"When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube"
"Here's what they think about you"
"When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back"
"I smell..."
"Here's what they think about you"
"N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube!"
"Here's what they think about you"
"Cube was suckin' so much New York dick"
"Here's what they think about you"
"Real Niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace"
"Here's what they think about you"
"That punk Ice Cube—"
"Here's what they think about you"
"Why y'all let his punk ass in the group"
"Here's what they think about you"
"All I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back"
"Here's what they think about you"
"N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube!"
Fuck all y'all!

Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight Bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my Mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ay yo Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you bent-a-dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most?
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
Cause you know I'm the one that flowed
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no vaseline

Now you're getting done without vaseline
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Naw, cut them balls
Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a mothafucking Ready Teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
Cause he's going out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
Cause I remember when you drove a B-210
Broke as a mothafucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the First Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no vaseline

Now you're getting done, get-getting done
Now you're getting done, get-getting done
Now you're getting done without va-va-va-va-vaseline

I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E a'be hanging from a tree
With no vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking bout?!
Get rid of that Devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk, too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Eric Wright, punk, always into something
Gettin' fucked at night
By Mista Shitpacker
Bend over for the goddamn cracker
No vaseline
Mothafuckin' nosejob having ass
Mothafucking Jheri Curl lite
Ambi wearing mothafuckin' bitch
Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', "Will I live another 24?"
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
"Which park are y'all playin' basketball?"
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
‘Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': "Domino!"
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day

Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp"
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Half way home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day

Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?
- Prior to gangsta rap music, the world was a peaceful place. And then all of that changed: violence, rape, murder, arson, theft, war. These are all things that came about as a result of gangsta rap music
- But wasn't Compton dangerous before gangsta rap ?
- Wrong! Compton was a nature preserve for bunny rabbits. When gangsta rap came along, they tore down the country clubs and put up housing projects!
(Maestro!!!) Blame me!
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

You lookin' at the grand wizard
Warlord, vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up, pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothin' like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothin' like a man that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga, I'm hot as Phoenix, Arizona
I'm Utah: I got multiple bitches
It's a new law, keep a hold of your riches
Dumb nigga, don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant

I can say what I want to say
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle, just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva, and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this, ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta, and why should I change that?
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin' to change rap
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back?
I'm tryin' to get me a Maybach
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me "don't say that"?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

So if I act like a pimp
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy-headed ho
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin' about real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain, not your back
Use your brain, not a gat; it's a party, not a jack
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal
And don't be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial
Look at my life, Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
‘Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't gotta be fake, ‘cause he is my homie

If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow-flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

Oh yeah, and another thing
For all y'all niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talkin' about gangsta rap
‘Cause 9 times out of 10
You don't know the fuck you talkin' about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do

Yeah, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, come on

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a goddamn thang changed
It’s the same old same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day-to-day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower-livin'?
The projects, thank God for Russell Simmons
Thank God for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggas taken over showbiz

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

It's boys in the hood, it's toys in the hood
Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood
‘Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a Crip and a Blood in the hood
‘Cause when niggas get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by Five-O
Grandmama came to court with her Bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A, State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the 4-4 up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming, but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' them up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Aye, y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
‘Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, stop trippin on it
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga
That's why I'm sick of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine-double-M
The day is coming that you'll all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down—it's all about coming up
So what they do? Go and ban the AK
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away, run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham
When I'm shooting, let's see who drop
The police, the media, and suckers that went pop
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put 'em overseas they be begging to come back
And say we promote gangs and drugs
You wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen than in college?
Because of that line I might be your cellmate
That's from the nigga ya love to hate

(Fuck you Ice Cube!)
Yeah, haha! It’s the nigga you love to hate
(Fuck you Ice Cube!)
(Ay yo baby, your mother warned you about me)
It's the nigga you love to hate
(Yo, you ain’t doin' nothin' positive! Yo, you ain’t doin' nothin positive for the brothers, what you gotta say for yourself?)
(You don't like how I'm living? Well, fuck you)

Once again it's on, the motherfucking psycho
Ice Cube the bitch-killer, cap-peeler
Yo, running through the line like Bo, there's no pot to piss in
I put my fist in
Now, who do ya love to hate?
Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball 'cause I don't fake
You're begging I fall off
The crossover, might as well cut them balls off
And get your ass ready for the Lenching
The Mob is dropping common sense and
We'll gank in the pen, we'll shank
Any Tom, Dick and Hank, and get the ass
Spanked -- it ain't about how right or wrong you live
But how long you live
I ain't with the bullshit
I meet mo' bitches, mo' hoes
Don't wanna sleep so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And if you're locked up I dedicate my stylin'
From San Quentin to Rikers Island
We got 'em afraid of the funky shit
I like to clown so pump up the sound
In your Jeep, make the old ladies say
"Oh my god—break, it's the nigga ya love to hate"

(Fuck you Ice Cube)
Yeah come on fool it’s the nigga you love to hate
(Fuck you Ice Cube)
Yeah what up punk it’s the nigga you love to hate
A bitch is a...ohhhh

Soul Train done lost they soul
Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others damn
It almost look like the Bandstand
You ask me: "did I like Arsenio?"
About as much as the Bicentennial
I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools
'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube
And what I say, what I portray and all that
And ain't even seen the gat
I don't wanna see no dancing
I'm sick of that shit -- listen to the hit
'Cause yo if I look and see another brother
On the video trying to out-dance each other
I'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle
And don't give me that shit about role model
It ain't wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each
'Cause laws are made to be broken up
What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up
And build mold and fold theyself into shape
Of the nigga you love to hate
Yeah, yeah
Fool, you know how we do it
Westside
Comin' from the Westside
Nothin' but the Westside

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on the tee-ta-lee, you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My troupe can, ill—fool, I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

Comin' from the Westside
Comin' from the Westside
Westside, comin' from the Westside

Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Who got got and who got shot
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob, Planet of the Apes
I'm down with Eiht and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want "The Bomb," just like George Clinton
S-K-D is down to catch a body
Put on Knee Deep, we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

You know how we do it

Jack be nimble, and Jack be quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick
'Cause I'm that fool from South Central
You'll think you stuck yourself with a number two pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With "Mo' Bounce to the Ounce" in the dash
Mash up, Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great, slow down for the dip
On 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive, to keep the fo' from crashin'
Stashin' a Glock and I thought you knew it
You know how we do it

Comin' from the Westside, Westside
Nothin' but the Westside
It's hittin' on the Westside
Fool, you know how we do it
Everybody wants to go to Heaven

But take my advice or I'll take your life
Now if you still wanna slice, let's start with the fingers
Let's move to the toes, and end with the penis
See men are from Mars, now you from Venus
How dumb you got to be tryin' to think with the genius
It's the big payback, you can't clown James Brown
See a brother been down ever since Jamestown
You either swim or you're drowned, you either gagged or you're bound
Now you can't make a sound, boy look at you now

Everybody wants to go to Heaven

The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case
Racist motherfucker

Didn't your momma, tell you not to talk to strangers
Lil' nigga, I'm the Hillside Strangler

Most rappers, they wanna fuck sangers
I'm a nigga, that wanna own Topanga
G4, pull it up out the hanger

The swine, I'm your face rearranger
In a mansion cause Jesus born in a manger
Motherfucker, belong on Jerry Spranger
I'm a gangsta, up in your CD changer
I'll gank ya, for 20 bucks then I'll thank ya
Police, still get the middle fanger


Lil' niggas, don't try this at home
Momma in the bathroom leave her ass alone
Cause she probably taking chronic straight to the dome
Go play you lil' fucker, stop being grown
Dave Chappelle, 50 million and a throne
With a big Zulu bitch, nigga getting blown
Watch your tone, if your wear Coppertone
Go back to Africa used to be a theme song
I'm in the zone, do anybody got a Zong?
I ain't your poppa, but daddy is a rolling stone
Youse a clone, who don't know the shit you on
Unless it's on, a motherfucking ringtone
I'm in a room with two bottles of Patron
You need a loan, to fuck with the Family Stone
Nigga go on, tell 'em Ice Cube is home
Gorilla niggas, here come King Kong


Ice Cube motherfucka
West Coast motherfucka
Smoke some weed
(Hey)
Hey Chop
(Hey)
These haters tried to blow me up, man
(Who is this)
The Don Mega, nigga, who you think
(Ey, homie, what happened)
My whole life flashed before my eyes, man

Life...
Niggas used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack
Talking shit cause I'm down for my set
I'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette
Who these niggas think they are
Wishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar
I start busting and they scatter like water bugs
Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
Cause sometimes I feel like a nut
Don’t give a fuck when I open you up
Hot rocks
Fly from the back seat
And busta-ass niggas run like a track meet
And if you caught in the middle
Bleed more than a little (what)
Killer King is the hospital
Feeling numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit
Black mothers have fits
I don’t give a shit

Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
It's raining bullets and I'm still there
I'm still there

My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning taking out the trash
Feeling like a loser, alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the peddles, the other on the handle bars
Tryna be ghetto stars
They said, "are you from the Westside is it so?"
I said, "hell yeah and who want to know?"
Me
In slow mo’, .44 slugs, face down in the mud
Puddle full of blood
Left for dead, the pain starts to spread
Now I can’t feel my legs
I meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center
As I enter I.C.U
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can’t move my legs, he said don’t try to
Now this ain’t the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
But my dick don’t work it don’t even hurt
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube
A'be pissing through a tube
Fool I'm a vet

Fool, I'm a vet you can bet
I can dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
It’s raining bullets and I'm still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair

Fuck a V-A they need G-A
Gang Hospital for a cripple
Now I'm drinking Ripple
Same corner, same hood I'm still there
With bandanas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hood rat hoes I'm fired
They mad cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody want to put they dope on me
Sayin I won't get searched by the LAPD
I'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five
Depending on that to keep my ass alive
I don’t got bows but my arm's about a one-six
With fucking legs looking like tooth picks
Some times I can’t deal
Got to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch
Now I'm on the torch
Smoking cocaine
Just to maintain
Nothing to gain nothing to lose
And last night I couldn’t make it to the bathroom
Feeling like a 2-year-old
You can’t get a sip from the brew I hold
It’s the only friend to a stranger
AKA: handicapped gangbanger
There's a lot in my life I regret becoming a ghetto vet
Fool I'm a Vet

Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
It's raining bullets and I'm still there
I'm still there
Dedicated to all the ghetto vets
For every nigga that done took one for the hood
God damn!
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
And when dealin' wit' Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin' is not just the name of this jam, but a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers as known to break em' off something
Give it to me
 (x4)
"There goes the neighborhood"
"There goes the neighborhood"
"There goes the neighborhood"
"There goes the neighborhood"

Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent, front and back glass got tint
Tryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools can't hold us
Every chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers
Comin' up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin' bean pies
Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
With "U Can't Touch This" on the front
I'm 'bout to get rich
Cause life ain't nuttin but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama hoes
So after the screwin'
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
I'm out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch, cause I'm steady mobbin'

("Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?") (Steady mobbin')
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
(Steady mobbin')

Bustin' caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
Cause I'm gettin' major
Fuck Pactel, move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends:
Don't drink 8 Ball, cause St. Ide's is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin in the street
Niggas get mad, tempers are flarin'
Cause they got a few bitches starin'
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches, make for happy Feds
I make it my duty to cuss 'em
Out, cause I just don't trust em
And if you tell on me I'm bombin' on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
(Steady mobbin')
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

Since one-time so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
'Cause I'm rollin' on rims
Eating soul food, neckbones from M&M's
Grubbin' like a motherfucker
Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bailin'
When I hit a left on Ruthelen, "Whattup loc?"
Don't you know that niggas get smoked
They take they life for a joke, get in nigga
I'll take you to the pad soon
Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my low rider
Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps
But hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin' music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch
Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Give me the nappy and make me happy
The ho said 'Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?'
I said yeah, but I don't play sex
Without puttin' on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night, no longer steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
(Steady mobbin')
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
(Steady mobbin')
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Ice Cube with Da Lench Mob, I got it goin' on
A nigga that's livin' in the city of the criminal zone
One-time can't keep the law in order
'Cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area
The way I'm talkin' I'm scarin' ya
I'm darin' ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
'Cause if you is or you ain't a gangbanger
Keep one in the chamber
'Cause you'll get them thangs put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin' did my head grow?
Will the boys 'n the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay
I keep my 9 anyway
For the day one of my homies wanna squab
I'm still rollin' wit Da Lench Mob

(AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted)

Back in the day I did my share of dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
To bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I repo your Vette, then jet
Back to the criminal set
I leave clue after clue but they can't catch me yet
'Cause I'm slick as slippery
They can't get wit me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad, mad cos I'm the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted

Aiyo, here's what the poster read:
'Ice Cube is wanted dead'
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and si-reens
When I fiend, first they yo' rings, now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
It's the American way
'CauseI'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Ice Cube - a motherfuckin' klepto
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap
You know I'ma beat the wack
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
So get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight
'Cause I'm scarin ya, wanted by America

(Aiyo Cube man, they on your ass)

Word, but who the fuck is Herb?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let 'em see a nigga invasion
Point blank on a Caucasian
Cocked the hammer didn't crack no smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin' in the den, yo it couldn't be
(Whattup G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Packed my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
Cos the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin' my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbing the white folks
Now I'm in the pen with the soap-on-a-rope
I said it before and I'll still taught it
Every motherfucker with a color is most wanted

AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, uh,  reports that Ice Cube is the leader of the, uh, Lench Mob. Uh, also in the group they have J-Dee, Chill, T-Bone, Yo-Yo, Del, K-Dee. Sounds like a black thing
I think they spotted me

They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
This is Bigfoot, don't get it shook
Out in Japan they call me Godzilla
Up in Africa, King Kong gorilla

Michael Joe Jackson used to call me Thriller
All my enemies swear I'm Attila
Vietnam vet, burn down your villa
Captain Crunch scream, serial killer
Out in O-Town I'm a fucking pirate
Think I'm Rodney King? We can start a riot
To a fat bitch, I'm a fucking diet
You in solitary, I'm piece and quiet
This a nightmare on Elm Street
You're just a runaway, where the pimps be
You'se a thirsty man, I'm so empty
At your funeral, no sympathy


They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
Please check the time, I'm like turpentine
And it's burping time, you exhausted I know
Cause I'm overtime and I'm over the line
Come over to mine, I already left
You wanting a rhyme, bitch? I'm So So Def
You ready to shine, I'm already blind, you already lyin'
A nigga ain't buyin' what you selling, always open; 7/11
When I blow niggas know here come tsunami
You got a bucket list, my list
You that drowning kid at the pool party
I'm the carnivore over your body


Don't make me, don't make me put this foot up your ass
(Don't do it)
Don't make me, don't make me put this foot up your ass
(Don't)
Don't make me, don't make me put this foot up your ass
What you do? Bring it down and bring me my cash

You'se a fucking prick, but I'm Moby Dick
I'm Darth Vader, you Obi Wan Kenobi, bitch
He's Jim Kelly, y'all, I'm Terry Bradshaw
He is baby ass, I'm like diaper rash
I'm like stinking trash, I'm like party crash
Like getting caught with hash
I'm like your stolen cash
I like you feeling bad, they call me Schleprock
I like the whole country looking at the debt clock
Pyroclastic flow, this is Pompeii
Whoever in the way, turn you into clay
Call me out my name and that's a hurricane
I'll send the wind and the water and the pouring rain
I am boring, mane, I am snoring, mane
I'm the pain that's wearing off the Novacane
I'm the weight you gained, I make your titties hang
I'm the crowded train that just hit the mane
"Twenty D Energizers."
"Twenty C Energizer?"
"D, not C, D."
"C Energizer?"
"D, motherfucker, D! Learn to speak English first, alright? D!"
"How many you say?"
"Twenty, motherfucker, twenty."
"Honey..."
"Mother fuck you!"

Every time I wanna go get a fuckin' brew
I gotta go down to the store with the two
Oriental one penny countin' motherfuckers
That make a nigga mad enough to cause a little ruckus
Thinkin' every brother in the world's out to take
So they watch every damn move that I make
They hope I don't pull out a gat and try to rob
They funky little store, but, bitch, I got a job
"Look, you little Chinese motherfucker
I ain't tryin' to steal none of yo' shit, leave me alone!"
"Mother fuck you!"
Yo, yo, check it out
So don't follow me up and down your market
Or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
Of the nationwide boycott
Juice with the people, that's what the boy got
So pay respect to the black fist
Or we'll burn your store right down to a crisp
And then we'll see ya
Cause you can't turn the ghetto into black Korea
"Mother fuck you!"
(Big Bird: Sesame Street)
Say look at this! I've been cleaning out my nest, and I found an old book of my poetry!
(Ice Cube)
Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job cuz I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid by rappin' to the nation
But that's not likely, so here's my application
Pass it to the man at AT&T
Cause when I was in school I got the A.E.E
But there's no SC for this youngsta
I didn't have no money, so now I got to punch the
Clock, gotta slave, and be half a man
But whitey says there's no room for the African
Always knew that I would clock G's
But welcome to McDonalds; "may I take your order, please?"
Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
Cause my son doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes, that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and similac?
Do I have to sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from Bush?
Or Jesse Jackson, and Operation PUSH?
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A Massengill
What the hell
Crack will sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss Parker, little Joe, and Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I copped me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po', to a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I never get love again
But blacks are too fuckin' broke to be Republican
Now I remember, I used to be cool
Till I stopped fillin' out my W-2
Now senators are gettin' high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is our only room to walk
Cause we don't want a drug push
But a bird in the hand, is worth more than a Bush
Tell the politicians, the hustlers: live and let live (yeah)

Everythangs corrupt, everythangs fucked up
Everythangs by the bout' to buck me shit out of luck
Verse 1:
Go to school, the teacher wanna fuck the students
Go to church, my preacher turned to prostitution
The prosecution never read my files
That evil ass judge fell asleep at my trial
This shit is wild, chickens get as sick as the cows
Birds fallin out the sky, fish dyin' in piles
Its fishy, politicians smell like my bowels
Talkin' that shit, really crampin' my styles
I got many, now I'm pinchin' pennies no doubt
I sqeezed Lincoln so hard, a fuckin' booger came out
Its a shame, I used to be on top of my game
They took the shirt off my back and replaced it with chains
I met Mr. Lee Harvey, from the tea party
He used to hate Obama til' he felt hurricane Charley
Looking for his FEMA check, it's gone with the wind
When em' dicks is in, you know the fix is in
(Hook: x2)
For my birthday, buy me a politician
It's a shame that you got to dish yo' children
Everythangs corrupt, everythangs fucked up
Everythangs by the bout' to buck me shit out of luck
Verse 2:
Everythang's a scam, beat the next man
That's capitalism, they'll just build a new prison
For you slick ass niggas' that's tryin' to beat the system
Put you on the front line if you ain't re-enlisting
It's hot in hell's kitchen, get ready for the lynching
Brain-wash media, and puppet politician
Keep you out of position, out of commission
By medicine or food, that's not a decision
The 99 percent, is man tryin' to vent
Police grab my fuckin' arm, then they got bent
Now it's in a splint, I can't pay my rent
The interest on my credit card I ain't made a dent
The U.S mint, I heard they bout' to print
But it's fucked up cause' I won't see a cent
I'm sick of gettin' ignored, this wall I can't afford
I'm going to the pent, free room, free ward
(Hook x2)
Outro:
It's wall of confusion, my niggas' they losin'

Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood
Like everybody from the hood is up to no good
You think all the girls around here are trickin
Up there lookin like Superchicken
At night I see your light through my bedroom window
But I ain't got shit but the pad and pencil
I can't wait till I hear you say
"I'm going down, mayday, mayday." I'm gonna clown
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me
Y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi
Military force, but we don't want ya
Standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher
"So fly like an eagle."
But don't follow us wherever we go
The shit that I'm saying, make sure it's heard
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird

"Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird" 

Now, my homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex
And let me try the fo' next
Now the fo' I was driving was hotter than july
Looked up and didn't see a ribbon in the sky
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom
"Calling all cars, I think we've got em."
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood
I think I drove through every single hood
South Central, Compton and Watts
Long Beach, bust a U, here come the cops
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes
Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious
You know that I'm running
Shit, I hear it humming
Fuck, I see it coming
Is it a bird? Yup
Is it a plane? No
I hit me a right on El Segundo
Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala
Let's see if they would folla
Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another
Met me a baby pitbull and his mother
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window
I wish it was my kinfolk
Had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third
Cuz I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird
"Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back
On. Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115
Miles an hour, with the police chasing him. Ehm, they're not gonna be
Real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh
Ehrr, they hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse."

Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't wanna see him
Could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?
See, I didn't want to gank you
But don't make me bank you, thank you
Tried to get yo the hood, and you might guess
That a fool like me done shot Cyrus
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle
Saying, "Fuck, where did he go?"
I bust me a left on Ruthelen. Park
The 735 and I'm bailin
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman
Looked out the window by the black bed
I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face
I close the blinds cause I didn't wanna catch a case
All that night, I heard the bird circle
While I was eating fish and watching Urkel
She said I could sleep on the couch
By two A.M. I was digging her out
Fuck the ghetto bird
"Which way is he going now?"
"Ok, now..now he's..he's actually southbound..on a service street
And, uh...Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure
Out which service srteet he suddelny turned off on. Uh, the sherriffs
Are..are...well I know that...Sherriffs ground units got thrown off"
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird
That's that gangsta shit
Check the original, y'all niggas digital

Motherfuckas love me
Young ass niggas they wanna thug for me
Wish I was the Godfather, sell drugs for me
But all they can do is tap cuz for me
Look homie, you can be my cronie
If you figure how to get a check out of Sony
Oh Lord, thought I was preaching to the choir
When I'm in this pulpit I might catch some fire
Glass full of gas, do you got a lighter?
Hand full of ass, why should I retire
The shit I spit might inspire the messiah
To throw these lives in a lake full of fire
Ain't nothing flier than my fuckin' rims and my tires
And a word to the wise, you better fuckin' recognize
That I been on the block since bitches did the wop
Since Floyd and Damien kept rocks in they socks, nigga
Taught 2Pac how to keep it gangsta
I showed Biggie Smalls how to release his anger
Who came before me? Melle Mel, Ice T
King T, KRS and the homie Chuck D
P.E, DMC, nigga know your history
If Cube ain't top 3, then you's a bitch to me
Ice Cube, the name will live in infamy
Ask the young nigga that invented Eazy-E

West Coast bitch, yeah that's all me
With Too Short and the D-R-E
We made it too hard, check our family tree
See you try to make a Snapple out of all them bad apples
Nigga no
Leave you baffled and gaffled
And running through your house like it's a motherfuckin' raffle
I'm a asshole with Tabasco, you the last ho I would ask for
If I had to leave Morehouse and walk into a ho house
The drink that I pour out, the weed that I blow out
It's all for my nigga Big Hurt, when I show out
Picture this in a frame, get torn out
When I wanna go out, red carpets get rolled out

Drop drop it, lemme see you squat it
Type a nigga gettin' private dances in the public
Hit her from the back, grabbing on her shoulders
Hair weave killa, girl don't you get nervous
Cleaning some detergent, all my cars got curtains
I left her like Ginobili
My Rollie cost a car, and I don't have a car note
I took her from the bar to the car to the condo

Drop girl drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
(If I hit the switch, I could make that ass) Drop

Brought to you by Drop it like its hot and pick it up like’s not production

(If I hit the switch, I could make that ass) Drop

This is the final boarding call for flight 1259 departing from Los Angeles. Final destination to St. Louis. Thank you

Damn G, the spot's gettin hot
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?
Police looking at niggas through a microscope
In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope
They trying to stop it
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?
Catch a flight to St. Louis
That's cool, cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers
Rented a car at wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty
Cause where we stayin, niggas look shady
But they can't fade South Central
Cause bustin a cap is fundamental
Checkin out every block close
Seein which one will clock the most
Yeah this is the one no doubt
Bust a U, Bone, and let's clear these niggas out
Ay ay man, whassup nigga?
Yo, well this Lench Mob nigga!
*gun shots*

Now clearin em out meant casualties
Still had the L.A. mentality
Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry
Wouldn't you know, a driveby in Missouri
Them fools got popped
Took their corner next day, set up shop
And it's better than slangin in the Valley
Triple the profit makin more than I did in Cali
Breakin off rocks like Barney Rubble
Cause them mark-ass niggas don't want trouble
And we ain't on edge when we do work
Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
Getting bitches and they can't stand a
Nineteen-ninety-one Tony Montana
Now the shit's like a war
Of gang violence, where it was never seen before
Punks run when the gat bust
Four Jheri curl niggas kickin up dust
And some of them are even lookin up to us
Wearing our colors and talkin that gang fuss
Giving up much love
Dyin for a street, that they never heard of
But other motherfuckers want to stand strong
So you know the phrase, once again it's on

Top of the news tonight, gangs from South Central, Los Angeles which are known for their drive-by shootings have migrated into East St. Louis, leaving three dead and two others injured. No arrests have been made. Police say this is a nationwide trend, with similar incidents occurring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma
("If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere!")

(BOOM) My homie got shot he's a goner, black
St. Louis niggas want they corner back
Shooting in snowy weather
It's illegal business, niggas still can't stick together
Fuckin police got the 4-1-1
That L.A. ain't all, surf and sun
But we ain't thinkin, bout the boys
Feudin, like the Hatfields and McCoys
Now the shit's gettin tricky
Cause now they lookin for the colors and the Dickies
Damn, the spot's gettin hot from the battle
About to pack up and start slangin in Seattle
But the NARCs, raid about six in the morning
Try to catch a nigga when he's yawnin
Put his Glock to my chest as I pause
Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers
Tryin to give me, fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender ain't givin a fuck
The fool must be sparkin
Talkin about a double life plea bargain
You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand, G
Plus the Black Guerilla family
And the white pride don't like no side
And it's a riot if anyone of us die
No parole or probation
Now this is a young man's summer vacation
No chance for rehabilitation
Cause look at the motherfuckin years that I'm facin
I'mma end it like this cause you know what's up
My life is fucked
:
Police, eat a dick straight up
(Look here you goddamn nigga, you're not gafflin nobody
You fuckin' understand me? 
That's right, get down on the goddamn ground NOWWWW! Fuckin move, NOWWW! )
(We're gonna do you like "King")
What goddamn "King"?
(Rodney King, Martin Luther King,  and all the goddamn Kings from Africa.)
Man 2: Look out, motherfucker
(gunshots followed by thuds and unresponsive police radio)
 Yeah
 Umm, uhh is Cheryl here?
 Well who are you?
 Tell her Ice Cube is here
 WHO?!
 Ice Cube!
 ICE CUBE?! Man I ain't lettin my damn daughter go out with no damn Ice Cubes man! Man what the hell you talkin' about man? I brought my daughter up man in a Catholic school, private school. Man what you want with her? I'm sick of this bullshit!
 Yo man, let me tell you somethin':

Your daughter was a nice girl, now she is a slut
A queen treatin' niggas just like King Tut
Gobblin up nuts, sorta like a hummingbird
Suckin up the Lench Mob crew, and I'm comin' third
Used to get straight A's, now she just skippin' class
Oh my, do I like to grip the hips and ass
Only seventeen, with a lot of practice
On black boys jimmies and white boys cactus
Sorry sorry sir, but I gotta be brief
A lotta niggas like bustin' nuts in her teeth
Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic
That don't mean shit, cause she's givin' up the ass quick
Quicker than you can say, "Candy,"
The bitch is on my Snicker... and oh man she
Can take on three men - built like He-Men
Her little-bitty twat got gallons of semen
Fourteen niggas in line ready to bang your
Pride-and-joy, I mean daddy's little angel
Tell the little bitch to bring her ass out the house
Cause your daughter's known, for givin' up the nappy dug out

"I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang
I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!"
 Givin up the nappy dug out!


Look motherfucker you better get from in front of my house with that old god damn bullshit, you curly-haired motherfucker. You better get out of here witcho' fine ass. Man, youse a little fine motherfucker

Mister, mister, before you make me go
I'm here to let you know your little girl is a ho
Nympho, nympho, boy is she bad
Get her all alone and out comes the kneepads
I know she is a minor and it is illegal
But the bitch is worse than Vanessa Del Rio
And if you decide to call rape
We got the little hooker on tape, now:
Tell the fuckin' slut to please hurry up
And wear that dress that's tight on her butt
So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed
Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead
Face turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles
Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes
You should hear how she sounds with a cock in her
Boots get knocked, from here to Czechoslovakia
Two are on top, one on the bottom
First nigga got the boots; man, you shoulda shot him
Cause after I got 'em it was over
Now niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover
On daddy's little girl
She keeps nuts in her mouth like the bitch was a squirrel
So tell Cheryl to bring her ass home
Cause the line at my house is gettin loooooooong, ay!

"I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang
I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!"
 Yeah.. yeah.. bitch, bitch givin up the nappy dug out!
"I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang
I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!"
 Yo..

Little motherfucker!
Daddy, where did he go?
I'll tell you where he went, god damnit!
Mercy!
"Givin up the nappy, givin up the nappy dug out" 
"Givin up the nappy dug out.." 
"Givin up the nappy, givin up the nappy dug out" 
"Givin up the nappy dug out.." 
"Givin-givin up the nappy dug out.."
Mercy!

Warning: when having sexual intercourse with a female like Cheryl
You must use, jimmy hat condoms
We're called jimmy hats, have you ever seen us?
Most guys wear us round rolled up on your penis
If you're real smart, you will always use us
Put me in your wallet, 'fore some dummy screws us
And goin bare back, without the bare facts
'll have creepy crawlers crawlin on your nutsac!
So get the J-I-M-M-Y to the hats
It's me and two brothers in a pack
"Run out and get your jimmy hats.." 
"Small, and extra large"
"Run out and get your jimmy hats.." 
 Or this might happen to you!
God damn, it's a brand new payback
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
How many motherfuckers gotta pay
Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK
Caps gotta get peeled
Cause "The Nigga Ya Love to hate" still can "Kill at Will"
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
And you can New Jack SWING on my nuts
Down wit the niggas that I bail out
I'm platinum bitch and I didn't have to sell out
"Fuck you, Ice Cube!", that's what the people say
Fuck AmeriKKKa, still with the triple K
Cause you know when my nine goes buck
It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from 12 stories up
Now let's see who'll drop
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man
I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
Make sure before you buck wit duck quick
Punk, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
"I'ma let y'all know one thing man.."

Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin L.M
It's the number one crew in the area
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Punks roll when I put in work
Cause Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
South Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell
Hittin fools up with the big ass L
One time can't hold me back
Sweatshirt, khakis and crokersacs
Stop givin' juice to the Raiders
Cause Al Davis never paid us
I hope he wear a vest
It's all about the L-E-N-C-H y'all know the rest
Muthafuckin' crew, muthafuckin' mob
Do a muthafuckin' job in a muthafuckin' squad
In '91 Ice Cube grew stronger and bigger
And I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
"One-and-two, ah-three-e-and-ah-four-and.."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute"
 Drop a old school beat!

Like I said, it's a brand new payback
Now in '91, let's see whose beats get jacked!
Sir Jinx grew a little bit taller
(Keep the wack beats out)
True motherfuckin' baller
And hoes can't roll on
Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta "Hold On"
Don't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
Goin up against the Zulu
Break his spine like a jellyfish
Kick his ass til I'm smellin shit
Off wit the head, off wit the head I say
And watch the devil start kickin'
Run around like a chicken
Grand Dragon finger lickin'
Yo, turn him over wit a spatula
Now we got, Kentucky Fried Cracker
Mess with the Cube, you get punked quick
Pig, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with!
"Last person in the world you wanna fuck with" (x3)
"Stalking, walking in my big black boots" (Repeat 2X)

God damn, another fuckin' payback with a twist
Them motherfuckers shot but the punks missed
Ice Cube is out-gunned, what is the outcome?
Will they do me like Malcolm?
'Cause I bust styles, new styles, standin' - strong!
While, others +Run+ a +Hundred Miles+
But I never run, never will
Deal with the devil with my motherfuckin' steel - BOOM!
Media tried to do me
But I was a Boy-N-the-Hood before the movie, yeah
Call me nigga, bigot and a spook
But you the one that voted for Duke, motherfucker
White man, is somethin' I tried to study
But I got my hands bloody, yeah
They said I could sing like a jaybird
But nigga, don't say the J-word
I thought they was buggin'
'Cause to us Uncle Sam, is Hitler without an oven
Burnin' our black skin
Buy my neighborhood - then push the crack in
Doin' us wrong from the first day
And don't understand why a nigga got an AK
Callin' me an African-American
Like everything is fair again, shit
Devil, you got to get the shit right, I'm black
Blacker than a trillion midnights
+Don't Believe the Hype+ was said in '88
By the great Chuck D, now they're tryin' to fuck me
"...with +No Vaseline+
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline"—HUH!
It's a great day for genocide (What's that?)
That's the day all the niggas died
They killed JFK in '63
So what the fuck you think they'll do to me?
But I'm the O.G. and I bust back (boom boom)
Bust back (Boom boom!) peel a cap (BOOM BOOM!)
Gimme room in the fire of the sun
Here the mack come, here the black come, watch Jack run!
Motherfuckers can't gank me
Fuck a devil, fuck a rebel, and a yankee
Overrun, and put the Presidency
After needin that, I'm down wit O.P.P., yeah
I met Farrakhan and had dinner
Now you ask if I'm a Five Percenter—well...
No, but I go where the brothers go
Down with Compton Mosque, Number 54
Made a little dough, still got a sister on my elbow
Did Ice Cube sell out? You say, "Hell no!"
A black woman is my manager, not in the kitchen
So could you please stop bitchin'?

"Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots" — Brother J
 Yeah, yeah...
"But when will they shoot?"
"Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots" — Brother J
 Yeah, yeah...
"But when will they shoot?"
(*automatic gunfire*)

You missed, and didn't hit Da Lench Mob either
(Guerillas in the Mist) without Jungle Fever
But I got the fever for the flavor of a cracker
Not a Pringle, bust the single, here's my new jingle
("Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots")
The KKK has got three-piece suits
Using niggas like turkey shoots
My motto is +Treat 'Em Like a Prostitute+
Now if I say no violence, devil, you won't respect mine
Fuck the dumb shit,  and get my Tec-9
And if they approach us
I... I... I bury those cockroaches
And if you can't deal with my +Kill at Will+
Here's a new gift to get, try my +Death Certificate+
+Amerikkka's Most+, Amerikkka's burnt, it's like toast
Like Jordan, I'm goin' coast to coast
Dribblin' the funk
Here comes the nigga with the motherfuckin' monster dunk
Get off me, punk!
"Jordan..." "Watch Jordan
Ayo, Cube, watch Jordan..." "YES!"
"You better eat your Wheaties" — Michael Jordan

"Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots" — Brother J
 Yeah, yeah...
"But when will they shoot?"
"Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots" — Brother J
 Yeah, yeah...
"But when will they shoot?"

Daryl Gates got the studio surrounded
'Cause he don't like the niggas that I'm down with
Motherfucker wanna do us
'Cause I like Nat, Huey, Malcolm, and Louis
Most got done by a black man's bullet
Give a trigger to a nigga and watch him pull it
Negro assassin
I'mma dig a ditch, bitch, and throw yo' ass in
When they shoot, no, it won't be a cracker
They use somebody much blacker
What I do? I called up the Geto Boy(s) crew
'Cause +My Mind's Playing Tricks On Me+ too
Never died, surround my crib
And F.O.I. makin' sure nobody creep when I sleep
Keep a 9 millimeter in my Jeep - PEEP!
When I roll, I gots to roll deep
Ain't goin out cheap
Met the MADD Circle on Cypress Hill 'cause it's so steep
They'll never get me, they'll never hit me
Motherfuck that shit, J-Dee
Now I'm relaxed
Grab the St. Ide's brew so I can max
Sittin' by the window 'cause it's so fuckin' hot
And then I heard a shot - boom
Ay, yeah you, motherfucker. You know who I'm talking to. Yeah, you that motherfucker that betrayed your homeboys and you ain't shit! Yeah, you about to get your motherfucking ghetto pass revoked, motherfucker. Punk-ass mark, bitch-made. Punk-ass trick in a basket... You got caught up in the mix

It's the nigga, ya love to hate, with a new song
So what really goes on?
Nothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch
They hate to see a young nigga rich
But I refuse to switch even though
Cause I can't move to the snow
Cause soon as y'all get some dough
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
Moving out your neighborhood
But I walk through the ghetto, and the flavor's good
Little kids jumping on me
But you, you wanna be white and corny
Living way out
"Nigga go home", spray-painted on your house
Trying to be white or a Jew
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
Get the hell out
Stop being, a Uncle Tom, you little sell-out
House nigga scum
Give something back to the place where you made it from
Before you end up broke
Fuck around, and get your ghetto pass revoked
I ain't saying no names, you know who you are you little punk
Be true to the game

Yeah, motherfucker. Yeah, you thought we forgot, huh? Yeah, get a little money and moves out the neighborhood and shit. But you still ain't shit

When you first start rhyming it started off slow, and then you start climbing
But it wasn't fast enough I guess, so you gave your other style a test
You was hardcore hip-hop
Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped
Giving our music away to the mainstream
Don't you know they ain't down with the team?
They just sent they boss over
Put a bug in your ear, and now ya crossed over
On MTV, but they don't care
They'll have a new nigga next year
Ya out in the cold
No more white fans, and no more soul
And you might have a heart attack
When you find out the black folks don't want you back
And you know what's worse?
You was just like the nigga in the first verse
Stop sellin' out ya race
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
Niggas always gotta show they teeth
Now I'ma be brief, be true to the game

Yeah motherfucker, I see you got your fancy cars and shit, but you know what? You still ain't shit. That's right, I caught you slipping. You know I could've gat you, yeah, but I didn't even trip

A message to the Oreo cookie
Find a mirror, and take a look, G
Do you like what you see?
But you're quick to point the finger at me
You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
Black man can't be no yuppie
You put on your suit and tie, and your big clothes
You don't associate with the Negroes
You wanna be just like Jack
But Jack, is calling you a nigga behind your back
So back off genius
I don't need you to correct my broken English
You know that's right
You ain't white
So stop holding your ass tight
Cause you can't pass
So why you keep trying to pass?
With your black ass
Mister Big
But in reality, you're shorter than a midge
You only got yourself to blame
Get a grip, Oreo, and be true to the game

And Ice Cube practices what he preaches. He continues to live in South Central Los Angeles, and he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood
Be true to the game!
Intro: Little Russ, Ice Cube
 Once upon a time, in the black part of the city
 Yo G, yo G you better get out of here man, 5-0

 Yo Ice Cube, man
 Whassup man?
 Why you...
 Whassup?
 Yo Ice Cube man, why you always kickin the shit about the bitches and the niggas? Why don't you kick some shit about the kids, man? The fuckin kids?!
 Word

Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-C-E
And let me tell ya a story or two
About a punk-ass nigga I knew
Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop
Dropped a line or two, and he had the ho
At that type of shit he's a pro
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way
To make some money, why not?
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out
Saw, her and her friends sellin sheepskins
 Yo yo I got them sheepskins
Yo, my empty sheepskins
Yo baby, what's up with that?
Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence? Yo I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go

Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit!

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
With a joint, drinkin some 8-ball
Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville
Lookin for, the wolf to kill
They're fucked up and they want revenge
Them and Humpty used to be friends
Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And Mister Rogers is gettin mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next
So Mister Rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho
Cause Cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve, givin up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em
Little Boy Blue is up front givin orders
Little did they know Cinderella was a fink
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink
A bad influence? Yo, I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go

 Aiyyo man was that dope enough for you?
 Yeah you aight, you in the house
We outta here, seeeee-yaaaaa
 Yeah you better go home before I whoop your little bad ass
 Some bedtime story huh?

Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride
As the buffalo bitch go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got Daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale
Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for the theme from the Black Hole

Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - "Who is it?"
It's Ice Cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot
She said "Fuck em, cause they get sparked alot"
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
And then I put my Nikes on the coffee table
Her brother came in, he's into gangbangin
Cause he walked up and said "What set you claimin?"
I don't bang I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of Good Times
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
He threw up a set and then he was gone
I'm thinkin to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess, it was sess no doubt
She said please excuse my house and all that
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin at a fucked up black and white
Her mom's bitchin cause the county check wasn't right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister who really needs her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed my forty out the bag and took a swig
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by BeBe Kids
They was runnin' and yellin' and playin' and cussin'
And tellin' and look at this young punk bailin'
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her mom's got the 12 guage Mossberg
The nigga said "yo, what's for sale"
And the bitch came out with a bag of yayo
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars
From a smoked-out fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said "Bitch, I didn't know this was a crack house"
I got my coat and suddenly ...
(police breaking into house annoucing themselves)
The cop busted in and had a Mac-10 pointed at my dome
And I said to myself once again it's on
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said FUCK how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said "Get out my face" and musta had a grudge
His reply, "Tell that bullshit to the judge"
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin'
I said "Aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin'"
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the paddy wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object:
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects
Smooth.. heh.. yep..
Heheheh.. remix..
Just waking up in the mornin gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin from the dogs, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'
Thinkin will I live, another twenty-fo'
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can do it all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all
Which park, are y'all playin basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week messed around and got a triple double
Freakin brothers everyway like M.J
I can't believe, today was a good day
That's right..
Creep to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin, didn't even look in a brother's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of homies and watch me break 'em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Lil' Joe
Picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A
Today was a good day
Hehe..
Left my homie's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryin to do since the twelve grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
Felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my jimmy runs deep, so deep
So deep put her butt to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her butt off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin those high beams
No helicopter lookin for the murder
Two in the mornin got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, "Ice Cube's a pimp"
Drunk as hell but no throwin up
Half way home and my pager still blowin up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
I gotta say it was a good day
Damn, I'm broke
My feet hurt
("Inside the mind of a car jacker")
And that bitch is slipping
It makes me wanna creep
It makes me wanna creep

Damn, I'm such a G it's pathetic
Here comes the big-headed
Nigga that's dipping
Sipping on Courvoisier
Goddamn I must have to floss today
Now pimping ain't easy but it's necessary
So I'm chasing bitches like Tom chased Jerry
I'll put the pedal to the floor
In my two-tone Ford Explorer
You know how it's done
Sounds bumping
Ain't that something
Jumped on the 110
She's flying in the Blazer
Like go Speed Racer
But I ain't gonna chase her
Like Racer X
But I won't flex
Til it's time to have sex
So when you wanna get together
Cause you know a nigga like me
Is down for whatever
And I'm down for whatever

When I was little I didn't wanna be like Mike
I wanted to be like Ike, cause
Papa Was A Rolling Stone in the sixties
And he liked green like Bill Bixby
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty
Pockets never skinny
Played Let's Get It On in the living room
And when he got drunk, you'd better give him room
Cause he'll turn the party out saying
"This is MY muthafuckin house!"
And y'all gots to go through the door
And if you can't find the door
He'll help you with the .44
Talking much shit on the grass
And straight down to blast
I'm still in my PJs;
He's in a turtleneck sweater
And we down for whatever
And I'm down
Solid Pro is down for whatever
The Don Jagwarr is down for whatever
And it don't seem to stop

I don't talk a lot of shit
But when it's time to get busy with these hoes, let's go
Cause I'd rather see a skinhead dead
Then my niggas wearing blue or red
Cause I got the gift
To hit these hoes swift
And I'm smelling like a fifth of something
Yeah, that's right
I'm standing in the store
Koreans act so nice
Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells
Donut
And you know what
I'm Cool Like Dat like Digable Planets
But don't take a nigga for granted
Cause whether it's a verdict or the L.A. four
You just don't know
That this rapping-ass nigga will change with the weather
And be down for whatever

And I'm down
Creep
And I'm down for whatever
Ice Cube - D'voidofpop
And I will never dance for you trick-ass niggas
It makes me wanna creep
It makes me wanna creep
A message to the Oreo cookie:
No matter how much you wanna switch
Here's what they think about you

“You gold teeth, gold chain wearing, fried chicken and biscuit eating monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast running, high jumping, spear chucking, three-hundred-and-sixty-degree basketball dunking, titsun, spade, Moulan Yan. go the fuck back to Africa. go the fuck back to Africa. go the fuck back to Africa.”

Think about it, fuckin' sellout
Here we go on station 103.787 and we're listening to…
We won't be listening to, uh. Ice Cube, Amerikkka’s Most Wanted Because that’s bullshit get that shit outta here
Straight R&B, straight R&B, straight R&B
Where the motherfucking plug at? I'm about to disconnect his ass
Turn off that motherfucking radio

Turn on the radio take a listen
What you're missing
Personally I'm sick of the ass-kissing
What I'm kicking to you won't get rotation
Nowhere in the nation
Program directors and DJ's ignored me
Cause I simply said fuck Top Forty
And top thirty top twenty and top ten
Until you put more hip-hop in
Then I might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the C
And go and dis me in a magazine
How could you figure the brother could dig ya
DJ face down in the river
No it's not a threat but a promise
I'm as
Crazy as they come see
Mama didn't love me
All I got is my nine
And to calm the savage beast here's the Alpine

[Turn off that bullshit!
Turn off that motherfucking radio!
Turn off that bullshit!
Turn off that motherfucking radio!
Turn off that bullshit!
Play the music motherfucker put the music on
Damn!]

Tune in to the radio listen for a minute
Yo G stick a fucking tape in it
Cause all the radio do is gangle
That R&B love triangle
If you're out there kicking it with the brothers
You don't care about lovers
You wanna hear a young nigga on the mic
Going buck wild
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles
That's where I'm coming from
Reality that's what they're running from
So if you're down with Ice Cube let me know that you know
Yo turn off the radio

You know what? You know what?
Basically those black guys and those rap guys
They don't know what the fuck they're doing
I hate those fuckers
I hate em
Especially that one guy
The AmeriKKKa's most wanted
Ice Cube--I hate that fucker
Get him off the air, get him off, get him off
Get that rap shit out of here!]

Hello?
Hi, this is D.E.L
Hey, I'm calling from 3838 Twin Oaks Way
Yeah, I just wanted to call to say fuck the radio!
"There's no stoppin what can't be stopped
No killin what can't be killed.."
"There's somethin out there waitin for us." (repeat 2X)

You can run but you can't hide
From the Westside night stalker, shit talker
Run and tell them it's the L.M
Nigga with the gat and I'm back
Off the everyday prey that I slay
Rollin with a fo' chase ya through South Central
Monkey-wrench ho should know that, she'll get the bozack
Cause I'm not stavin, but fuck that Johnny Carson ho
Never had me on the Late Night Show
Comin with the shit that'll hit
+Steady Mobbin'+ cause the flavor's good
There goes the neighborhood
Nigga with the third album; how come he don't fall off?
Rollin with the sawed-off gauge
Turn the page of the chapter, caught up in the rapture
But you know Anita, she can get the peter
Eat 'em up yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor - here comes the Predator
"Yo I'm out, but - I'll be back" (repeat 4X)

Check your head for the new style
Fuck Laurence Powell and Briseno - Wind and Koon, pretty soon
We'll fuck them like they fucked us and won't kiss 'em
Riots ain't nothin but diets for the system
Fightin with the beast, no justice, no peace
If any, even if we fuck up Denny
Niggas are sick of your white man tricks with no treat
That's right; now it's on, on sight
You call me a Muslim, no I'm not a resident
Still got my vote in - Farrakhan for president
Of white America, I'm tearing ya a new asshole
Who's the nigga with the new black
Strollin to your suburb house and I douse
With gas, now who's cleanin up trash?
Eat 'em up yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor - here comes the Predator
"Yo I'm out, but - I'll be back" (repeat 3X)
"Yo I'm out.."
"Here comes the Predator"
"There's somethin out there waitin for us."

Got my black rag showin and I'm hoin; Ira Reiner
Can kiss my grits like Flo, on "Mel's Diner"
I'm meaner than a motherfuckin hyena chasin antelope
Put my chrome to your dome, watch it bust like a cantaloupe
I can't stand a rope, so don't try to hang 'em
Talk about dogs; boy I can slang 'em
Rat-a-tat-tat on your noggin
Cause Ice'll cream your ass like Häagen-Dazs
Chocolate - I get - crazy when I catch wreck
Even be flippin the tongue like da-diggity-dung Das-EFX
So who is Ice Cube? I'm a rapper, actor, macker
Got a little problem with the redneck cracker, did the tallywacker
Jerry Heller is a devil shit-packer
Comin with a crazy pitch
And the Statue of Liberty ain't nothin but a lazy bitch
Don't wanna give up the crack, to the black
But you'll call it racial, if we go and rape the ho
But eat 'em up yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor - I am the Predator
"Yo I'm out, but - I'll be back" (repeat 3X)
"Yo I'm out.."
"Yo I'm out, but - I'll be back" (repeat 3X)
"Yo I'm out.."
"They indicated, that when trapped, the creature activated
A self-destruct device, that destroyed, enough rainforest
To cover three hundred city blocks." {*KA-BOOM*}
Many motherfuckers criticize pros and how they play
And many motherfuckers criticize rappers and what they say
Even though they criticize secretly they fantasize
But they know they'll never be paid to play
Yeah I'mma kill one of you young punks
With an old school flow, flow, flow

Though I walk through the shadow of death
I gotta make sure that my shoes and my outfit fresh
You bitches get jealous when you see me coming
Y'all would too if you see my woman
Now y'all know we about to do what we do
This shit right here bout as sick as the flu
Drunk motherfuckers wanna vomit on my shoe
Niggas can't have shit probably 'cause of you
Rappers go to jail like Oprah go to Yale
Steffan Policy don't ask don't tell
Wears my Wallabees as I go get the mail
Half black is the new black can't you tell ?
It was blue black like Wesley Snipes in New Jack
Now you got to have a white mama just to do that
Tiger Woods, he used to be a safe nigga
Go ahead let your daughter have a date with him
He'll make with her probablly in a wife beater
Tiger bout to change his name to cheater
I don't like it when you call me Big Poppa
From South Central and I hate helicopters
If we at school I'll break in your locker
See me with a water bottle, it's probably vodka
Drink responsibly or drink constantly
Be who you wanna be in this economy
Drunk as Sean Connery at the finery
Can't throw me out motherfucker I'm the honoree
Trust me, I'll never be the nominee
I don't kiss enough ass, I'm too ornery
Ice cube be where the piranhas be
Swimming upstream eatin' all kind of meat
West Coast treat it like hyenas
Take what you want from these lying ass cheaters
Eat the fuck out these fake-ass beavers
That's how we act when you don't wanna feed us
Crazy motherfucker ever since I was a fetus
Might as well join us you ain't gonna beat us
Please believe us, you can ask Jesus
I'mma be here 'bout as long as Regis
Understand I never pledge of allegiance
To this ball of confusion, might cause a contusion, boy
I see you're cruising for a bruising
Fucking with a principal that don't like students
Don't you know, detention is a lynching
And if I forget to mention then I'm spending out my pension
No no no no

The reason I hone in
'Cause this right here ain't no country for young men
Sonny you done fucked up the Church's money
I'm Redd Foxx and you that big dummy
This junkyard was an empire
Y'all let it get overran by vampires
Most MCs is goddamn lies
Like them fucking supervisors working up at Kaiser
Bitch, I'm not a Dodger, I'm a Laker, punk
You'se a fucking clipper you can call me Jack The Ripper
Cut you up by your guiser then down by your liver
Rooter to the tooter, gut you like flipper
Dipper, y'all better treat me like the skipper
Hair trigger, for e'ry nigga
E'ry honkey and e'ry critter
I come through and kill every litter
Like that like that like that...

No country for young men
No no no no
It's just a world of confusion
No country for young men
No no no no
Your world is just an illusion
No country for young men
No no no no
Its a ball of confusion
No country for young men
No no no no
Your world is just an illusion

Dippin' with that wood grain
So fuckin' hood, mayne
They call me The Boogeyman
In that slow lane, what is your whole name?
I forgot this ho's name, I'll call her Louise Lane
Up on that boulevard, 24's rotate
Ice Cube comin' through, gotta make the hoes wait
Roll at my own pace � nigga, don't hate!
Fuck all you fat-fuckers leanin' up against my paint!
Ice Cube, I steal a little paint (Movie star!)
Fuck you! Pour a nigga a lil' drink!
That's how it's goin' down out here in California
Listen to my people, when a nigga hit the corner!

Do ya thang, mayne

Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the flyest one of all?

Now pull in the parking lot
Nigga, find a parking spot
Fired up, everyone want to spark a lot
Puff-puff-pass, we out on Ave
Lookin' for a big fat ass to harass!
Is it you? Uh-huh, I see you lookin'
When we roll by, pussy still cookin'
Freaks get tooken when they lookin' for stars
If you don't like my face � bitch, look at my car!
Keep it simple, I told you once befo'
It really don't matter how I get you to the mo'
It really don't matter how I get you in my low
Just hop in, let's go
And let your friends know!

We the dogs gettin' chased by the pussycat
West Coast, baby - with so much gravy
You should call The Navy, ever since the 80's
I've been doin' good, they been doin' bad
When I see you walk by, I'm pursuin' that
But never chase it, my game is so basic
As soon as I lace it � baby, wanna taste it?
Just face it, put me to the test
Ice Cube would ace it, I'm built for success
Fuck a Rockstar! We wanna party like a Rap Star
In the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)
You make it rain with ones, I make it rain with hun's
And we get lap-dance from nuns
They put away they crucifix
And they say, "Ice Cube � boy, you the shit!"

Do ya thang, mayne

Could you tell me who unleashed our animal instinct?
And the white man sittin' there tickled pink
Laughin' at us on the avenue
Bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew
We can't enjoy ourselves
Too busy jealous... at each other's wealth
Comin' up is just in me
But the Black community is full of envy
Too much back-stabbin'
While I look out the window I see all the Japs grabbin'
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood
Build a store, and sell their goods
To the county recips
You know, us po niggas; nappy hair and big lips?
Four or five babies on your crotch
And you expect Uncle Sam to help us out?
We ain't nothin' but porchmonkeys
To the average bigot, redneck honky
You say comin' up is a must
But before we can come up, take a look at US

And all y'all dope-dealers...
You're as bad as the po-lice- cause ya kill us
You got rich when you started slangin' dope
But you ain't built us a supermarket
So when can spend our money with the blacks
Too busy buyin' gold an' Cadillacs
That's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'
Exploitin' us like the Caucasians did
For 400 years - I got 400 tears- for 400 peers
Died last year from gang-related crimes
That's why I got gang-related rhymes
But when I do a show ta kick some facts
Us Blacks don't know how ta act
Sometimes I believe the hype, man
We mess it up ourselves and blame the white man
But don't point the finger you jiggaboo
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you
Pretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice
No Ice Cube, just Vanilla Ice
And yall sit and scream and cuss
But there's no one ta blame- but US

US ... will always sing the blues
Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
And if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
"Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'"
Just like a beast
But I'm the first nigga ta holler out {PEACE, BLACK MAN}
I beat my wife and children to a pulp
When I get drunk and smoke dope
Got a bad heart condition
Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's
Bet my money on the dice and the horses
Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces
Go to church but they tease us
Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus
They used to call me Negro
After all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe
No respect and ignored
And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford
In jail cause I can't pay the mother
Held back in life because of my color
Now this is just a little summary
Of US, but yall think it's dumb of me
To hold a mirror to ya face, but trust
Nobody gives a fuck about...
("Peace, quiet and good order will be maintained in our city
To the best of our ability. Riots, melees and disturbances
Of the peace are against the interests of all our people; and
Therefore cannot be permitted.")
("The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty...")
("We've been told that all along Crenshaw Boulevard, that there's a series of fires. A lot of looting is going on. A disaster area, obviously.")
("The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty...")
 Make it rough
("A lot of activity continues here at this command post.")
 Make it rough!!
("We have sporadic fires, throughout the city of Los Angeles.")

Not guilty, the filthy, devils tried to kill me
When the news get to the hood the niggas will be
Hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust
Kickin up dust is a must
I can't trust, a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a unicorn
Born, wicked, Laurence, Powell, foul
Cut his fuckin throat and I smile
Go to Simi Valley and surely
Somebody knows the address of the jury
Pay a little visit, "Who is it?" (Ohh it's Ice Cube)
"Can I talk to the grand wizard," then boom!!
Make him eat the barrel, modern day feral
Now he's zipped up like Leather Tuscadero
Pretty soon we'll catch Sergeant Koon
Shoot him in the face, run up in him with a broom-
-stick, prick, devils ain't shit
Introduce his ass to the AK-40 dick
Two days niggas layed in the cut
To get some respect we had to tear this muthafucka up
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
 Make it rough
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}

I gotta mac-10 for Officer Wind
Damn his devil ass need to be shipped back to Kansas
In a casket, crew cut faggot
Now he ain't nothin but food for the maggots
Lunch, punch, Hawaiin, lyin
Niggas ain't buyin, ya story, bore me
Tearin up shit with fire, shooters, looters
Now I got a laptop computer
I told you it would happened and you heard it, read it
But all you can call me was anti-semitic
Regret it? Nope, said it? Yep
Listen to my big black boots as I step
Niggas had to break you off somethin, give Bush a push
But your National Guard ain't hard
You had to get Rodney to stop me, cause you know what?
We woulda to' this muthafucka up
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
 Make it rough
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
 Ay Muggs, make it rough!
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}

It's on, "Gone With the Wind"
And I know white men can't dunk, now I'm stealin blunts
And a cake from Betty Crocker, Orville Reddenbacher
Don't fuck with the black-owned stores but hit the Foot Lockers
Steal, motherfuck Fire Marshall Bill
Oh what the hell, throw the cocktail, I smell smoke
Got the fuck out, Ice Cube lucked out
My nigga had his truck out, didn't get stuck out
In front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas
Oh Jesus, Western Surplus got the heaters
Meet us, so we can get the 9's and the what-nots
Got the Mossberg with the double-eyed buckshot
Ready for Darryl, and like Baretta would say
Keep your eye on the barrel, a sparrow
"Don't do the crime if you can't do the time"
But I'm rollin, so that's a fucked-up slogan
The Hogan's, Heroes, spotted the guerilla
By the Sizzler, hittin up police killer
The super-duper nigga that'll buck
We had to tear this muthafucka up, so what the fuck!?!
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
 Huh, make it rough!
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
 Yo Muggs, make it rough
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
 Huh, make it rough
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
 Enough!
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}

"At the bottom of our news tonight, there's been a new animal aimed at falling off the face of our Earth. Yes, young black teenagers are reported to be the oldest, and the newest, creatures added to the endangered species list. As of now, no efforts have been made to preserve the Blacks.

(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)

Peace? Hahaha, don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga
How the fuck do you figure
That I can say "Peace" and the gunshots will cease?
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored, they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a nigga's neck
Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And "Fuck tha Police" in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside

All of us are endangered, damn!
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)

You wanna free Africa? I'll stare at ya
Cuz we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over keys
Of cocaine, it was plain and simple
The 9mm went (buck) to the temple
(Buck, buck, buck) was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can, yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out "Ice Cube, sucka"
The shotgun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
"When I got a sawed-off, bodies are hauled off"
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside


Standing in the middle of war, in the middle we flex
When we die, we won't make Jet
Ebony can't see to the light side
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, cause I'm comin’ from the corner
Same applies to a Ph.D
Who's black - don't wanna roll - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin’
Who the fuck are they foolin’?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist
(Standin' on the verge) of them gettin’ brown
That's a fact, got a fear of the bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
Yeah Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!
 Stay off his dick!

Nigga, some don't think I can flow, so here we go
To a new track, to show the wack, that I can throw
Styles that show up, I blow up and blast here
Niggas still tripping off the shit I said last year
About a bitch is a bitch is a ho is a slut
And I don't like niggas on my nuts!
So I dedicate this one to the groupie
And the Charlie, all on my Snoopy
Brothers keep askin, "Ice Cube yo when will you bust"
They surround me and make a big fuss
Now I was taught, back on my block
That you don't ride on nobody's jock
For anything they do, FUCK him and his crew
Unless, you were gettin paid too!
I'm not saying this to diss each and every fan
Women you can ride; men, be a man!
Shake my hand, and make it a FIRM shake
Say, "Whattup Ice Cube?" and then break
Cause if you're hanging near I'mma tell you loud and clear
Get off my my dick, nigga, and tell your bitch to come here
Motherfucker, back up off me
I'm not signing no autographs, I'm not giving no free t-shirts
And I'm not HAVING none of this bullshit you're talking
YouknowhatI'msayin?

I step into the club to rub-a-dub
It seems like all the little hoes fall in love
With my money, cause yo about a year ago
I was just your ordinary average everyday crazy ass broke
But you know, I just can't be equal
Cause they know I know a lot of famous people
But to a one-night stand, there's no sequel
Here's the pickle, pretend it's a Popsicle
See, for a fat booty, I do damage
They think I'm a star, so I take advantage
It's just another Ice Cube groupie fest
She's a ho cause they knew her at the front desk
Told her to meet me at the room 110
And the bitch showed up with her boyfriend
I let him in, all he could do was grin
He had a camera, a t-shirt, a pad and pen
He said, "Yo, Ice Cube, can you sign this?"
I only did it cause his bitch was the finest
She blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown
Like, "How can we get rid of this clown?"
Me and her sat down, he got a little jealous
Cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us
And he asked me question after question
It felt like a motherfucking interview session
Then his girl got up, I heard the door shut
And he was still there, swinging from my nuts
I said, "Get the FUCK out!" and made it loud and clear
Get off my dick, nigga, and tell your bitch to come here
I see me about ten mark ass motherfucking fans
Knock on the door, talking about whassup?
Yo man, it was about a hundred and twenty dicks man
Niggas start, niggas coming out of hotel rooms
Without no bitches!
They can get gaffled like they in a motherfucking raffle
Punk ass

Yo, I respect the respectable
If your girl is all on my dick, check the ho
Say, "Yeah that nigga he can rap fly
But you know, stars are up in the sky"
Cause all I got is hard dick and bubblegum
Just ran out my last stick is where I'm coming from
I'm not telling you to diss Mr. Ice Cube
Cause you know, I'm the one that can show and prove
Now groupie girls, I just make em wait
But the groupie boys, I can't tolerate
I hate it so much, I'mma start giving stitches
To the niggas that's staring like bitches
Cause I'm not a fairy, a Mary or a faggot
Gimme the eye, I'll fly, and tag it
Now you see? Jocking ain't healthy
Cause you think that I'm young and I'm wealthy
With juice, so I see you try to run behind
But I'mma tell you, punk, you gets none of mine
Cause I was taught, see a fool, use a fool
By the niggas who terrorized the old school
So don't try me or buy me a beer
Just stay off my dick, nigga
Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder
What's the date and time, it don't matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers, I was trying to sort
To make a long story short
Ran into, this girl named Carla
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala
She said what's up, yeah what's the deal
Check the hairdo of course it ain't real
Then I looked down she was fat in the front
I asked how long, well about seven months
Oh how time flies when you're having fun
She said "Yeah but the damage is done
Where you been?" "On a little vacation
Oh by the way, congratulations
Who's the lucky man?" I don't have a clue
Then she said "The lucky man is you." I dropped my brew
And everything looked fuzzy
Not a baby by you, the neighborhood hussy
She said "Yeah remember that date?"
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said "Damn, are you sure it's mine?
'Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times"
She said "That day, no I wasn't whoring
Your ass is mine," that's when the sweat started pouring
'Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about giving up the money
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy
Naw 'cause then I'd really get faded
That's murder one 'cause it was premeditated
So what I'mma do, I don't have a clue
How many months left, damn only two
I'm gettin faded

("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...")
No cigar, G

Ay yo, homey, man, I'm getting faded

It's crazy 'cause before I could sleep with her
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her
See the booty and the front was all in place
But the girl had the pitbull face
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid
Oh lord god forbid
My homies see me at the motel
'Cause those fools would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept
And hold your big fat butt steady
'Cause yo, ho, I got the paper bag ready
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing
That I'm a hate myself in the morning
I got drunk to help me forget
Yo another day another hit, shit
I'm gettin faded

("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...")
Ay yo, you know what time it is
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in" "Whoa yeah")

Nine months later she's ready to drop the load
And everybody in the hood already knows
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me
You know Ice Cube can't be having that, G
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger
JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up, they won't shut up
I'm gettin fed up, bitch
'Cause I know you're tryin' to break me
But if I find out your tryin' to fake me
I'm a buff that duff and hoot
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is getting kinda major
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver
Looking like my next-door neighbor
She said it was mine that was her best guess
But let's check the results of the blood test
I started smiling yeah 'cause it read negative
Damn, why did I let her live?
After that I should've got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no I just told the ho who laid me
Excuse me bitch it's a switch
You can't fade me

Naw baby, not this way
Yo, you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger
I don't fall for the okey-doke
And before I fall for the okey-doke, I let the pistol smoke
Now sing it
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...")
Ha ha, yeah baby, you can't fade me
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in" "Whoa yeah")
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...")
Nah, unfadeable baby, yo
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in" "Whoa yeah")

I ain't never got gaffled like that, I used to do the gafflin'
McDonald's is my spot (What you used to do?)
Jack them motherfuckers for them Nissan trucks
Right in the drive-thru.  "Nigga, get your motherfuckin' food, leave it in the car, nigga, get out."  Straight jackin'
You are the prince of darkness
Arch enemy, father of evil
Hell born, demonic, savage, fierce, vicious, wild
Tameless, barbaric, uncontrollabe, obstinate beast

Horny little devil, you gotta back up
Horny little devil, you can't bust a nut
Lookin' at my girlfriend's black skin
You wanna jump in, but she don't like white men
So don't flirt at work, you fuckin' jerk
Or get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker
She ain't with the pale face
Cause y'all fuck at a snail's pace
And you might get sprayed with mace, from the ebony
So when she's doing her job you better let her be
Don't try to pinch the gluterus
Thinkin' that you about to knock out the uterus
Cause she'll tell you to kiss her ass quick
And where I'm from, devils get they ass kicked
Mr. Sexual Harrasment
Asking for a blow and when the answer is "fuck no"
Looks like you wanna terminate
But that's when I go Psycho like Norman Bates
I wanna kill the devil for talkin' shit
Cause he can't get a taste of the chocolate
African breasts; cause white bitches have no butt and no chest
Black women have bodies like goddesses
Sorta like Venus, but put away your penis
Cause the devil is a savage motherfucker
That's why I'm lighter than the average brother
Cause you raped our women, and we felt it
But it'll never happen again if I can help it (me neither)
Cause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet
So horny little devil, you better listen
Before yo' ass come up missin'
And it's like that

Now you wanna get me
Horny little devil must be, a F-A-G
Tryin to fuck me out my land and my manhood
Have me broke eatin' Spam, and canned goods
Locking down on my neighborhoods
Treat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand
But my ass is a virgin
You might have fucked the Indians
But you can't surgeon me
And when I'm on top I won't be fuckin ya
I'd rather put a buck in ya
Cause I hate the devil with a passion
And when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin'
Dig a hole and throw his ass in
And I won't be happy till I'm down to my last ten
Get his fuckin' pitchfork
Tie him up, and then feed the bitch pork
Little devil can't fuck me out my pay
Cause horny little devil true niggas ain't gay
And you can't play with my Yo-Yo
And definitely can't play with me you fuckin' homo
Cause we'll blow your head off
And turn that white sheet, 'to a red cloth
Plus when they're all dead
I can cut that Jheri juice and get a bald head
Then let it nap up
Go down to the corner store and beat the Jap up
Clean all the crap up
Out my city, now the whole block look shitty
Put his dick on a wood block
Swing swing swing, and chop chop chop
Now who's the next to nut
Color Me Badd, but you can't sex me up
So don't even try it, put your dick on a diet
Cause this is Watts Riot 1991 and I'ma get my gun
Put an end to the devil, so get a fucking shovel
(repeat chorus)
Wait a minute, hold on, get your ass up
Whassup nigga?
Get over there... shit
Ya lil punk ass nigga
C'mere, c'mere, c'mere boy
God damnit you stop that shit now
Take him to jail and get him the hell from in front of this house
Now wait a minute, wait a minute, hey man
Whassup?
Wait a minute?
There are police, go!

Give me that beat, fool, it's a full time jack move
Chilly Chill, yo homie make the track move
And I'll jack any Tom, Dick and Hank
That's the name of the SUCKERS I done ganked
I get away from a copper
Drop a dime, I'll break you off somethin proper
With the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B
T-Bone and that's J-Dee
And here's how we'll greet ya
Stop fool, come off that beat ya
Feel dumb cause you're caught in the dark
(ya lil nuttin ass mark)
Raise up, cause you can't' have it back
You said - "I ain't never got gaffled like that"
Off the end of the gat you choke
Short Dog's in the house - "Whattup loc?"
Nuttin but a come up
Gimme that bass, and don't try to run up
Cause you'll get banked somethin sweet
Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob, is jackin for beats

Huh, and even if you're down with my crew
*Yo Chuck man, I don't understand this man
You got to slow down*
I jack them too
And then we'll freak it
Kick that bass, and look what we did
Fade the grade, played, and made a few mil
And I keep stealin
Ice Cube'll make it thump
But right about now - *let's get over the hump*
But I don't party and shake my butt
I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircuts
And it'll drive you nuts
Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch
Like jackin and mackin
Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin
And it sounds so sweet
Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob, is jackin for beats

Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it
Locate a dope break, and then I break it
And give it that gangsta lean
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass
I make punk suckers run and duck because
I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm outtie
So when I come to your town don't crowd me
Cause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me
But I know, none of y'all can get with me
So you think you're protected
Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove
Cause suckers can't fade the Cube
And if I jack you and you keep comin
I'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!
*stop stop stop stop stop!
Sa-prize, niggas*
And now, the wonderous world of..
Hey, come to Los Angeles!
Where you and your family can have peace and tranquility
Enjoy the refinement..
Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?
Hello, my name is Elaine
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles

How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove compartment
Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive

Hi, this is Elaine again
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles?
Or has somebody taken your things?
Have you witnessed a driveby?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again
This is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles

Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
Cause it ain't nuttin but a trap
And females'll get you jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
Cause most niggas get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection, mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a Section 8
Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench ho
And you won't survive in South Central

Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on, punk motherfucker!
And you'll get your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill, Sir Jinx
Aiy'yo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin'
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God dammit!

Rule number three: don't get caught up
Cause niggas are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a price
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
Weed to sherm
Cause South Central L.A., is one big germ
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A., heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin' a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central

Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass you tramp-ass hoes?
You better watch out
And for you so called baller-ass niggas, you know what time it is
South Central ain't no joke
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god dammit
You'll sho' get got, just like that
This ain't no joke motherfuckers
Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer
Puttin' his two cents in
This is Los Angeles
I been servin' niggas since 1985
Niggas want the gutter
Ice Cube, Jay-O Felony
My nigga Gangsta, Squeek Rule
Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangsta

Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Ain't the rugged shit

Keep it gangsta y'all, I want to thank you all
Niggas comin' with that bullshit, it's gankin' y'all
We can ride to this kinda shit and bank them all
Nigga ball 'till you fall motherfucker thats all
Can't none of y'all hang with me putin' in work
Turn this motherfucker up unless you goin' to church
Nowadays, crazy ass bitches want they bills paid
But can't even make a good thang of kool-aid (ha ha)
But chicken heads get chicken feed (bahk bakh)
(a) Lil' dick and weed (bahk bakh)
Everything that a chicken need (bahk bakh)
Tryin' to pot I get real as Chris Rock
Make a bitch hot, turn into Fort Knox (bitch know)
It's Ice Cube comin' straight from the gutter
Westcoast Don, you fags undastata

There is sa-lethal in the gas chamber
I'm full of anger, nigga the west is in the house
But you still in for some danger
And when I'm thru, I take your bitch and finger bang her
But if she looks tossed up, i'll slang her
Beat you like mama dearest with a clothes hanger
Cuz the gang a niggas be tryin' to spit
But you can't spit it like this
I come equiped to rip, any battle
And leave him strung in his crew
But they put me in the twist like Trump
I can collapse or puncture, the lungs of anyone
Give him a chance to spit his last word, unerve
Then he done
20/20 ain't good enough
Rappers they ain't seein' me, this Jay-O Felony
And nobody can stand three of me
Caution keep MC's out of my reach, I'm on a mission
And be gettin' to your fuckin' hide to be called a physician
Immediately, I puts it down at a show (Jay-O)
But loked to choke the shit out a fool, nigga dat's on doo low

Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (keep it gangsta)
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (keep it gangsta)
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (all my life)
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (all my life)

I'm sick of these rap niggas lyin' 'bout they rich (what?)
Lyin' 'bout they bitch (what?)
Lyin' 'bout they dick (what?)

Lyin' 'bout they rows (uhh)
I'm sick of these rap niggas lyin' 'bout they house (punk!)

It's the Mah-hurage-ny, my niggas; kamekaze
Illuminaughty, bitch hoes in they body
We the riders, we push like mahz-er-aties
Do karatees, on hatters, and you hotties
Fuck the party, come on, my niggas focus
We the richest, pretend that we the brokest
Niggas notice, as soon as you're checking quotas
We the coldest, so go and tell the rollers (biotch!)

Who dat? next out the game, in blue kahks
Gangsta's the name, niggas wonderin' how I do that
By the thug way, package and transportin' the drug way
Only means of makin' a livin', the Crip and Blood way
I'm on grates when I'm grindin'
I'm on stakes when I'm dinnin'
And on sunday's on the wine
Is you can't calm the savage beast (never)
And I can make your birds rise like geese, K-Mac tell 'em
You sell 'em, I swell 'em, loke (sell 'em loke)
Hard or soft determines how much a nigga sell 'em for
We got the fish scale texture (fish scale)
Now if you cook it yourself you get extras
Dub that shit to death with this dub thang
Only a few niggas left with this love mang
So we cop together (yeah), put it in the beeker
Rock together (uhh), claim blocks together
And fuck cock together, nigga (brrrph!)

Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Ain't the rugged shit


Look in my eyes
I see the dollar sign dogg, and my dick start to rise
Got to handle money, got to stack the money (tell 'em)
Buzzin' like a bee cuz I crave for the honey
Million dollar tickets make bitches look wicked
So you innocent hoes, ain't got to like ta kick it
I know you knows (uhh), cuz now my decimals (yep)
Done fiend for the green, keep you itchin' in your panty hose
Your eyes full of gleem (brrrmmph!)
You wanna get on my team, and live my dream
Captain of the ship is what I'm boastin'
Hit the three wheel motion, I'm the shit when I'm coastin' (uh huh)
Down the boulevard, flossin' hard
Lights hit the chrome, don't go lick 'em like a movie star
Money makes me a savage (what it do?)
Shit, I brake down the world for the cabbage (Squeek Rule)

Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (all my life)
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (all my life)

Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Ain't the rugged shit
In any country, prison is where society sends it's failures. But in this country, society itself is failing

Tadow, how you like me now, I'm in the mix?
It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota
Got the baking soda, let the water boil, workers all loyal
Dropped out the twelfth
Cuz my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees
Now I slang keys
Infest my hood with crack, cuz I'm the mack
Take a nation of millions to hold me back
Too big for my britches, and I got bitches
Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches
Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5
'89s the number, another summer
Police ain't get no dumber
Streets dried up, used to think it would last
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past
They tried to blast me for selling a boulder
Now I got my ass in Minnesota
Got my own crew, it's on brand new
Damn, what can I do?
Tadow...

Already done stack me half a mill ticket
Bought a house next to Prince, so now I can kick it
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz
Goin' to see the Twins, play at the dome
Police are tappin' my mobile phone
I'm almost home
Gettin' excited, indicted, spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest
And everything I own got repossessed
Now take a look at the dust
And I'm happy cuz I only got 36 months
Never picked up a book
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look
Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew
And see, what can I do?
Tadow...

Phucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-fo
Back in LA, and I'm bailin' in the dough
Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch
So where to work at, and niggas smirk at
Me say ain't nuttin' poppin from here to the LB
What you tell me?
No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe
Cuz, they sent in the troops
Even tho I got muscle, that ain't my hustle
Takin' niggas sh*t in a tussle
No skills to pay the bills
Takin' 'bout education to battle inflation
No college degree, just a dumb ass G
(Yeah you Nigga, who me?)
I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess
Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes
Took some advice from my Uncle Fester
All dressed up in polyester
Welcome to McDonalds may I please help you?
Sh*t, what can I do?
Tadow...

I put money on the books for my nigga J-Dee
See Shorty is a Muslim use to be crazy
I ate dinner with Martin
And had meetings with Magic
Chopped it up with 2Pac
Before it was a tragic

They call me Hollywood
Red carpet
V.I.P. bitch
They call me Hollywood
Complimentary everything
Give me a black goddess sister I can't resist her. No stringy haired, blonde hair, blue eyed, pale skinned buttermilk complexion. Grafted, recessive, depressive, ironing board backside straight up and straight down. No frills, no thrills, Miss six o'clock, subject to have the itch, mutanoid, caucazoid, white cave bitch...
Verse One: Ice Cube
Ease back white bitch, I don't play that
Just because I got on my L.A. hat
Stalkin' walking in my big black boots
Is my jingle, now you want Mandingo
Big, black and handsome
I should hold your devil ass for ransome
Sorta like Patty Hearst, but I'll burst first bitch
And you know what's worse
I'm coming from the land where the choppers roam
So fuck you bitch and your Coppertone
Stringy hair - no derrier - frontin' and fakin' with your silicone pair
Do I wanna fuck? Not hardly
That's kinda like Barbie fuckin' Bob Marley
It ain't gonna happen, I keep rappin'
Motherfuck Tennille, but see I'm the Captain of this ship
And I'm true to the game
Ya all look the same
Standin' by my backstage door, hopin' that'll switch
Spread out you little cave bitch
Verse Two: Ice Cube
Why everytime we get famous
You wanna play us like Andy and Amos?
The devil sent you to try and tame us
But you can't tame me, with no bitch named Amy
Lookin' for the dark meat
But ho, I ain't tryin' to go out like Barkley
Cuz everytime I turn on the TV
I see several brothers with she-devils
Smilin' cuz you out on a date
But sooner or later, the bitch'll yell rape
Soon as daddy found out you a jigaboo
He'll kill like he did Emmitt Till
Yah, he tried to kick bass
But the bitch probably threw it in his face
Southern Belle ain't nothin' but a trick
Nasty as hell, stanky little cave bitch
Verse Three:
Now don't think that I hate you
Cuz I won't date you, bitch I gotta stay true
You can be a fan, but don't expand
And try to get my dick in your hand
You better run to the minute man
Pale as snow, so act like y'know
Cuz if I slap it, flip it, and rub it like that
Yeah, it gotta be black
Plus yo ass too flat
I need a butt big enough that can clap
Rat-a-tat-tat
You can't get mine ho
I'd rather fuck an albino
Atleast I know, she's comin' from the Nubian
And not the Ku Klux Klan that you be in
And I don't give a fuck if your family is rich
You're still a little cave bitch
*Gun shot* "Ain't nobody talkin when I'm talkin fellas so shut the fuck up!"
("And who the fuck are you?")
Ohh.. steppin up in my motherfuckin uhh..
Chuck Taylors, Knick kickers, Wallabee's
On my ass I got the umm.. um.. khakis, 501's
On my back I got the uhh.. sweatshirt
You know, with the fat three creases
Uhh, my t-shirt, Slingshot, uhh.. khaki shirt
Umm, and I got the Cake cutter in my—in my pocket
Uhh, got the afro, the braids
Motherfuckin uhh, rollers
"You got to believe in somethin"
And I just ask my motherfuckin self, uhh
"Why not believe in me?"

To G or not to G, is the question
And like Smith told Wesson
I'm shady with the .380 old school diploma
I'll leave that ass in a coma, so
If you got a herringbone, Welcome to the Terrordome
Two-eleven, sorry Reverend
Oh my god, gettin robbed
Reach for the smog, "Atomic Dog"
Hard to swallow, janky as Rollo
Count to ten, and don't try to follow
Cause just like Waco, I can take fo'
ATF, to they death
Bust a left on Western, go and get a room
Don't want to be a felon like Stacey Koon
Get the right bitch, hit the light switch, here we go
Tap that ass like this - really doe

"You got to believe, somethin.."
West Side Lynch Mob
"I got to believe in me.."
Cause I'm a motherfuckin G
Cause I'm a mother-fuckin..
{"And who the fuck are you?"}

Thirty in a holdin tank, catch the vapors
Make me a pillow out of toilet paper
Concrete bench kickin' off the hemorrhoids;
Eses deep, don't fuck with dem boys
Phone check, collect call from the baller
Her mama said please don't call her
Do-Wah-Diddy, far from New Jack City
Seen one of my peers, "What the fuck you doin in here?"
He said, "One-eighty-seven on the enemy
And they treat me like I just shot a Kennedy!"
Deputy bitch thinks she's the Queen Bee
Ink on my thumb, index, and pinky.
"Sir, what set you from?" Play dumb
"General popu-la-tion"
Mama put your house up, and I can bounce up
Out this motherfucker, that's why I love ya
Out like a boss, with a half-pint of sauce
Got the shit sewed up like Betsy Ross
What a friend know? Buy some indo
Never fuck with a silly ho - really doe


Knock you out like NyQuil, I'll kill you quick
You sucker-for-love-ass trick
So don't run up, wit ya gun up
Cause I got the back breaker, double pump rump shaker
Cause we can play hookie in the Aqua Boogie
With concrete Nikes, ya gets no stripes
Livin unforgiven with the mic on
And punks runnin like roaches with the light on
And that's all the shit I'm startin
Bust a cap (ka-kow-POW) like Jerome on Martin
You lookin for a punk with benefits
Cause you got a baby, that take many shits
And you know I got a grip like a baby on a tit
Scopin', hopin', thighs open
But I kick back, six-pack, and hit the Phillie slow
Hooker ho - really doe
Here's another day at the stoplight
I'm lookin' in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test
With four brothers in the SS
I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin' in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slippin', I'm fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Do these fools got a problem with me, or do they got love?
And when the light turn green, I don't bone out
I wanna see what these black men are all about
Cause if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport
First they get behind my ride
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scopin' out the one smokin' indo
Comin' up fast, rollin' down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, cause I'm color blind

Killa Cali, the state where they kill
Over colors cuz brothas don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop
And he won't stop and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed
And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong word
Then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
But men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me
Cuz I slang these thangs like a G
It's on, is anybody killin' for the summertime
I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind

I'm fresh outta county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
Cuz everyday, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color, or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story
So what's left, the judge goes deaf
When you try to tell your side
And you ain't blue eyed
Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin'
And just hand your car keys over to your woman
Because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now, I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even shed a tear
Cuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph
Cuz brothas, you don't know the half
On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
But ever since I've been down
I'm colorblind

Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, Young and dumb and full of cum, I’m a baby loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke

Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin'
Cuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin'
Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side

Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the 5 dollar stick and I put in my clip

So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross

Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes
Thinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side

I ain't contributin to genocide (why?)
Cause I'm colorblind

Niggas in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
Cuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way I get burned.
Baby Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red
Put 'em together and we color 'em dead
Dead, dyin, gettin smoked's like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral

I understand how all my homeboys feel
Cuz I been shot; to this day, I pack my steel
Cuz I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
With blue and red bandanas on the street
And if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep
Cuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind
And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind
The army is the only way out for a young black teenager
We'll provide you with housing
We'll provide you with education. 
We'll provide you with everything you need to survive in life. We'll help you to be the best soldier in the U.S. of A
Because we do more before 7 A.M than most niggers do in their whole lifetime

I'm comin!, I'm comin!
I'm comin!, I'm comin!

I wanna kill him, cause he tried to play me like the trick
But you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
I got the A to the motherfuckin K, and it's ready to rip
Slapped in my banana clip
And I'm lookin'
Is he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?
It seems like he got the whole country behind him
So it's sort of hard to find him
But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth
Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
Cause the shit he did was uncalled for
Tried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore
And that shit ain't fly
So now I'm settin up, the ultimate drive-by
And when you hear this shit
It make the world say "DAMN!", "I wanna kill Sam."
"Do the niggas run this moth-er-fuck-er?" (repeat 2X)
{​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​*door knocking*}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
"Momma! Some man at the front do'!"
"Sit yo' ass down."
"Uh hi, I have reason to believe that someone in this household has just turned eighteen, am I correct?"

Here's why I wanna kill the punk
Cause he tried to take a motherfuckin' chunk of the funk
He came to my house, I let 'em bail in
Cause he said he was down with the LM
He gave up a little dap
Then turned around, and pulled out a gat
I knew it was a caper
I said, "Please don't kill my mother", so he raped her
Tied me up, took me outside
And I was thrown in a big truck
And it was packed like sardines
Full of niggas, who fell for the same scheme
Took us to a place and made us work
All day and we couldn't have shit to say
Broke up the families forever
And to this day black folks can't stick together
And it's odd
Broke us down, made us pray - to his God
And when I think about it
It make me say "DAMN! ...I wanna kill Sam."
"I'm comin'!" (repeat 3X)

Now in ninety one, he wanna tax me
I remember, the son of a bitch used to axe me
And hang me by a rope till my neck snapped
Now the sneaky motherfucker wanna ban rap
And put me under dirt or concrete
But God, can see through a white sheet
Cause you the devil in drag
You can burn your cross well I'll burn your flag
Try to give me the HIV
So I can stop makin babies like me
And you're givin' dope to my people chump
Just wait till we get over that hump
Cause yo' ass is grass cause I'ma blast
Can't bury rap, like you buried jazz
Cause we stopped bein' whores, stop doin' floors
So bitch you can fight your own wars
So if you see a man in red white and blue
Gettin' chased by the Lench Mob crew
It's a man who deserves to buckle
I wanna kill Sam cause he ain't my motherfuckin Uncle!
"We've gone nowhere in 200 years?" "That's correct."
"We-we-we've gone nowhere in 200 years?" "That's correct."
"We-we-we've gone nowhere in 200 years?" "That's correct."
Hey yo Cube, man, hey yo Cube, check this out
Yo, motherfuckers be on the dick and shit, right?
Check this out, you know what I tell 'em, man?

Well two peas in a bucket
Mother motherfuck it
You either Flavor Flav it
Or you Chuck Chuck Chuck it
Kiss my ass and suck the D.I.C.-
K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me
I fucked that lady in the bed
I missed that pussy and the butt was spread
I tried it again in a thumping wagon
The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging
Tried it again in a field of grass
I missed that pussy and I bust my ass
Then I fucked this lady in the tree
The baby came out and said "Run-DMC"
Yeah, and you don't stop
Flavor Flav in the house, and you don't stop
Ice Cube's in the house, and you don't stop
Hey, my sugar (Hey, yo, rock that shit G!)

I knew this girl who looked just like you
Light brown and a fly hairdo
I wanted to do her, screw her
So I stepped to her on key
Bitch had more ass than a donkey
I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over
Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over
Just call me the plumber at the end of the night
Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe
She didn't get offended it was splendid to me
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be
I guess I'll just wine her and dine her
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her
Waxing that ass like Raindance
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her
Took her to the Comfort Inn, tucked her in
Pulled out the third leg pumped it in
She said 'Will you call me?'
Yeah, I'll call you a bitch or a ho after I ball you
Naw I'm just playin' but it's still the same
Cause a nigga like Ice Cube is only out for one thang

FF: Yeah, what you out for?
IC: Yo, I'm only out for one thing
FF: You out for what, man?
IC: Yo, I'm out for the pussy, the money, and the mic, and I'm straight. What are we out for?
FF: I pledge allegiance to the uh... to the fuckin', all of that shit. Know what I'm saying?
IC: Five thousand!
FF: Five thousand, G
IC: We out
FF: Yo, we out of here, five thousand
Yo, this is for my boy Ice Cube, you know what I'm saying
Yo, check this out
