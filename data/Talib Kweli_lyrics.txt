We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too, like Attack of the Clones
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors
We're survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth, they hot like a jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Cor' bailed me out
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy
Through the red sky with the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, Living to Let Die

This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

We keepin' it gangster, say fo shizzle, fo sheezy, and stayin' crunk
It's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stayin' drunk
Yo, I activism, attackin' the system, the Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen, they're victims lackin' the vision
Shit, and all they got is rappin' to listen to
I let them know we missin' you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin' you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly, the TV got us reachin' for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin' for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin' to rely on, we get high on
All types of drug, when all you really need is love
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon: imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop

This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
And I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

Yoyoyo, yo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Turbo-charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to yo mufuckin' self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
'Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

When you a man, action is what’s expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em
It’s carpe diem hey (hey) yeah

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Like kindergarteners
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in–
–to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck has been
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
I'm focused

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through
Another night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Another night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel

I wish I could talk to Lauryn
I mean excuse me, Ms. Hill
And let her know how much we love her is real
The industry was beating her up
Then those demons started eating her up
She need a savior that'll bleed in a cup, yup
We used to kick it in the salad days
When she look at me like she ain't know me when she see me nowadays
I nod, she nod back, that's how it stay
Her songs still better than anything out than "Hot" or "Power" play
Remember how they accused her of saying, he did her album without help
Then she went to Rome to sing and tell the Pope about herself
Just after she left the Fugees, started rolling with the Marleys
Got back with her crew at Dave Chapelle's Block Party
She made songs about Zion and trying to be faithful
Took Black Star on tour in Europe, I was so grateful
Speaking for myself but I'm sure I could speak for Dante
I got to watch a show with Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte
We used to chill at Nkiru, her moms was a customer
She used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler
Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren
What the album did for black girls' self-esteem was so important
I got concerned when she got sick on the road
She ain't healthy,, I'm a brother
And I wish that I could pick up the load, but no


Got your assistant on the the phone, "I need to talk to Lauryn"
And I wanna walk through the storm, and I could be the umbrella when the rain is pouring
Please, this no disrespect to whoever your man is, though
This relationship is strictly music like D'Angelo
I know you hate Babylon, and wanna see it fall
But they won't let you read your poem at the BET awards
You give us hope, you give us faith, you the one
They don't like what you got to say
But still they beg you to come, whoa
Now that's powerful sis, it's black power
We get money, keep our eyes on the final hour
And no I ain't saying you Christ, that would be sacrilegious right?
But you can blow and you nice, sisters them raps is vicious
The raps the sisters recite with their black fist up
The devil's last wish is a queen that rise past bitches
We used to read Francis Crest or anything
By Third World Press impressed
But what the power of the word suggest
Hatched ideas in our heads like birds in the nest
You gave birth to a new sound like Donda West, yes
Should I be saying all of this while the mic is on?
I might as well let it out because one day I might be gone
I write this song and hope you feel how much we love you
And you play it, cause I really ain't got the words to say it
But yo
History, it's happenin' every day, y'all (right now)
Everyday (live, right now)
Right now (good mornin', Vietnam!)

Listen! Brooklyn wins again
It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, them niggas again
Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and S. Dot on the guest lock
Kanye, you're the dopeman of hip-hop, now let's rock
Now roll out, niggas, my hometown niggas
I get it good in yo hood, so slow down, niggas
Watch the speed though, mind your pedal and ease off
Or screech off into a collision course with these walls
(BAM!) They don't move, don't pray, don't lose
Don't sleep, life passin', light flashin', life happens
That fast, part of done, black hands up in prayer
Black guns up in fear, dyin' wish is to touch the air
Seekin' heaven that wasn't here
Eyes will not see another year, it's another day
It's the same fight, different round, sound the bell
Mix it up in victory, you live it up, the beat'll get risen up
You're knocked down, then get back and get it up
Get off of queer street and get with us
And get clear where we did it, from the heart, from the people
From the top, from the jeep, from the gut, from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
So in my absence you feel the presence, exactly
I make contact, for short, I MC
Me and mine we don't just get by
We get free and that's ready 

Just to get by
Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lah, carried a fo' five
Claimed I was ready to die, promised never to cry
Held it all inside, reality was too much to take, so I
Kept my mind fried, slept for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes, then I woke up behind
Thinkin' either I load up these 9's, or blow up with rhymes
‘Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein' your moms
Doin' five dollars worth of work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me workin' McDonald's! I'd rather pull a MAC on you
Sorry, Ms. Jackson, but I'm packin', bye!

Yeah! It's somethin' about that Nina Simone piano flow
It's like a Michelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music get ya choked up, this is the tree and the rope
This is Chi, nigga, I'm Mr. All-of-That
Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on the almanac
Dice what they hittin' fo', lax what you sittin' on
Tracks who you spittin' on, rap 'til we get it on
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme
They used to tell me, "Toughen up, put some bass in your voice!"
They used to tell me, "Lighten up, put some Mase in your voice!"
Lord willin' I ain't killed nobody
But I have a feelin' this album that I'm gonna make a killin'
Or not a shilling, this is love-it-or-hate-it music
But—at least we made it music
And we didn't make it industry, this is gon' be interesting
This'll be the end of me, or I'm finna be an entity
Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli
We are not makin' songs no more, we're makin' history

This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
But I been thinkin' I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)
(Just to get by, just to get by)
(Just to get by), just to get get buh buh buh bye bye

We keep it gangsta, say 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy'
Desensitized by the violence on the TV during the war
Killin' each other is easy, its pourin' liquor for fallen niggas
Believe me, it's ghetto libation, seen it all before
Just to get by, my people, we get fly
My people, we get high, fillin' cigars with the lah
Nigga, come on! Even Jesus was stoned
Before receivin' the throne
I send a rest in peace to Nina Simone

Back in the days we was used to doin' the shit
I can't call it all in the streets
We was hustlin' fiends that asked for it
I guess I was used to just standin' on corners
Waitin' for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin' the week was good, so I could get money back
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin' me smokin' Newports and weed
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my niggas and street mothafuckas
And reach out to wifey, and then I place a call on my mother
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
*Ayo, Mom, pick up the phone, I gotta to talk to you, Ma*
If you was five percent instead of actin' stupid and guessin'
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building in session

This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
But I been thinkin' I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)

Some people try, some people try
Just to get by, for my piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie
And we keepin' it fly – yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
When people decice to keep a disguise
Can't see your eyes, see the evil inside
The best people you find
Stronger people in mind
I stay readin' the signs
I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Why you so far away? You need to feel this
I've got somethin' to tell you, come here real quick
I've done dirt in the past, I know that love hurts
I'll come for you, but my lady's got to come first
I can tell by your hesitation there's trust issues
You get excited, ignite it, highly combustible
You on a higher vibration, that's why I fuck with you
Left me provide for you, comfortable as a Huxtable
Your whole style is colder than Minnesota
I love your profile, the way you look over shoulders
At the crib, I'm hopin' you come over
We can do it like Common and Mary and come closer
We can do it like Barack and Michelle, give me a fist bump
Black magical, act radical with the fist up
Do it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop
Promise you I'm not gonna tell, we keep our lips locked

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Like a Spike Lee movie, I'm movin' across the floor
Feelin' love in the music, I'm using it like a lure
I love how you do, with your beauty and your allure
Make you come like the ocean, approaching me like "sure"
She Rockefeller Center like Diego in the lobby
As valuable as The Scream or a Salvador Dali
She popular with the thieves and wanna be Thomas Crown
Some try to steal her attention as soon as I'm not around
This last bird probably flew the coop
Blastin' Outkast, last words: "Ooh-Dee-Whoo"
I don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful
Je ne sais quoi... how you say, "voulez vous?"
Pardon my French, with the tongue kissin' I'll make her come hither
'Til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her
I'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor
But fix my composition and give a proposition to consider

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Hey you, hey you, hey you
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Hey you, hey you, hey you
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me

Black Madonna, you sow the seeds like a farmer
While I manage, just serving long sentences, no commas
Write poetry in your honor, your body is like a sauna
The promise, you gettin' closer to the sun, you gettin' hotter
You the Earth, that's emphatically "yes"
But I still call you a bad bitch, under my breath, out of respect
Naturally blessed, Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh
I ain't gotta ask her "why you stare" - that's a "yes"

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby
I know there's a first time for everything
First time I let her in my bed she got wetter then the perfect storm
That we weathering together and
This the first time that I've ever considered wedding rings
But first things first yo
I met her at the bar rolling with three wise men like I followed the star
There she is shorty bi coastal
Thick like bifocals, stacked like 2Pac vocals her body so loco
Jewel of the Nile so I'm romancing the stone
The rhythm is to the words and I watched her dance to my poems
The way she move them hips let me know in advance that she grown
I pictured it like Paris Hilton when she answered the phone, yo
Dancing alone because she extra fly
But I got good look so I catch her eye
Gave the rest a try now give the best a try
Leave your nest and I'll fly make you testify
Damn baby I know we got some haters and

I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to seeing
Because I never been in love before

You running back to the kid like this was home base
Or a marathon I let you set your own pace
Your own space and the beautiful struggle
Now baby tell what's it gonna take to prove that I love you
When I'm gone you be missing me too
It let me know that my prayers is the music God be listening to
Don't get it confused I'm trying to get religious with you
I never thought I feel like this its like a miracle you
You You stole my heart like a crook in love
Crossing the bridge to the Brooklyn love
When I took above it's clear skies that's surrounding my earth
Your love is drugs and I'm down to serve let's deal with it yo
We go to the spot and you still get it low
I get excited fast and still love to hit it slow
Till the walls come tumbling down like Jericho
And you hear the sound is stereo
Here we go


You looked good when I tried you on
So I had to write a song
Use to be the guy that always made her cry when I'm gone
Always kept a stable and I never spent a night alone
No cable or no hard line phone why
I'm never home scared of commitment
Ready to forever roam
We at war like sister souljah and she welcome to my terror dome
Head strong our connection proved them haters dead wrong
From now to R.I.P. Proceeds my name up on the headstone
Leave her be for five minutes
Dudes try to dive in it first
They want to spit on my name and tarnish my image
I tell them do you I don't care who she speaking with
Because I already know she made it clear who she leaving with
And it feels so beautiful
Put it in a rhyme because it feel so musical
Plus you ain't no groupie ho
Sitting in the studio
Before we do this though there something that you should know
Ayo Fed wassup bro?
Wassup with me? You know what's up with me man
I'm trying to get paid in full
Check this out right
Since Javotti is the label
And I'm talking over this def beat right here
I think we should turn it up
We got my man (Tr-tr-Trend on the beat)

Thinking of the master plan
Where there’s nothing but cash inside my hand
Wanna dig into my pocket my prophet is heaven sent
I dig deeper, you know I represent, represent
Yeah, money over bitches, my sisters go over everything
My bandz will make you dance, I'm forever like a wedding ring
Far above the hate and, the jealousy that the cheddar bring
Trying to get away from the 85ers like Evelyn
Ride with me, I got ‘em leaking like Nene
Got ‘em leaking like Wiki, these monkeys biting like hickeys
Cause they’re seeing what I’m doing, filling them with confusion
Cutting just like a truant, I’m fluent just like a student
Of the romance languages, only the diamonds hang with us
My meal is decorated with garnishes just like your wages is
The crib’s outrageous like really it's no joke
The girl of your dreams be coming over to smoke loud

Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people

You can feel the heat from your speaker, my sound will darken your features
Run it down like a zebra, I move with the speed of cheetahs
I’m from Brooklyn where the heat is the size of a two-litre
I ain’t asking for no followers, I'm looking for new leaders
Is hard not consuming all the bullshit they feed us
Intravenous like a cord to the womb from the fetus
Been hard since I started reading, alliteration is literally littered
Through my DNA swimming all through my semen
So every time I bust, babies begin being born
Talk turns tough til them toasters that's tucked get
Drawn like a picture, picture a perfect painting
Police profiling people peacefully praying
Lay the law like leaders the lazy is lollygagging
On my grind getting guap, guess green is the new black
Meet me at the bar, we throwing a few back
Hopped out the car, you know who blew that loud


Ayo we drink good, smoke good
These cats wearing funny hats like the pope would
I come in looking quite clean in the loafers
So hood might scheme up to no good
You no crook, Gosling in the Notebook
I got the birds on the wire like I know I Wood
I still rep P.O.C.s like I'm supposed to
Coming live from death row like I know Suge
My rhymes like a laser beam - so focused
I’m in the ring, so lean I need a foam cup
I ain't lying, bare teeth so ferocious
Maybe I’m lying bare feet in the ocean
On the beach fall asleep and I'm floating
To the beat so unique like a potion
I love music, I’m complete in my devotion
(Word, say it again)
I’m complete in my devotion
I'm on that homicide, suicide, drama like Islamabad
Under God, going overboard like the Amistad
Ringing bells, it was 2012 back in 95
I made it out alive, now finally I've arrived
But still threw back to all my other blue black
People that's sticking to it like, mice to a glue trap
My work speak for itself so I don't interrupt
I am an expert, this is no beginners luck
If you denying the truth, then I don't give a fuck
Otherwise get your hands and your antennas up
As we go into our initial descent, I'm alive, but only fifty percent
I wasn't listening to that intuition now I'm in that system again
And I'm praying God give me the strength
I'm drifting into a dark place, tryna keep this part of my heart safe
My soul basically been shark bait, my body's in bad shape

Spitting that fire flame, on a higher plane, going poltergeist
Life a game, ain't no referee, I can't hold it right
Bring the rain, praying to the Lord for it to pour tonight
Bring the pain, fucking with that meth, I'm on that Walter White
There ain't no maybes, baby, make it or you don't make it
You gotta take it, take it, take it or you gon' get taken
Can I get a church from the congregation?
Can I get a church from the congregation?

I'm on that armageddon, public devastation, come in the Revelations
Rap Jehovah, knocking pastors over while I pass the dosha
Lord forgive him, but I keep cutting these records like a sword was with 'em
Mixing it with the medicine, attempting to warn the children
Of what the future holds, slaves of monatomic gold
Seems the problem is atomic, but it's microscopic though
I'm courting hoes and pouring fours, there must be something more than this
Hopefully I'm immortal and I'll never need a mortician
All my thoughts is black, Kweli on the track
My reflection is eternal even if the mirror cracks
And I don't wear no watch, cause I ain't got no time
Solar system, this is astronomy not a rhyme
We bringing the real back, y'all ain't have no spine
So spin the reel back, nigga press rewind
Soak it all in, that is until you're dry
I'm throwing the peace and eating a piece of devil's pie, I'm...


A dialectic
Attract cofollowings like scientologists reading the dianetics
This religion that I invented, it's really a way of life
These thoughts of freedom that I embedded is reaching you through the speakers
These poison animal leaders is weaker than niggas with fever and sweeter than diabetics
Get deaded trying to set it, they'll tie you up like a fetish
They'll gas you up like unleaded and let it off
'Til you wetter than spaghetti sauce and lettuce chopped up with your body left in a crevice
We the reverends performing exorcisms
Exercising the right to fight for the dedicated
Concentrated few that's left who listen
God is with them like we started a mission, following God is wisdom
God is risen like followers of Elijah finding God in prison
We praying for that work, we need that occupation
Can I get a church from the congregation
If you sick of the same conversation
You say you make it rain but that's just condensation
My mama said life would be so hard
Growing up days as a Black girl scarred
In every way, still; you've come so far
They just know the name they don't know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Don't be ashamed of yourself know I
Will carry it forth til the day I die
They just know the name they don't know the pain, Black girl

I do it for the people, I do it for the love
I do it for the poet, I do it for the thug
This is for victory, and this is for the slaughter
I do it for my mother, I do it for my daughter
Promise I'll always love ya, I love to kiss and hug ya
You and your brother should be looking out for one another
I'm so blessed, man, y'all the reason I got up
Somebody put his hands on you I'm getting locked up
I'm not playing, that's the prayer I'm saying for Diani
And if I die then she'll be protected by Amani
That's her bigger brother and I love the way he love her
She a girly-girl, she love to imitate her mother
But she a Gemini, so stay on her friendly side
She'll put that look on you, it's like somebody friend just died
My pretty Black princess smell sweet like that incense
That you buy at the bookstore supporting Black business
Teach her what black is; the fact is her parents are thorough
She four reading Cornrows by Camille Yarborough
I keep her hair braided, bought her a black Barbie
I keep her mind free; she ain't no black zombie
This is for Aisha, this is for Kashera
This is for Khadijah, scared to look up in the mirror
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a Black girl name, she living Black girl pain
This is for Makeba, and for my Mamacita
What's really good Ma, I'll be your promise-keeper
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a black girl name, she live in black girl pain


This is for Beatrice Bertha Benjamin who gave birth to Tsidi Azeeda
For Lavender Hill, for Khayelitsha
Athlone Mitchell's Plain, Swazi girls I'm repping for thee
Manenberg, Gugulethu; where you'd just be blessed to get through
For beauty shining through like the sun at the highest noon
From the top of the cable car at Table Mountain; I am you
Girls with the skyest blue of eyes and the darkest skin
For Cape Coloured for realizing we're African
For all my cousins back home, the strength of Mommy's backbone
The length of which she went for raising, sacrificing her own
The pain of not reflecting the range of our complexions
For rubber pellet scars on Auntie Elna's back, I march
Fist raised, caramel shining, in all our glory
For Mauritius, St. Helena; my blood is a million stories
Winnie for Joan and for Eadie, for Norma, Leslie, Ndidi
For Auntie Betty, for Melanie; all the same family
Fiona, Jo Burg, complex of mixed girls
For surviving through every lie they put into us now
This worlds yours', and I swear I will stand focused
Black girls, raise up your hands; the world should clap for us

Momma said they'll be days like this...
From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
In a state of grace
Where the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence
So the selling never safe
At the same time snitching to the Jake
Is the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake
But the problem we face seems so great
That we can't escape so we accept our fate
So the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint
If an artist is a part of a community
And got an opportunity to get that cake
Would never come back to the hood, no immunity
Usually a nigga like that so fake,no different from a snake
Nothing left to give cause you always wanna take
If you ain't using all the talents God provided you with
For the betterment of man, understand you ain't nothing but a waste
Look into the face of a young girl
Raising up like a flag when it's unfurled
Got game listening to her mother's pearls
And she love Beyonce cause she run the world
Her mama used to run this city
Way back before the nigga Puff was Diddy
When it came to the music then she got real picky
From New York, but preferred 2Pac over Biggie
No disrespect to Ms. Wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge
And she felt that Pac was more lyrical
Plus she never went to college
But she called herself 'Earth' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual
She God in the physical
And it's only natural to pray for a little you
Musical so she played the umbilical chords
So her daughter was born it was a miracle
Music is the light when it's dark
And the way that you spit your dart is a big part
She grew up loving hip hop
Now all her daughter got is "Love & Hip Hop"
Nowadays niggas turn up for the sex
Niggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement
Ratchet reality stars that be looking so stupid
Getting in the fights at reunions
She used to be inspired by the writers, now she's tired of the biters
No desire for the lying and the violence
That's inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment
Her body is politics
Lost count of how many whores she was called today
She won't do it no more, lost all her faith
They say she exaggerate when she hollerate
But it's only so much she can tolerate

Help me find my way to a state of grace
Stir my heart, touch my soul
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
Pull me to the grace

She wanna to be the first in her family with a higher education
Her entire graduation was a dire situation
Did a paper on the state of the hip hop generation
But no longer felt a part of the conversation
Used to be I'm a ''ride or die'' chick
B.I.G. with the ''Me And My Bitch''
No objections, being an object,major label seeing a profit
She ain't never been a bitch or a ho
But she used to sing along when she heard it in a song
She used to be front row at the shows 'til she overdosed on the testosterone
Her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed
But she felt like she really ain't belong
When she wouldn't let him hit, this nigga called her a bitch
She erased all her songs from the phone
You are who you fuck with, so the guy that she stuck with
You can bump it or dump it, the artist she trusted
Just broke her heart, so misogynistic and disgusting
She tried not to judge him, in her heart she still loved him
And the way that he lusting, a part of his suffering
And this young man, clearly not ready for the harder discussion
Female emcees acting more like a dude than a dude do, only if you knew
I know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo
But she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude
Taking cues from the radio playing that doodoo
She on D'Angelo Pandora station playing that Voodoo, who knew?


In the face of hate
She'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great
I see lyrics as colors and shapes
Put it on tape, let her know I could relate
When you wish you could switch the way that you look
And your nose was smaller and your hair was straight
When you got no faith
When you hate yourself, when you hate your race
Let's get to the core
Our sisters worth more than grinding on the wall half-naked
She a bitch, she a whore
And you rich and you shit on the poor
In all of your records and ask 'em to buy it
Why should I support music that constantly disrespects me?
And make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left
With the charge of repping it correctly
When it's free online or in a cloud
Ain't no reason to touch the radio dial
You wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air
And it's clear that your sales going down
Down by law then you found the raw
On a message board and you sounding off
These niggas get the whole world, but what's the cause?
No wonder why these niggas be sounding lost
Rhyming is a memory
The assembly line rap niggas is designed by the enemy
Stop giving them your soul, gift wrap
Prepackaged, fabricated shit rap
Running through you like fast food -  Big Mac's
You don't want no problems, fix that
All the time that you spent listening to that bullshit
Now you ain't never gon' get back


She don't love it, no
She don't love it no more
I exhibit characteristics of the average misfit
Who graduated from stabbing and grabbing a biscuit
It’s sick and tragic how antagonistic we get
When there's no power it go sour
I seen 'em crossing a bridge by the masses,
Covered in the ashes of both towers
Native New Yorker the way that we talk
Make him an offer that you can't refuse
Come back later on after you thought it over
Look out for shooters that we’re popping up at the opera
To pop ya, daughters paying for the sins of the god father
Popular music got ‘em confusing killers and artists
I kill it the hardest. Competition dearly departed
They feeling some sort of way 'cuz my flow revealing the garbage
I'm making 'em throw it up. You just making the people vomit
When it comes to this rhymin' I’m a legend like Tutankhamun,
Or the Chupacabra, the way I weave it together and tie the knot up
Made a macramé of macabre, you daquiri with a shot of
The Amarretta, you’re sweet as a girly drink
Throw it back, cognac, I'm the best, you know that
You can have your own opinion, but not your own facts
On track as the most prolific ever, the most consistently
Viciously off the rip, we be rippin' it like a shredder
Some symphony hall shit, gettin' higher than your falsetto,
Getting better. Drop a pearl every jam like Eddie Vedder
Very fed up with self appointed preservers of past eras
Who never see their reflection when they’re walking past mirrors
They got bitten and now they smitten with the taste of blood
They take enough drugs for the sleepin' they weepin' and fuckin' they make-up up
I raise the bar and the waiters up
All this hate is just confused unadulterated love
The eyes are the window to the souls and my shades is up
Advocate for artists, regardless cause I got faith in us
For the workers who don’t get paid enough
Take the bus, hands way too rough for the paper cuts
As far as they’re concerned food on the table's the only way to love
It takes a slum village to raise a child, you got to raise it up
Raise it up, raise it up,raise it up, take it up, take it up
Yes! Welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli
Ladies...

I got you in the mood, for an interlude
Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude
But let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview
I know you into me, so, let me get into you
I'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin
And rappin and fuckin', and passin' the dutch and relaxin'
And puffin' and hittin' and duckin', the rippin production
These kittens ain't muffins, just because we stuff 'em in the oven
My words is drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue
Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick
They holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady, but
One glimpse and I know they're ready, you already know
Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'
We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!

I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars (uh, uh)
Navigate through the truly bizarre (Yeezy, uh-uh)
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight (Woo!)

You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told you, oh
Lose, eat crews like crews like soul food
The only producer that feel like "fuck rappers!"
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers
Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker
So if he say nigga, then I'ma say...
Is this a Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like
Just like, I'm the shit
Uh, you ain't figured out what I'm about yet
Always rockin that "this ain't out yet," but this ain't 'bout that
From a city where niggas plug like outlets
Far as music go, yo, it ain't no outlets, so, when I go out
Niggas always out to get me in the studio
And I ain't in the mood to flow, I'm with my girl
And I'm tryin to hit the movies yo, and they tryna act stupid, oh!
In the club with Silicone Suzie
What happened to real girls like Rudy?
With real titties like Tootie
This girl got a silicon booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now I ain't tryin to judge like Judy
But bitch you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like 50, throw her in a pool, G!


Break it down, uh!
What?
Ah-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah
Ah-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah
Yeah!

Bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum
Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin our guns
Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun
Completely done with rap dudes, don't compete with the dumb
I spill my blood for my people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Donte and Main Flow
Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bojangles-ass dudes
Dancin around the club, doin the tango
Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles
Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!


Wow, that's a nice track!
(We must love and support each other!)
We have nothing to lose but our chains
(We have nothing to lose but our chains!)
Now you say that shit so loud, them motherfuckers outside hear you
It is our duty to fight for our freedom!
(It is our duty to fight for our freedom!)
It is our duty to win (It is our duty to win!)
We must love and support each other
(We must love and support each other!)
We have nothing to lose (We have nothing to lose!)
We have nothing to lose (We have nothing to lose!)
We have nothing to lose (We have nothing to lose!)
But our chains (But our chains!)

Send this one out to
To the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)
To the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
We send this one out to
To the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)
To the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
This is happening to all of us

Yeah, if our struggle is a strain then the strain is dominant
My name is prominent for entertainment that's laced with consciousness
But really it's just common sense like Lonnie Lynn
You don't need binoculars to see the light coming through the dome like it's an oculus
The common myth that we're savages with no history or accomplishments
Or knowledge of ourselves, they did a job on us
Considering the prediction of economists, machines will do our jobs for us
The future for the working class is ominous
They got us indoctrinated through a bitch's brew, a religion mixed in with abuse
Emotional we sit in pews, it's physical, we get the noose
And hang ourselves refusing to name ourselves, refuse to change ourselves
When I talk about our past it doesn't ring a bell
They make you hate yourself it take effort so check the method
They'll take you from your family, your kids will never respect ya
Attach your sins to the black of skin we get the message
We start acting if we cracking the whip better than the oppressor, yes
Every problem can't be solved at the ballot box
We unifying Africa like Gaddafi, that's what got Malcolm shot
They out to stop anybody with knowledge that figured out the plot
On the balcony like Martin Luther King, I been to the mountaintop
The blue wall of silence, it's really the blue wall of violence
The good cops who retire and get fired
They screaming black on black as an excuse for you to not care
'Til the cops roll up in their SWAT gear

I tarried through the turbulent month of Ramadan
Sweating all through the night just like the Holy Prophet
Then reappeared on the stage in BK with the Ummah
Shoulder to shoulder with J. Cole and Kweli
Just before Jehovah the God crowned me the king with his goldie locket
Alhamdulillah, we've come really far, ain't it?
The little engine who could, could power any car can't it?
The mothers in Chiraq say the murders getting burdensome
The cries of the despised was heard flying out of Ferguson
The last days and times, the holy Quran and Bible
We on the last page and line, the verse with all the babies dying
Outside of the matrix, inside of the spaceship but the savior's blind
Or so it seems, years after Noah was told he would row upstream
The heavens bursted and the rains came
Retaliation for the sons of the fathers who worked the chain gangs
I hit that shmoney dance on the coffin of a crooked cop
In a Worldstar society where all we do is look and watch
No intervention
Policemen beating elderly women with evil intentions on the highways and the byways
The police state be sprayed into the backstreet to the driveways
Officer friendly is an enemy now, looking at me sideways
Shit was all bad just a week ago
The view was just as sad just a peep ago
The cries of the asiatic ancient-semitic peoples
That propel Jay Elec from the pedestal to the steeple

To the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)
To the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
We send this one out to
To the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)
To the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
This is happening to all of us
To the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)
To the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
We send this one out to
To the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)
To the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
This is happening to all of us

We've got to live
Live to the end (we gotta do, we do)
We've got to live (for our grandmothers)
Live to the end (and granddaddies too)
We've got to live (live for the babies)
Live to the end (my brothers out there going crazy)
"Niggas is tellin' me about this Illuminati shit while I'm in jail - that's another way to keep your self-esteem low, that's another way to keep you unconfident. And I'm putting the 'K' cause I'm killing that Illuminati shit. Trust me. These motherfuckers wanted to kill you, why the fuck they gonna tell Farrakhan, why they gonna tell the Nation of Islam, why they gonna tell this nigga in jail about the plan? How did he know? How'd it leak to him? Who told him? Who told him, the Pope? Who? Cause they like, 'the Pope' and 'the money', aw c'mon man, get the fuck outta here."

Oh you niggas wanna get deep?
Niggas wanna kick knowledge?
Y'all niggas ain't deep man, y'all niggas lost me
Soon as you steady tryna tell me which rappers in the fuckin Illuminati
Then I'm like, show me the proof right?
Niggas start talking about the anti-Christ and aliens and shit
Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga, I'm a grown ass man
Let's go, let's go

You can lead a man to a drink
But you can't make him take a sip
You can lead a man to a link
But that don't mean he gonn' click
What's this? Y'all ain't really on no deep shit
I peeped it, scared of a motherfuckin' secret
Society and only bein' with people you agree with
You scared of a chalice scared of death
Only thing worse is your silence
Illuminatis enlightened, the OWL see in the darkness
Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
Egyptologist and scholars
Symbologists at the college
Will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started
Way farther back than the knights
Or the Rite of the Scottish
You need to wake up, no new Bugatti
My enemy tryna stop me but I don't stand a chance
If I can't identify 'em properly
Illuminati as we know it started in Bavaria
Years before it landed on the shores of America
The mission: abolishment of government and religion
They were enemys of the state
And they was hated by the Christians
They was Poets, they was Scholars
Early Illuminati was sorta like the students
In Victor Hugo's Les Miserables
The modern day politicians would diss 'em
Turning them into martyrs
This in turn inspired the founding fathers
The vast majority Masons who were the subject of the Illuminati
Found this fascination the order was insipiration
And ain't no disrespect to the masons
But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
Only those in league with Satan need to hide infomation
That's how you catch a ride to your final destination
Where the proof, show 'em proof put it all on the table
When the facts are intact ain't no need for a fable
Good versus evil is primitive
Real life's more complex, what's your context?
They put the symbols on the dollar bill, the monument, the obelisk
They honouring Columbia the children of the colonists
You can trace it back to the root trace it back again
It's really just another case of stealin' from the African
Racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh
You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh?
Population control is real, you know the deal
But still perpetuate the cycle of violence
We known to hold the steel
No, I don't need no fuckin' chorus
Used to read so many books
Thought I was a hoarder down at Borders
Like Behold the Pale Horse or The New World Order
But you really don't know what you reading
If you really don't know the author
A lot of Satan worship is just government propaganda
Unsubstantiated lies with no proof a bunch of slander
Of course there are forces against you and that's a fact
Don't get caught in the distraction, it's bigger than any rapper
The truly oppressed ain't got the luxury of inventing a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
What they doing so sinister
Worse than any blood sacrifice you can imagine
Iller than any cinema
The Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the IMF
Helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath
Food, vaccines, humanitarian aid
They want control of the region, they really tryna get paid
Obey thy consumer make a product out of man
Where's the conspiracy? It's always been the plan
Y'all niggas scared of one world currency
But still paying your taxes
It ain't the Illuminati that worry me
Lack of spiritual energy, suicidal tendencies
Unwitting soldiers in the armies of the enemy
I'm leaking information so follow me down the wormhole
Same reason that they called Bradley Manning a turncoat

(Man, we supposed to be brothas!)
Oh what you tryna get smart?
Nigga you tryna kick some knowledge?
Nigga fuck that give me your muthafuckin jewelry nigga
Take that shit off
Oh you got a pager too huh?
You a balla huh? You a balla huh?
Gimme that muthafuckin' shit
Better me than the muthafuckin cops nigga
This is a tear jerker

The revolution's here
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh

Yo, I heard it's said the revolution won't be televised
But in the land of milk and honey there's a date you gotta sell it by
Otherwise it just expires and spoils
And these folks jump out the pot when the water too hot
Cause the fire boils inside
You go to church to find you some religion
And all you hear is connivin' and gossip and contradiction and
You try to vote and participate in the government
And the muh'fuckin' Democrats is actin' like Republicans
You join a organization that know black history
But ask them how they plan to make money and it's a mystery
Lookin' for the remedy but you can't see what's hurtin' you
The revolution's here, the revolution is personal
They call me the political rapper
Even after I tell 'em I don't fuck with politics
I don't even follow it
I'm on some KRS, Ice Cube, Chris Wallace shit
Main Source, De La Soul, bumpin' "2Pacalypse Now"


Yo, I speak at schools a lot cause they say I'm intelligent
No, it's cause I'm dope, if I was whack I'd be irrelevant
I'm like the dope in your tracks until your high is settled in
You leanin' to the left, the laughter's the best medicine
But the troubles you have today you just can't laugh away
Stay optimistic, thinking change is gonna come like Donny Hathaway
You have to pray, on top of that, act today
Cause opportunity shrivel away like Tom Hanks in "Cast Away"
Everybody pass away, the pastor prays, the family mournin'
Everybody act accordin' to the season that they born in (You'll try to change the world)
You fight in the streets, start bleedin' 'til the blood is pourin'
In the gutter, mothers cry 'til the Lord be livin' by the sword and
All that folks want is safety, they goin' gun crazy
The same reason Reagan was playin' war games in the '80s
The same reason I always rock dog chains on my babies
The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery


It's a beautiful thing that's happenin' right now
Right now G
Yo, I'm rockin' with my man Hi-Tek on the track right now
We fightin' the good fight
The Beautiful Struggle
Yeah, let's go
(So please excuse me while I laugh)
Uh uh, yea yea uh uh
Turn the music up, uh uh
Yea yea, yea yea, yea yea
Okay okay, we almost there
Let's go let's go, uh uh
Yea yea, yea yea, yeah, yeah, yeah

É tudo nosso
Conexão Brasil, Estados Unidos
É pra chapar rapá...
Eu tenho o prazer de dizer que tou ahhh
Aqui agora para cantar para você, para balançar
Se voce quiser, pode chegar, pode dancar
Ohhhhhhhh

Last night I had a dream that was so real
I woke up in a cold sweat, it felt so ill
I stared into the face of an angel
Tainted by the city, you ain't from this place it'll change you
Walkin by, I thought I was sly
Offered to try, at first I thought she was shy
'Til I saw this guy at the bar talkin to her reckless
She ignored him, cast a glance in my direction, started dancin to my section
... Her body flyer than a jet pilot
What a smile and the eyes like wet violets
They flutter by like the wings of the butterfly
Keep it tight, Eva Mendes in The Other Guys
Got me in another zone - they call her Sunshine like
"Put your mother on the phone, I ain't comin home"
Put a deposit on a place in her heart
All along she a place from the start
My favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I, man I fell in love
Man I, man I, uh

Ehhhh, a gente é desse jeito mesmo é diferente
Ehhhh, é brasileiro é swingueiro, é coração
Ehhhh, a gente é que bota fé na vida pode cre
Tamo ai para viver para encarar
(Ehhh) A vida pro que der e vier
É nois que tá na fita agora pode crê
Brasil crescendo a gente tá ai para aparecer
Se voce quiser colar com a gente, não tem nada não
A gente vai correndo junto nessa mesma união
Brasil o povo de mistura raca pé no chão
Objectividade na vontade de crescer

A feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet
Yet my words are slow dancin, my language is romantic
Vocabulary that's bustin your capillaries
My freedom'll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries
My adversaries speak I'll of my name, I'm so sick
Attack is very guerilla, my game is so pimp
Everything fall into place, it's gravitational
Profit stay in the black, the shade is so un-fadeable
Healthy relationship make your other ones better
I'm Lee Scratch Perry, they call me the upsetter
For the cheddar get the bread up
Mr. International call it the bruschetta, the spiritual newsletter
I wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part
You're lookin into my heart or just lookin to be a part
From a boss in my prime, look how we crossin the finish line
How you tired, I stay wired like I was offered a line


Uh, uh
I don't wanna bang it or beat it, hit it or stab it
You're listenin to voodoo, I call it the black magic
You jammin up the traffic, you bubble, it don't stop
It might blow up but it won't go pop
"Pow!" That's the sound like onomatopoeia
Got me floatin when you (Rockin My Boat) like you Aaliyah
Got them African features like people out in Bahia
Mix tobacco with the reefer like you was a European
When I leave I'm gonna miss you, (Official) like Kardinal
Trust I'll come back and I'll visit for carni-val
When I come back around, take me out on the town
And you can show me how you put it down
My favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I, man I fell in love
Man I, yea, yea yea...
Ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard
We tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods
Precious metals round our necks and arms
We tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods

Whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look it's never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
I've been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto

Black magic in the hood, it's tragic but understood
Crack addicts, crack windows, crack wood
Even what's bad becomes good, status becomes stood
Upon the pedestal welcome to the ghetto show
Federal buildings, pissy hallways filled with children pushing children
Fiends lips peeling, shit seems real and
What's real is the estate of mind that we're in
The situation feels great
My man peels weight, so he can fill plates
You might get love but you still feel hate
With gang shakes and chain clinks, we communicate
Chicago to Brooklyn nigga real ones do relate

If lyrics sold, then truth be told
I'd probably be just as rich and famous as Jay-Z
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like common sense
Next best thing I do a record with Common Sense
Cause it's the music, the blues, it's the jazz, it's acoustics
Soul, Rock and Roll, the hip-hop that we producin', yea
It's the gear, it's the flare, it's the stare
Nowadays they'll shoot you where they used to shoot the fair
Remember lost soldiers, pour a beer, shoot the air
We got our own elected officials, no matter who the mayor
I know you know what I'm talking about
From New York to the South, take off your shoes when you walk in the house


Yo, I grew up where they're playin' skelly in the parking lot
And sell paintings of Aaliyah, B.I.G. and Pac up in the barbershop
Buildings too big so you don't really see the stars a lot
But rappin', drinkin', and goin' to prison you see them bars a lot
I feel the spirit in the dark and hear it in my heart
And always keep my ears to the block till I dearly depart
Hip-hop is really the art
We have to express the part of ourselves that make us want to martyr ourselves
It ain't harder to tell when somebody stick you up and put the hammer to you
They want them dead presidents like stic.man and Mutulu
With a gun to your jaw, these kids don't run anymore
Kicks is a hundred or more

A man in front of the store, beggin' for money and mercy
I told him say a prayer under his breath, he cursed me
Niggas is thirsty I heard it's a drought
Up early, servin' from their grandmother's house
Sometimes the ghetto feels desolate, the eyes of the hood yo is desperate
Affected by the deficit, times and lessons get hard
Either get by or get God, but you try to get by
It's like the block keep blockin'
You try to make moves, its like the car keep stoppin'
These shorties in the court, need Cochran yea
I tell them while the weed seeds poppin', in the game you need options
No time for feet watchin', me and Kwe keep rockin' for the ghetto
That is great, good for you
Okay get out of the way though
Thank you, excuse me, excuse me

Been a long time, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Say uhh, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, say
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
C’mon, the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yeah, y’know you heard of that
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
You know the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yes, I know you heard of that

Psychopath, ride a tricycle in a biker’s club
Mike Tyson face tatted, addict like it rough
Hey scatterbrain, don’t get your grey matter punched up
Til you're hunched, tucked, talking like you punch drunk
One love, two maybe if I’m drunk enough
Naked watching three painted ladies do the bump and rub
Mean mugging Jean the Heebs call meshugenah
Booking her in the Catskills like, look at her rap skills
E-book in the backpack, the nerd in the Rat Pack
Jean Martin de Bergerac, you heard of her murder rap
Her murder rep, then learn it, confirm it and burn its audio
Music for your convertible, use it for burning cardio
Don’t use it with burners, they’ll find me in your stereo
And blame me for the murders, lock me up and get me carried off
I know I said murder before murder murder, fuck it, murder
Make it four, insert a learning curve
Mine is so high you get vertigo, assertive girl, infernal glow
Eternally superlative, blindfolded learn to drive
At night up on a girder bridge, hurt her no
Tyler Durden nerve in this, the boys are back
Oh yes the boys in black, the boy’s a {Black Star}, rap star
Jean a rock star, minus the Pharrell and all the cop cars
Rock soft, lock bars with the realest in the spot
Really y’all should get on your knees and pray us for our forgiveness, say


I’m a man of God who asked the Devil for some face time
The Shaitan, you never see him coming cause you're faith blind
The mainline, Bloods is waving flags like K’Naan
The Crips throwing gang signs
The Beast in the street bear they teeth like a canine
Get low like the bassline
Jean and Kwa think alike like great minds
The crown is on my head, what makes you think that you can take mine
They know they’ll never win but still they racist like a hate crime
Run the track like Tyra in Higher Learning
We bleeding gasoline so we keeping the fire burning
We speeding like Valvoline and we speak for a higher purpose
You believe in magazines, I deliver entire sermons
You need some Vaseline cause your shit is dryer than deserts
You never fired a weapon in your life so
Picturing yourself as a gangster the only way that you shooting
My intelligent design is a product of evolution
Psychotic, erotic catch phrases just to get at your girl
Create solutions for a digital world
So baby even when I’m spitting game I’m adding on
Rappers going hard, the G.O.A.T
I got an acronym for Capricorn
Centered And Prepared, Rigorous, Innovative
Captivating, Ordinary, Regular, Nigga just
Growing daily, your chick goin crazy yo
Handle her like Chelsea Lately
Rocking the fresh kicks like you felt the baby
We’ll wait til you done being whack
We got every hand up from the front to the back
If you wondering why dudes is dressing funny in rap
They need attention dog, there ain’t no more money in rap
So if you mixing with GarageBand, videos on the Flip cam
I’m a big fan, you got more heart than Bret The Hit Man
But shit damn, it’s the pinnacle, gets no better
I’m boasting, but still stay humble
Never cynical, I’m posting
Yeah
Yo...let me, let me, let me, let me tell you why - why
This nigga...why we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga
Cuz number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects
With a - with a Sebring, and with - with a rag off
Y'na'mean? Y-you not ballin' like that play-boy
Straight up, then the bitch you got playin' shotgun
Like, I used to serve that bitch, c'mon
Really really good, I mean and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack ass nigga...

Wack niggas...I don't even like to be around 'em
Give 'em dap or pound 'em
See 'em out, they houndin' dawg
Sayin' they got tracks for me to get down on
Sayin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm
Nigga I'm nasty, my style is sound porn
The graphic, exposin' wack asses
I emcee as free as Ol' Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin' to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldn't be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K

The pastor say we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack 'n' eh
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Y'see the whiskay had them girls feelin' friskay
You was with mey, she said "Who's the sissay?"
And even if they did wanna get bizzay
Freaky like Missay and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you would fuck up a free lunch, dawg
Just keep it right thurr like Chingay
Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gay
Spanish girls tell ya "No hable ingle"
And everbody wanna run to me for they single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you I'd kill myself

(Wack nigga) Wake up in the morning dawg, and you a
(Wack nigga) I'd kill myself if I was that
(Wack nigga) Everything you wear and rock, is just
(Wack nigga) Even if you flossin' rocks you still
(Wack nigga) You can't do it dawg, you's a
(Wack nigga) Bitin' ass, bitch ass, trick ass
(Wack nigga) Even your daughter says "My daddy's a - "
(Wack nigga - You wack nigga!)

You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you
That's how you know ya flow is weak
Cuz you only got them there to 'Say Yes' like Floetry
The clique that I oversee ain't impressed by ya poetry
You're the place you're supposed to be
You ain't ain't comin' close to me
It ain't that you underrated
It's more that you're under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldn't get the clearances
For them it's just a check they don't respect you as a lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is, Murder, Death, Kill
But you never shot nothin', never have, never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees that'll add to ya problems

In the beginnin', God created man in his own image
I'm 'bout to tell you how the story gon' finish
Kweli handle his business, niggas don't forget it
Cause a wiseman can choose to get ignorant with it
Na'mean - you all can get it, I'm conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
All day talkin' that shit like, "You hold a gat, right?"
The trip you on must be short cause you pack light - act right
You got it twisted, tellin' niggas that you pack heat
You ain't gunning now, you runnin' like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen Ive
Start speakin' Nuwaubian and followin' Malachi
Or anything but rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
All these thug niggas wanna rap
And all these rap niggas wanna thug
And all ya'll fuckin' the game up
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'mma bout to meet my quota, you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got boy!
Not that I'm wildin' or even promote violence
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?!
Yeah
Yeah! That's what I'm talkin about!
Let's do it... Kanye West, c'mon turn me up and
Black Thought, c'mon turn me up and
Pharoahe Monch, c'mon turn me up and
Talib Kweli in the house with

Guerrilla Monsoon rap - all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat

Yo, I hit these emcees with the grip of death like I was a Vulcan
Ain't a lot of "ifs" an "ands", it's just straight talkin
It's hard to swallow at times, so take portions
Bitin off more than you can chew, create orphans
Emcee species endangered like dolphins
Rappers is spittin nails into they own coffins (c'mon)
Hear come the Dundee moves rocket-launchin (yeah)
Black Thought, quit playin him close and back up off him

Kweli -- spruce to the tree, Bruce to the Lee
The real emcee, that your favorite rapper used to be
One by one I knock 'em out like Schoolly D - my rhymes is eulogy
A flea could move a tree, before ya think ya movin me
I black and blue emcees - actin new to me, get smacked stupidly
They lack skills, like the black community lack unity (uh)
Still my rhymes hurt like Ali to Fraiz'
Step off the stage to shouts of "Kweli boomayyay!!"

See these four emcees came to get down
Rearrange the rap game, change ya whole sound
Nigga YOU, got ta, understand the plot ta
Movin and groovin and always improvin alot-ta
I'll outfox the, average Porsche Boxster talk
Break the bank on some old Frank Sinatra (New York...)
Slash Chi-Town, slash Philly
Check the blast from Geneva, you can get slapped silly


Okay... my sound drenches, each of the five senses
And hold the shock value of electrified fences
It's truth or consequences, ride wit us or against us
Is you a dedicated soldier, or you a princess, dog?
I'm in it to win it and not for the wealth
Got a crib with a Grammy and a gat on the shelf
Nan nigga competition, gotta battle myself
And me and Kweli on a mission, gettin Pharoahe for help

From natives walkin the Trail of Tears to players sippin Belvedere
We always comin well prepared, and all my dogs' smellin fear
PLUS, even my niggas from the Bay, they say you hella scared
Truth or consequences, and all senses be well-aware
Your style - under-developed there, hell if I care
What hardship you claim to see, but I can tell by your stare
Nigga you fugazi, sayin ya crew blazin
Like sayin Miss Cleo is a true Jamaican, we makin

Guerrilla Monsoon rap, smell the fumes, get in tune wit it
When I attack your city, y'all gon' think Dr. Doom did it
Spit it like white trash in seed-spittin contests
With a vendetta that sent a betta letter bomb to Congress
I'm pissed - cumulus clouds of ominous
Words of the Thor, the rawness that'll restore ya calmness
Unless, you wanna be leg and armless
That's parapaleg' for those who believe in bomb threats
I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

K. West! Kweli!
Got searched on the plane, Arabic first name
Disturbed by the fame just like Kurt Cobain
Breath of life, kiss of death, my lips pursed the same
You flirt 'til she came
Nothin' hurt like the pain and torture
Daughters of the dust lookin' for a vein
Something to take in vain like the Lord's name
Put your hands together, got 'em all sayin'

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Yo, it's all ghetto in gear higher than falsetto
More metal for beef that we don't let the law settle
I try to navigate the treacherous waters of
America's ghettos that set up to slaughter us
But there's more of us
Although we speak in different languages
We all pretty familiar with what anger is
Young and dangerous, trigger stranglers
Get up on some gangsta shit
Guns to bang ya wit'
And we put it on records to entertain ya wit'
Our growing pains go way deeper than Mike Seaver's
Our uniforms is white sneakers and white T-shirts
On top of wife beaters
We like to light reefers
The 'hood need us for rappers, just ain't the right leaders
I put a lot into it
This is my product and I gotta move it
Stop the industry but you can't stop the music

An upside down kingdom where life is just not fair (upside down kingdom)
Some many sufferin' cuz deep inside they're scared (so scared)
Fear pumped into their veins to keep them from their destiny
Where would they be if you and I don't care?

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Yo, the things I'm seein' on the news is insane
A stock broker shoot his kid and throw himself in front of a train
A mother leave her baby home for two weeks all by himself
Three years old, eatin' ketchup and mustard, cryin for help
Tryin' to bring your struggle to life
The label want a song about a bubbly life
I have trouble tryin' to write some shit
To BANG in the club through the night
When people suffer tonight
Lord knows I try

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Life is a beautiful struggle
People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
Some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle
Some people put it all together, make it fit like a puzzle
Come on, say it now
Life is a beautiful struggle
People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
Some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle
Some people put it all together, yeah

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try
Upside down kingdom
Oh, they're so scared
Everyday on the news we can't look around with
Something somewhere
I try, I try, you know I try
I try, I try, I try, you know I try
Lord knows, Lord knows we try
Yeah
Yeah man
So I start looking out the window
I see gun store, gun store, liquor store, gun store
Where the fuck are you taking me?

We bout to twist it up
We bout to lift it up
We never givin' up
The startin' salary, it's hard reality
Find solidarity
We got our leaders too but where they lead us ?
Do they leave us or they see it through?
Yeah we packin' precious metals
Our shit is next level
We raise the threat level

Every ghetto, every city, like Ms. Hill
They way too used to the missed meals
Hard to concentrate, hard to sit still
Murder rate permanent place in the top 10
We live here, these hipsters drop in
You hear them barrels cockin'
They say consciousness mean a nigga ain't rugged
Until they get beat within an inch of it
Self made niggas don't get discovered
They actin' like you owe 'em somethin'
Homie I don't owe you nothin'
Fuck your beef
It's way too early in the mornin' for the hate
You ain't brushed your teeth yet nigga
And your toast ain't buttered
A perfect storm and the coast is flooded
Most discovered that my flow got 'em
You posers sound like  stuttered
Man I'm goin' too fast, let me slow it down

I'm good walkin' in every ghetto around the world
The hood often embrace ya when you profound with words
I say the shit they relate to, I keep it down to Earth
Other rappers sound like they hate you, them niggas sound absurd
So when they walk through the ghetto they get their chain snatched
They gotta talk to the ghetto to get their chain back
It's like an open air prison and it remain packed
Nothin' but straight facts

Indie 5, for the people by the people
Ya-ya, giddy up, who got the juice now?
Snatch it out your kiddies cups
The shit you gave us watered down
This one's for Basquiat
They be brushin' with death, uh
Is this The Art Of War for cops?
We double-dutchin' duckin' shots
Every home ain't got a Pops
Every man ain't sellin' rocks
A different will to win here
Different from switchin' cars
They pray that we switch our bars
To a fiend from a metaphor
Worldstar, Worldstar
Lotta love and this life hard
Keep us prayin' like "oh God"
Illegally thievery think us peelin' off easily
Frustrated we hate it
That's why we scream out "nigga we made it"
It's an odd future they ain't know we was all some creators
Somethin' from nothin' was told Kings walk and man you frontin'
For the people and by the people but them over money
I'm on my Viola Davis here, workin' for justice
How you get away with murder? Be a cop and just kill us
How we supposed to not catch feelings?
Innocent lives, boy we got kids in these buildings
I'm on my Viola Davis, it's what you call a defense
For all the drama they gave us I'm spittin' Shonda Rhimes wit
Too high for you like ganja, that’s what Shonda rhyme with
I holla back in the Hamptons, you still black if you rich
Spread love ain't just the Brooklyn way, it's universal
360 and the nine lives, whoa, what a circle

We bout to live it up
We bout to give it up
We bout to twist it up
The startin' salary, it's hard reality
Find solidarity
We got our leaders too but do they leave us?
Or they lead us and they see it through?
Ready or not

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (word)

Every Sunday dressing up catching gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all God's children, then what's the word of the reverend worth?
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in God's image, then that means his face is mine
Wait or it's that blasphemy it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father, then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally that's confusion to a young'n tryna follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus, then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
Who was King James? And why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible?
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say that's where you go when you die
But how they know?

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)

I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons, it was a blessing, not a curse
I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth, word
Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and that's where them crazy baldheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
That's why when they say one is right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that ain't vein to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognizing that life is full of miracles
You could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who looking for God knowin' to go inside

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup)

Living in mass confusion, looking for absolution
The gas seducin' and psychopath produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satan
Religion create division, make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew, make the rules of faith
That you condition to and to you gotta follow
And God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well

Momma say it's her after me
Preacher say it's blasphemy
I say there's gotta be a better explanation
This dance is just me and you
I pray to God, here's you
Take one look at your rear view
And you can see what I see
That could only mean

We know (hey)
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell

The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Just because the lord is my shepherd don't mean I gotta be no sheep
You feel me?
More blood is spilled over religion than anything in world history
We saying the same thing
.
Yeah
Special dedication
I'm sendin' this one out to you
And you and you and you
I said to you and you and you

She cold blooded
I love how we meltin' the ice
She like the sunshine of my life
Cause all I see is a hot thing
You're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, you keep my dark sky lit up at night
So bright that you blinding my sight
Cause all I see is a hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, somebody like a flick
It got surprisin' twists
I write the script
The main character - your thighs and hips
Award for best supportin' role go to your eyes and lips
The way you move your body got 'em stiff like a hieroglyph
I watched you dance across the floor to the title track
You 'bout to get me "Off The Wall" like you Michael Jack'
I make a scribe in your beauty my sacred duty
I will write a song, write a book, write a play, make a movie

Good love you a sexy thing
And all I'm sayin' is you got somethin' I like
Love that you like it
Love that you like it
Love that you like it

Yo, I love your country ass
I love your city sass
I love how you know my ways
You catch on pretty fast
These dudes are pretty crass
Harass you in your past
I love how you snap back and get the last laugh
I love the way your crib smell like Votivo candle incense
The White voice you use on the phone when you handle business
I love it when you freaky
I love when you a lady
Rockin' door knockers from the late 80s, raisin' babies
I love her; god bless you
Your body somethin' special
I love to play connect the dots with your facial freckles
No need for fashion policin' because I love your style
Whatever happen to Shenice, baby I love your smile
I might be fallin' in love, should I let her know
A pimp told me if I love her I should let her go
I sing her praises every time they play this instrumental
Cause she instrumental to my life


I love how we meltin' the ice
You like the sunshine of my life
Cause all I see is a hot thing
You're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, you keep my dark sky lit up at night
So bright that you blinding my sight
Cause all I see is a hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, lemme take you by the hand
You need to tell your man, don't fight it, damn
Have you groupied out like excited fans
I promise you'll be climbing walls like Spider-Man
Knees bucklin' you'll hit the floor when you try to stand (up)
So you drop it like it's hot - oh so heavy
You and me we can leave now - we can go steady
How about we be jetty cause I'm so ready to bounce like a '64 Chevy
Girl you're outstanding
From your hips to your thighs
It's  how you standing out
Girl you're outstanding
So let's not waste no time
Let's get it girl cause tonight it's ours, yeah

While you walking, everybody watching you closely
Hitting them high notes, nothing about you low key
Just let it register, body is unreal
Was animated like Jessica...
Rabbit a cartoon, wanna stab like a harpoon
These dudes is dry; the club a desert
Your body like an oasis
The thirst is so real, you can see it all in they faces
Especially when you drop it low, baby you gotta know
Girl you be killing them, filling them with all kind of hope
Dude on the block that be selling dope
By the shoes and the watch you can tell he's broke
Tell him stop with the lies he telling folks, you can't see with a telescope
Celebrating, holding glasses up like Sara Palin nose
Love it in the club when the fellows go
But you hate that your hair gotta smell like smoke
They ask you what is hitting for
Nigga try to fix the prices, never dealt with chicks before
You ain't got your liquor license, still you down to live your life
If dude is down to split the slice of pie... you like the master active fly
Until you hit it right
Hey you girl with the tight up-skirt
In the back of the club where they light up purp'
Known to drop it like a stripper, with her night off work
They make it rain and you stuffing dollars right in your, purse


You just looking for somebody that can fill in the spot
Fill in the blank, yeah shorty, you've been sipping a lot
Feeling the drink, as it seeps to your head
You erase your regrets
Throw another shot back, as you race to forget
Yeah the night just started, we both parted from ex love
Sleep won't make you forget him baby but sex does
Swear you ain't looking for no one night stand
But you prepared to risk it all for that one right man
Ask me, let's have a toast to your future
I know you belong to
Leave your ex in the past, don't let him haunt you
The last argument was world war III, but follow me
I introduce you to that bourgeoisie
Talk is cheap, welcome to the R. Les show
You'll be my Brigitte Bardot, I'll be your Serge Gainsbourg
Give you what you came for, let me get that car door
Have you ever made love in the Lambo Gallardo
I come from the God body era
I come from standing on street corners
Smoking blunts out of white owls with 40s
Building and destroying about the suns
And the planets and the moons and the stars
About the nature of man
About knowledge, wisdom, and understanding
And you had to show and prove
And you had to be right and exact

Voulez-vous, rendezvous, coucou le poopoo, come on!
Yeah Chris, yeah, I like that right there, yeah!
Hah, come on! Yeah
KAYTRANADA, classic

Waste these niggas, son, I got a doctorate in rockin it
Pardon, we got it poppin, it's marvelous, nigga watch it
You follow a carbon copies I'm stoppin' to intervene
You're erroneous, these the phoniest rappers I've ever seen
When I take flight, I'm traveling light, that's a double entendre
For when I'm touring, exploring outside the genre
Illuminate, when I grabbin the mic, it's so bright it'll blind you
Yeah I'm back with a friendly reminder
We're two ships that're passing in the night, but alas
You got to run into the iceberg, I'm cracking this shit in half
Traveling light, not talking about back of the back
First I get back in the lab, then I hit the road, I'll be back in a flash
I'm Barry Allen mixed with Harry Allen
My blood hot as volcanic rock forming canary diamonds they find on Canary Islands
My rhymes inspired by enviroments of the very violent
I'm the voice of a generation that's very silent
I stick to my convictions like I've been indicted
All you niggas throwing me shade you about to get enlightened

Travel light, travel light
Traveling light, travel light
You grinding 'til the sun up
Whether it's cold murder, the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles, just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh, rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die, so
Brooklyn is changing, and so am I
I see you on the other side, travel light

Ay, I'm faster than the speed of sound
Smashing through these barriers, I'm blasting out your speakers now
Travel around the planet till I landin where I'm needed now
We entertainers, they wanna call us leaders now
Woah, extra baggage not in the plans, I'll shop when I land
Stop for the fans, every airport from Okinawa to Osaka, Japan
Stop assuming I live in your time zone
Jetlag is my reality, the road is my home, I roam
Your downfall is you should probably get out more
I been planning out tours, with a band of outlaws
I'm packing my bags, just marijuana and magazines
Wrapping the flag around a pistol, the red, the black and the green
Never crashing, the grill is mean when I'm whipping machines
Dipping between all these commuters, they moving slow like they sippin the lean
Are they living the dream? Get to they office
And that computer's drifting off until they spit start to drip from the screen

Travel light, travel light
Traveling light, travel light
You grinding 'til the sun up
Whether it's cold murder, the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles, just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh, rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die, so
Brooklyn is changing, and so am I
I see you on the other side, travel light

City of broken promises, my mission is reconnaissance
It's dangerous for anybody following
That's why I take biting as a compliment, it's proof of my dominance
It's the haters' way of congratulating me for my accomplishments
Well, I'm so atop of this demolishing all the Charlotters
To whisper in the ears of your congressmen
Shoving dollars in their pockets, the more we locked up, the more they profiting
They building empires like Ottoman
Now who you wanna face? The sharks in the water or the snakes in the boat?
The lesser of two evils be fighting for fake votes
We walking through the valley of darkness so stay close
Need the light at the end of the tunnel to make a toast
Raise a glass to our glorious past, we the wave of the future
Never confusing protesters for looters
Silencing Radioheads and OK Computers
Travel to Mecca like Mansa Musa so let's go
(Yeah!)
The proud. Stand tall or don't stand at all, come on. Uhh, yeah. Break it down. What we do?

We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

June 11, 2001. Timothy McVeigh is executed and the country breathe a sigh of relief. Goodness prevails over evil, it seems. Somehow when he's gone, we feel safer. Little do we know

Today the paper say Timothy McVeigh's in hell
So everything's okay and all must be well
I remember Oklahoma when they put out the blaze
And put Islamic terrorist bombing, on the front page
It's like saying only gays get AIDS, propaganda
Like saying the problem's over when they locked that man up
Wrong! It's just the beginning, the first inning
Battle for America's soul, the devil's winning
The President is Bush, the Vice President's a Dick
So a whole lot of fucking is what we gon' get
They don't wanna raise the babies, so the election is fixed
That's why we don't be fucking with politics
They bet on that, parents fought and got wet for that
Hosed down, bit by dogs, and got blacks into house arrest for that
It's all good except for that, we still poor
Money, power and respect is what we kill for, for real

It's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

August 4, 2001. A drunken police officer mows down an entire family in Brooklyn. The judge lets him go with no bail. It reminds us, of just how worthless our lives are to the justice system. I struggle, to explain the situation to my son, it's hard

Niggas with knowledge is more dangerous than than niggas with guns
They make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggas dumb
Target the gangs and graffiti with the Prop 21
I already know the deal, but what the fuck do I tell my son?
I want him living right, living good, respect the rules
He's five years old and he still thinking cops is cool
How do I break the news that when he gets some size
He'll be perceived as a threat or see the fear in they eyes
It's in they job description to terminate the threat
So 41 shots to the body is what he can expect
The precedent is set, don't matter if he follow the law
I know I'll give my son pride and make him swallow it all (Damn!)
Fuck the pigs! I think the pigs killed Big and 'Pac too
If they didn't they know who did, they got to!
Who they serve and protect, nigga not you
Cops shot off of ten G's, but they got Glocks too
Let you protect yourself, or better yet respect yourself
Straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
They be getting tips from snitches and rival crews
Doing them favors, so they working for the drug dealers too
Just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
Shoot you in the back, won't face you like a soldier
Kurt Loder asked me what I say to a dead cop's wife
Cops kill my people everyday, that's life

We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

September 11, 2001. Terrorists attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center kills thousands and permanently scars America's false sense of security. We see the best examples of humanity in the face of the worst. As firefighters, police officers, rescue workers and volunteers of all sorts, fight to save lives. The world will never be the same again

My heart go out to everybody at Ground Zero
Red, black, yellow, white and brown heroes
It's more complicated than black and white
To give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
But it's hard for me to walk down the block
Seeing rats and roaches, crack viles and 40 ounce posters
People broken down from years of oppression
Become patriots when they way of life is threatened
It's a hard conversation to have
We lost kids, moms and dads, people ready to fight for the flag
Damn, when did shit get this bad?
America kill the innocent too, the cycle of violence is sad
Damn! Welcome to the world, we here
We've been at, war for years but it's much more clear
We got to face what lies ahead
Fight for our truth and freedom and, ride for the dead

We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
Let's toast to paid mortgages, lasting marriages
Tina Farris's pay King to Paris
Living long, making my kids heirs and heiresses
The family crest, the legacy, the heritage
I'm out of Philly where the ecstasy and syrup is
And we don't need Theraflu, we need therapists
Them never-ending pursuit of them dead presidents
Is the reason I got the band back together, bitch
Yeah, it's me and 
North side, bomb squad, Eric Vietnam
If you don't see it like I see it then you see it wrong
We October 3rd niggas like me and Kwe'
Life got me in a state on the interstate
And all I'm thinking bout is what's up on my dinner plate
Meanwhile I make your girls hyperventilate
Prolly cause I live the kind of life art imitate

That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands
We living next door to the Aquilius again
Pardon me fam
But I'mma show you how it is
I'mma show you how we get in

Rocking the Guy Fawkes mask like Anonymous
Passport pimping like I'm going outta town to flip
The ass for a symbol with the cops hopping out of whips
Bath salt niggas with the zombies apocalypse
I'm blessed cause my afterlife is the studio
This rappers life is gangster's paradise like I'm Coolio
That's what a few believe like a doobie roll
We off of that Patrón, we sipping the Don Julio
You talking shit? we don't need the chatter
Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth
That's when I'm letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out
Better let it off cause you set it off
The music that's creating a movement like it's December 4th
Threw away the dark meat but they ate the white
Animated like it's kind of darklit it's my wicked life
It imitate my life


Yeah, y'all keeping it 3hunnid, we keeping it 360
Coming full circle echelon don emcees with me
Tired of saying I'm the best, I won't waste another breath
Heard lyrics coming back, I say it never left
Y'all just catching up, so slow to come around
Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down
Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it, and set the precedence
And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff
Nice being self employed, ain't gotta kiss ass
I ain't gotta slim fast, smack a ho with a love handle
Dare you to say you ain't a fan boo, roll a bamboo
Life imitating art imitating life, show you how the fam do
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money

I used to put the money first, y'all still do
But that hardly works cause y'all still ask for prices from
The waiters and you're hardly served
You pay once, you pay forever, that you can't reverse
That's why I ain't paid Talib for no fuckin' verse
Mutual respect over below payments
Your mind accepted marriage when money proposed slavery
I been listenin' and four quarters of y'all won't make it
I'm Africa's number one, that's a fuckin' bold statement
And I'm the most relevant
You failin' to admit that is your biggest impediment
We're not on the same level man
Your dream girl sent me nudes and I'm checkin' 'em
Underneath the table as I'm havin' dinner with the president
Man fuck the money
O tsenya tlhogo then otla ka plane
Eh sane, being broke's for makgokgorane
They love cause they know I'm bein' real to my peeps
There's niggas richer than me who still wish they were me
Wassup

Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money

Money make niggas break promises
Money turn niggas into pharmacists
Money make you drop outta colleges
But the bars that I spit through God exist
Who we be, that's who we are
Versace, Gucci, Louis Vuitton
My taste expensive as a superstar
So I take what I want like a coup d'état
From profit sharing to profiteering
Now they stop and stare cause we cop McLarens
But we not preparing for God's appearance
Too busy dominating and domineering
Our competition securin' our position
Now our greed dangerous as a heart condition
Rap niggas lie like politicians
So I gotta tell the truth, that's a smart decision
Capitalism is a cataclysm
If white collar crime is a bad decision
Then the makers who routinely crash the system
Would quickly get they asses dragged to prison
Need money to eat, need money to live
Need money to keep, need money to give
But when pursuit of the money is your only goal
Then you lose control, then you lose your soul
Dollars and cents to rob our children of their innocence
So when it's sent, we come to our nation's capital to cash the check
According to Dr. King when he saw it clear in his dream
"We built the pyramids, they built a pyramid scheme"

Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
(Intro Talib Kweli)
Yo, we're going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So, whenever you hear the word love
Know that, it's going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated, yo
(Verse 1 Talib Kweli)
Love is blind, you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic, then got to frantic
Then things thats normally small become gigantic
Now y'all sinkin like the Titanic here come the panic
Being with you like a habit, without you I can't stand it
It's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin a nut off, communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned on wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf...
Yo, see what I'm sayin'
It's like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is
We just don't understand our fundamental differences
I'm still learning though, actually
I just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally
(Chorus Les Nubians)
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
(Verse 2 Talib Kweli)
Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say "word"
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up, but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there
Let's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin over drums
Word (te quiero) I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in
Never drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin approachin
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust I'll always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be
Love {*different language*} it ain't nuttin but a word
A chicken ain't nuttin but a bird
Yo, yo, yo
(Chorus Les Nubians)
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
(Verse 3 Talib Kweli)
Some of y'all in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
That's what your beauty remind me of
It's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and that's a different thing
Anything but Queen I'll go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
But they dont understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish
Some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like "Shit, he payin for your rent" missin the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
It's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated
Learn how to speak it, and become emancipated
It's a language
Universal love...
(Chorus Les Nubians)
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
Love love love love, love, love (Repeated)
Hands in the air (4X)
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Bridge 1:Talib Kweli)
Every day I gotta wake up early
Let it break, thank the Lord at the take
Get the troops, hit the booth, spit  at you, spit it great
Practicing my gratitude, life is so beautiful
Working on that attitude, just because
(Hook:  Marsha Ambrosius)
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Verse 1: Talib Kweli)
Every day I gotta
Trust in God and hustle hard
My grind is real, my hustle dope
I’m finding meals, I’m signing deals
I’m the Gladiator like Russell Crowe
Yeah, you know it’s real, but I’m focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause you’re not in tune, no, you’re not immune
No Echinacea, no golden seal
So you sick inside, gotta flush it down
When you talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain’t nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you’re out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you’re gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut
That clock only thing you punchin' out
I relate to you, you gotta pay your dues
When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you’re made to do
I got faith in you, you’re gonna make it through
Cause you don’t chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a baby due
You won’t taste no fruits like Naked Juice
Wo!! The world won't wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vow
As long as you on planet earth put family first got to make 'em proud
Hey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts
Keep talking bout how stressed you are
Better talk about how blessed you are
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Bridge 2:  Marsha Ambrosius)
Every day I got to get up early, wake the kids
Get on running made again
Go to work watching in
Every day I’m hustling
Fight the traffic, lose my cool
Get the kids up at the school
Life it’s hard, yeah, that’s true
This is what I have to do
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Verse 2: Talib Kweli)
Walk with God be still and listen
Try to talk to God what's real I’m spitting
Call 'em Christ by name but he still ain’t rising
Set to my lane but still ain’t listening
Got ice in the veins remain so frigid
Still in the kill brain cells when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don’t stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain’t living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanksgiving
People of colour 25% more likely than whites to face prison
But just because the president is black there’s no more racism?
Post-racial? More like most racial
The hate for you disgraceful
Don’t let it take you off your base, let it motivate you
Don’t let it overtake you, so what another cloud
Survive the storm by riding on the beasts of the southern wild
Wow
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
Memories live, man, and my memories stay alive..
(more talk)
Heed the battle call, check the catalog
Flow so crazy it's adderall with the padded walls
More twisted turns in the body that's on the baddest broad
These cattle call 'rappers' is weak, my honor matter more
Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store
You mannequins are Chante & Kenny, I mean the Latter more
No ping pong and we volleying with the back and forth
Straight King Kong and the trap we blasting off, son

You want Nigerian money, see me in Qatar drunk
Waving the K, I can't fake the funk
Blessed with the belts, flying in the stealth
Jewelry on the neck, diamonds in the Cheals
You know I wrestle with pawns, getting my money, we gone
The automatic laying player, we Dons
You can't see us, the new phenoms, I like the Benz zeons
Split your wig like I got three arms
I need a fiancé, at least a Beyoncé
I know my vision beyond some other shit
I'm just as meaty as moms
I'm supposed to be on, the greenery gone
I'm still the king of the drama
Put the Ruger down your throat, eat my Johnson nigga

Way they all in their feelings, what's wrong with niggas
Forgetting silence is still a response
The way the blood paint the wall you can tell he really an artist
I get it like Whitey Bulger 'til rapture, dearly departed
 x2
We gon' Lex in, my nigga
These are blessings, my nigga
Keep stressing, my nigga
Don't stress, little nigga
Eat a clip, little nigga
Niggas trip, little nigga
Violations we gon' flip, little nigga

It's the champion flow, the Jordan, LeBron and Kobe
The Obi Wan Kenobi, of getting that guap-a-mole
We touring overseas, got her fanning out like a Dakota
I'm trying to get the check, I'm Martina Navratilova
Catch me at the races, gateway at Saratoga
They trying to place my face cause we mobbing, we taking over
My niggas keep it pure while you cut with the baking soda
These rappers be stretching the truth like they taking yoga
Couch potatoes, now they made us into a vegetable culture
A result of division like it's a decimal quotient
Do the math, my nigga, do the math
You'd never settle for less than the whole if you knew the half

Rough as alligator skin getting crazy grip
I'm so amazing with words I make a baby spit
Resting in Tibet, wild with the Gillette
Giraffe long goose on, my boots is 
Pocket full of coins, producers on set
Niggas with the coupes is on next
The losers gon' step, the users gon' check
We choosing our ninjas, the Jews is on deck
Refuse, that's a debt, pool with the steps
Everybody see us, the tools is all TECs
Anything come through we school, wan' bet?
Fuck you gon' tell us? He knew we on next

They wanna act like they know me, you don't know me nigga
You got the baby boy hustle, you a Jody nigga
You wanna swim with the sharks, I'm Chief Brody killin'
Get your jaw tapped this is raw rap, come on, yeah
 x2
Take it to the top
Yea, that's where we at with it, hah
Take it to the top
Just cause you are a character, uh
Don't mean you have character
We taking stock right now
You ready? Let's go

A wise man know what he know, and what he doesn't
If he's not really sure what he's saying, he don't discuss it
A righteous man walks the earth without judgment
And loves his enemies enough to deliver justice
A pious man relies on religion for his direction
At times he introspective, but his biblehood never questioned
A dying man will make a confession, try to get into heaven
Thinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing
A violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his
Get post-traumatic stress disorder, become an officer
A man of peace uses his words in different mediums
He'll bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience
An honest man knows only liars are scared of the truth
His word is his bond but his action's always the proof
A faithful man never need evidence to believe
But still he gotta work for the blessings that he receives
Let's go

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

Top tier niggas blossomed in the basement
All the nights that we were lacking those refreshments
Rain down, thunderstorm with the flows
Articulate with the bounce now I'm back like I'm Derrick Rose
Once the one on the bench with the snotty nose
Nefertiti would hold me when I was cold
Communion Sunday, my twenties went in the bowl
Forgive me Lord for them bitches the night before
Business deals and the Bentleys I can't afford
Gotta be the example for children to do their chores
Blowing weed smoke on the cover of The Source
Rolling Stones, on the gone, it was the boss
Fallen soldier on his own so we march
Roll up a bag of that weed, therefore I spark
Recite the Quran, I'm in the dark
Devil knocking on my door, he like a narc

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

No excuses, if I start it then I'll see it through
God is what I see in you so you might as well believe in you
Think what you see on TV's true? The media deceiving you
They misrepresenting, misquoting then they misleading you
Belief is a funny thing, in case you're wondering
If they want the ring, they coming for the throne like they the sons of kings
These average rappers is acting up for the dough
Yeah I tell you what I believe but I back it up with what I know (oh!)
It's the facts versus the facts simile, your raps killing me
My last victory was great moments in Black history
I celebrated with a bottle I just brought back from Italy
And some loud, I got super packs like I backed Hillary
Lost in desire, I walked through the Devil's fire
I inspire the resurrection of kings like Hezekiah
The trust you put in me to be a, beast with this rhyming
That's where the rubber meets the road and where your faith meets science
Let's go

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

Take it to the top, take it to the top
Yeah, yeah, take it to the top, take it to the top
Take it to the top, take it to the top
Check it out baby
Check it out y'all
This that upper echelon shit
What is this?
Welcome to the Prisoner of Conscious

Brainiac dum-dum, bust the scientifical
You feel it all up in your soul, we getting spiritual
You heard I'm coming back, it's so scary I put the fear in you
I murder every track, cause the rhymers like to stare at you
Real shit back, it's a miracle
Rap been laughable over the last year or two
Reflecting like a mirror through who is the real living proof
I'm back with the classical shit, I pack lyrical
Substance like bowls of kush into a vaporizer
And then I vaporize ya', my paper may surprise ya'
No need to brag on my paper cause I'm a naturizer
I vibrate higher, the truth break liars
I chose who is like us
The lovers, the fighters, the writers, the exciters
Cut the grass we could see the vipers
We cut the glass cause we the diamonds


I be listening to real shit, real spit, like die hard feeling
Type of shit the fake niggas find hard to deal wit'
I'm on a higher plane, I'm destroying em' while I build them
My threat can't be contained, so my name on Obama kill list
Kweli the artist that you wanna be
Moving the through darkness, the light is what's in front of me
Front on me you posers exposing your insecurities
Supposedly it's wack and replaces lack of maturity
The purity you need to get in the game is gone
Ain't no conspiracy, stop looking for someone to blame it on
Gotta pay a debt, took a stale style and I made it fresh
Wait a second, got your girl wetter than tomato flesh
Waiting on me with baited breath


Welcome to the
Walking through double fisted, I'm lifted on something vicious
Everything is moving, I'm getting me a percentage
Vintage, nothing but the sky is my ascendant
My girl is ride or die, I'm avoiding the evil temptress
Ain't no question who the best is
You don't like it stay the fuck out of my mentions
Pimping down to the socks, and so is business
The all night workout like 24-Hour Fitness
Y'all niggas is adorable, incorrigible
The praise that you get is barely audible
People is ignoring you, why?
The last place in the world that you belong is a recording booth
Order suit, niggas is gassed up
Petroleum a lab when these niggas get swept up
Custodians of culture, back to the future rap, DeLorean
I class up the joint the spit is valedictorian
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (status for life)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (yeah)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (hey, hey)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (yeah)

Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (uh, ay, ay)

Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap clap for me hey
Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap, now bring it back

Welcome to the new age where they're thirsty for that Kool-Aid
Thirsty for first in that page, really thirsty just to be fake
Be the first to hate what you say, trying to diss you calling you "gay"
Such an urgent need to express yourself, but really nothing to say
Don't fuck with us, we too tough, get high like you do drugs
Like spit me out I'm chewed up my life is chopped and screwed up
I know you up in this club, I know you don't give a fuck
You told me what you don't like, you made that clear, now what do you love?
There's gotta be more, some live the life of the rich, some people gotta be poor
I've been through a door, I will not sell you a dream, that's what the lottery for
The music is clay, I shaped it, I molded it, like it was pottery or
The mouth with the law, twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw
Free as the diamond you found on the floor, I furnished the rhyme with the proper decor
I burnished the nine in my mind with the galore, so they burning with shaman, I'm popping the door
To top it all off, if your style is married to substance, you sound like you got a divorce
That's why I'm blocking and unfollowing y'all, I done forgot what I'm following for
Enough about y'all, now back to me, ain't no academic leave, I'm not faculty
These new slaves ain't ready for my masterpiece, so when they hear me rap it's catastrophe
Cause a casualty so casually they mistake what I do for having beef
I don't actually wish anybody harm, now stretch your arms and clap for me

Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap clap for me hey
Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap, now bring it back

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (yeah), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)

I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (no), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)

I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders

Oh lord
Ever since the day I was born, that marks the day I was chosen
To rise above them all and be a leader, I'm like Malcolm X when on the podium
Martin Luther with a dream, Rosa Parks on the bus, though as funny as it seems it remind me of us
Through the money and the fame ain't shit gon' change for the light we adjust
Do it for the children without a ceiling to live up under
Times getting hard, that's why my niggas smoke that tropic thunder
If all our people spreaded love instead of evil
We would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal
Stay true, I gave you my oath, what would the ancient God my nigga Thoth
Through all the books and the screens I was taught, I look at myself and pretend to learn the most
Our leaders dead and gone, what's left for the believers?
If you looking for the truth, one word: Underachievers, nigga

Clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap for me uh (put your hands together)
Clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap, now bring it back

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (wake up), catch up with us cause we leaving (catch up)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)

Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (wake up), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah, catch up)
Got enough followers (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers (what), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)

As I change the so called predestined course of my life
Advance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light
Moving these intricate insecurities out of sight
Moving myself forward from the darkness into the light
I take flight, it's goodbye to all the negativity
That plague millions of young innocent souls like me
Gave me the genius mind state necessary
To feast off of mother's unlimited figurative tree
Of life, I tried to tell these niggas that our purpose is to move it
Something like Darwin's beliefs of humans in evolutions
As I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism
I wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism
Would you rest my soul, I'm blinding me to a blurry of visions
In light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming, catch up with us cause we leaving
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (no), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)

Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
I see ya, Yeah I see ya
See, I'm lookin right at you, I eye-contact you
You see me, and I'mma be me, Uh
First, I'm sayin Hi, then I'm wavin Bye-bye
We get in, we get in
Girl, you're so fly, you're so fly

Yo, these swallows is horny as Charlie Parker
Be cutting em cause I'm studying these birds like ornithology
Follow em when they tweeting, holler instead of speaking
Give it a name, she played the wicked games every weekend
Broke up with a dude for almost ending her life
Came over for the closure, ended up spending the night
Got cozy in this apartment, wine bottles started popping
Put scratches up on his back, they questioning where he got them
Forgot it was her, she Freddy, her fingers was like machetes
The fucking was so steady, she shredded him like confetti
Confronted him 'bout every single chick, shes like "enough already,"
I need to be with someone else, this stuff is so petty
She was reacting to things he did in the past
This nigga was no saint, he couldn’t say no to ass
Her behavior so rash, she gave up all her power
He put her out on the street, nowhere to live, nowhere to shower
How she gonna make it through the night?
How she's so accepting of her station in life?

She always carrying a baby with her
Her spitting image just like looking at her baby pictures
Her fate is sealed cause she dependent on a man for real
How she running these streets but always standing still?
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
How she running the streets but still standing still?
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel

Battery in the back, popping up with the coppertop
Popular with the ass of the Hottentot
Niggas whooping and hollering at Andromeda when she passing the barber shop
Only job that's an option McDonalds or telemarketer
Hard for her making ends come together, this ain't the Beatles
She needing some anesthesia like she going under needles
She doing so much cutting, its a wonder she bleeding
The money was so seductive, no wonder she ain't leaving
First time she felt like a woman was when a dude screamed
"Nice ass!" out the car window driving past
Nobody showed her how to live so all she do is dream
They call her Rocky cause her makeup is like a mask
 scars permanently lodged on her frontal lobe
Behind bars for credit card schemes she pulled a month ago
First she getting high, now we waving bye-bye
She's waiting out her station just the same
As she's waiting at the station late at night for a train that never came
Moving at the speed of a solution
Bleeding in the streets as we're breathing the pollution
They're saying that we need a revolution
But their passion is reduced to all-caps on a computer
Hey, every sixteen I make a sick scene
Blood splattered all on you shirt like a Miskeen
Y'all niggas trippin' like mescaline and mixed greens
My flow cleaner than the Sistine, pristine
You going green like Al Gore with 'em
I make algorithms that got Malcolm in 'em
God's favorite, I'm sick as a doctor's patient
We live in a cold world, my job is to rock nations
My occupation? Elation, a celebration of rebels
Raise the levels and the decibels flagrant
It's too amazing how we be blazing, son
Our flowers is the loudest, they crowd around us
But cower in the shadows of the towers, boy

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off

Yo, I plaster the nation, causing evacuation
My manifestation got 'em patient from how I keeps it amazing
See, I'm the reason niggas need some training
While I'm inflicting the pain and making it suitable for any occasion
I'm very engaging soon as I'm awaken
Quickly back you up and bag your bitch
She's reminding me of Sanaa Lathan
Rely on the hating while I'm smiling and waiting
That's when I embrace 'em
If you try to front, you'll be highly mistaken
The mightiest making of a classic, alrighty, I'll face it
My psyche is ancient and I'm hiring, so try me, I'm patient
Sorry, I'm lying, face it, I'm back for the taking
I'm urgently giving niggas the courtesy of smashing their face in
(Damn, can you cut his mic off?)
See how we got 'em buggin'
Cause they can't believe what we have in the making
Shit so historic, got me goin' for it while I bang the nation
And do niggas greasier than a slab of bacon

Bitch, you still cooking this pork in this house?
Stop cooking that damn pork in this house
The hell going on in here?

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off

These rap niggas is bitches, nothing but suckers to me
Sacrifice myself for the music and let them suffer through me
Your weak product is nothing to me
I only feel effects when I fuck with Louis
Yep, I get buck in the studio like I'm Evil Dee
Pulling strings like the Muppet movie
Shining my light like Mos calling his mother Umi
Who's the hottest regardless of who's flaming?
We ain't talkin' 'bout the best until you mention my name
Who're you kidding? The truest spitting
I'll break you like a mirror so it's clearer
That we don't believe in superstition
These new additions need supervision
Thinking that they can spit it in the booth like me
What are you stupid? Listen
I've been official, it's been official, I'm too consistent
I make a claim cause I'm too official for euphemisms
Staying in the cut like a new incision
I'll put you on your ass like True Religion
So give it up for the truest living

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

Yeah I like to go out to clubs
Las Palmas, you know
She this envy if I wanna get grimey wit' it at Bungalow Eight
Opium down in Miami
But when I walk in, I look around and I think

I look at all the lonely people (x4)

Yo, I'm headin' out, 'bout to do some fleshin' out
I know my flesh endowed
With somethin' to prove, I'm settin' out
On a trip to Heaven's mouth, yeah
I'm steppin' out in the name of love
Who knew the Devil could slow dance?
We have pathological romances with technological advance
Infatuated with infatuation and
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
Make a baby mama's all bastardization and
Lonely people all through the city
They club hoppin' and they love shoppin' and they thug posturin'
Thugs be lockin' horns with Crips on them drug blocks
And them dollars flow right out of the 'hood
When you tryin' to make paper out of the wood
You know that money don't grow on trees
For paper people change colors like leaves
And they fall off in the mud like a filthy pig
Makin' you and your dogs who store all call off
That much deserved ass whippin'
He snitchin', he twitchin', he bitchin', he all soft
Never work with his hands
Little kid on the block who always ran
At all costs, gotta be in the club
Lookin' for happiness or the meaning of love
Then it hit him, out the blue like a vision
All of a sudden he don't like the way he been livin'
And wanna be forgiven
How I know? Cuz I'm right there wit' him
Yo, yo


Tattoos tell 'em who you are
Plastic Surgery coup d'etat the God
Uh, lasers to remove the scar
And then you are, you a supastar, supastar
It's your birthday and you in the club
Talkin' "Holla back" and "Nigga what"
So much cleavage and asscrack
If pussy were a stock it would plummet on the Nasdaq
Blank stares like nobody care
In a room so exclusive nobody there
But really, truth is that nobody there
Cuz it's feelings inside that nobody share
I want God to smile on me
But see, fame is a drug and you wild on E
Celebrities decorated like Christmas trees
God complex like they born on Christmas Eve
Sing a song to yourself and you stand alone
Get nominated for a gold gramophone
Walk the red carpet, left your man at home
Security snatchin' people camera phones
You got rose gold yellow bottles, pink Cashmere
So ahead of the trend, that's so last year
Last month, last day, last hour, last minute
Your pursuit of cool is so passionate
Doin for the cash in it, laugh in his face
If it's def or anybody who don't stay in his place
So popular can't go nowhere, folks stoppin' ya
Might want to check a thermometer
When you go to a movie heat rises
Surrounded by people still lonely, that's why you need disguises
Probably
This the year of the BlackSmith
Talib Kweli, Kwame, let's go
Yeah, niggas don't listen
Back in the days we all used to listen
Now shit is so wack, nobody listen
To that real hip hop, yo, listen

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
Something I wanna tell you
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me ya ears
Start repentin' cause the ending is near
But don't panic, you can't function if you livin' in fear
Pay attention, you gotta listen to hear
(Wait just a minute), who the fuck you think talkin' to?
Put you on hold, get a specialist to walk you through
Kweli, the flow captain of fast and slow rappin'
I'm so crackin', you ain't heard? Ya shit appear like closed captions
King of the bars and I'm goin' hard, pause
All my confidence comes from knowin' God's Laws
Bangin' on the system, fightin' my kinda war
Loud as a whisper, quiet as a lion's roar

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, it's for ya spirit so
But y'all hear me though
Get up, get into it and get involved
There's a little something that I wanna spit for y'all
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

Get it now, get it fast, get it right
Get it big, get it locked, get it done, get it tight
(I think I wanna feel you)
But you don't really hear me though
I spit clearly so it's live outcha stereo
To your heart while it's beatin' in ya chest
When you speakin' to execs and they see behind the desk
To ya spirit, nothing weaker than the flesh
So while you try to keep it fresh, you gettin' deeper into debt
Real hip hop is missin' from the shelf
Yup, it's what you felt when you listen to yaself
Only a few is makin' cuts that's spinnin'
So before you spend ya hard earned spinach

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, it's for ya spirit so
But y'all hear me though
Get up, get into it and get involved
There's a little something that I wanna spit for y'all
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

You love the sounds comin' out your speaker
I spit rounds like a nine millimeter
The youth today, they frown at the teachers
They ain't down with no leaders
They don't wanna wait (just a minute)
They like, "What? Nigga, wait right there"
I got 'Reservoir Dogs', you'll be missin' a right ear
Get it clear, I figure it's my year
I'm everywhere, makin' appearances in nigga's nightmares
Hear the word, peep the flow, check the cadence
What you heard as a pro, I'm so amazing
Don't front, girl, you know it's ya favorite
New Kweli, yo, they runnin' out of patience

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, it's for ya spirit so
But y'all hear me though
Get up, get into it and get involved
There's a little something that I wanna spit for y'all
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait
Yo, don't it sound so good to you?
It's the return of the greatest, y'all
Talib Kweli, BKMC
BlackSmith is the movement, BlackSmith is the music
Whatchu ridin' for?
Whatchu livin' for?
Whatchu dyin' for?
(I think I wanna feel you)
Bangin' on ya eardrum, yeah
Wait now, wait now, wait now for a minute
Listen
Wait now, wait now, wait now for a minute
No matter what the obstacle is, we fight through it
To survive is only half the battle, we won't lose it
So have faith in better days on the way
I lend my hand to you, whenever you need me I'll stay
I understand sometimes, the world is type cloudy
But like a plane that's over the game, we fly out it
Determination, dedication til the end
I'm there every step of the way, until we win
Cause I believe in prayer, in God Almighty
Get them burdens off your shoulder, send them to the highest
But we can beat it, overcome the lows
Being positive is key, you believe and it shows
I spread awareness, be mindful of your health
Be here for one another so you never by yourself
One step at a time, one time for the cause
I rep it for the world, I rap it for us all

Don't run away from who you are
Life's beautiful (life is beautiful)
Pick yourself back on up
Life's beautiful (life is so beautiful)

This the highway of life, we stay driven
Then at some point, you arrive at a decision
To fly high, we weather any condition
We doing more than surviving because we living
The music feel good -- yes sir, it'll satisfy you
Like a meal would, real good when it's going down
It's the flavor that you savor when you wait
It tastes great -- compliments to the chef, he got taste
Clean your plate, clear the music in front of a glass of water
Taking stale pictures, see the crystals forming
The horns make me feel victorious, the keys make me feel glorious
The drums make me feel like a warrior
The track feel big, Notorious
Do it for the people feeling trapped in the corridor
Nobody know what you're going through in a day
But don't let yesterday ruin today
And they say..


They say it's all for the money, but I don't wan' believe it
I'm a man of my word, so whatever you been hearing
Is the truth -- flatline, polygraph, that's me
We could all use a break -- spare of Apache
Catch me crossing items off my bucket list
Cause life is good as you want it to get
I paint a different portrait with any color I find
The canvas is the world and the brush is my mind
I don't mind stepping out my comfort zone
I think the greatest fear is the one of the unknown
If you afraid of living and you afraid of death
Then I'm afraid you'll never take a step to the left
Or the right direction
Tonight's confession -- I used to be scared of my own reflection
And what would really happen if I fought that vision
But the matter all along -- if it's not good, it's gone
Nowadays we be rocking glasses for fashion
And fucking with life a fraction
Covered in Max Factor, hustling ass-backwards
As sure as Hi-Tek look like Richard from Last Dragon
Your focus on bogus rappers got you caught up in distraction
Distraction. Who fucking who? Who cares? That's distraction
You wish it was you, don't you -- why you asking?
Try to break the law of attraction
Get a piece of my attention like a fraction of a ration
Or a measly little morsel
They suck your blood and you believe in the immortals
We nocturnal like a sleeping disorder
See the water drawing away from the shore
This ain't no ordinary storm
We killing for a humanitarian cause
But have yet to show up in Darfur
The Arab Spring is what it's called
But it's looking at the pride before the fall
They say it ain't about the spoils of war
But turn around and tell you how much more the oil will cost
Steal the land from the Native American and call the missiles Tomahawks
Make him a mascot, dress up like him for sport
As a final assault to his beautiful culture
Scavengers, feasting on the dead like a vulture
Snacking; how you keeping up with my rapping?
You barely keeping up with Kardashians
You caught up in distraction
It's the living proof -- you try to make the truth elastic as Mr. Fantastic
We recycling these rappers
Truthfully, these niggas is plastic
Coming through the front door blasting
I ain't talking bout them e-mails
That you always send to the masses
That somehow end up in my trash bin
My niggas got the aim of sharpshooters and the hearts of assassins
All this war, all this life, all this passion
The game is distraction
Give a fuck if the President wear a flag pin
Rhyming is deep as holes Chilean miners are trapped in
Or the cracks in the earth under Asia Minor causing disasters
My deep cuts way above your minor infractions
Talk to rappers like children cause that's how they acting
They holding their hands like minors in traffic
The captains of industry and the lovers of status quo
Have a deep-seeded fear of change
For them it's strange -- they wanna go
Back to the 50's, they asking for a return
But them days is much blacker, for lack of a better term
We adapted to the times, but this culture we had to learn
Came about as natural as a perm on a pachyderm
These fascists have had their turn
We packing them German burners, them Lugers
The next shooters waiting for Superman, they get nothing but Lex Luthor
America's nightmare, vivid as Fred Kruger
Our heroes are dead to us
Spirit that bled through us
Endear us with the spirit so the flow is so foolish
What you hearing is precision
The people so thirsty, what they seeing is mirages
But this passion Photoshopping and your YouTube collages
Coming through like Collossus
Exposing the false prophet
Taught how to do the knowledge so I'm never off-topic
A lie is like a potion
First it gets you open
Then you swallow whole straight for the truth
Fuck the chaser, skip religion and the politics
And head straight to the compassion
Everything else is a distraction
Chorus:
She's got a ticket I think she gonna use it
Think she gone to fly away
(Where you going?)
No one should try and stop her
Persuade her with their power
She says that her mind is made
Spoken: This a story we all familiar with
Verse 1:
Yeah we all tryin to live worry free
Pretty young things affection is like currency
Talking bout a country girl living in a city though
Searching but she get her moral compass from these videos
Girl you'll be killing and searching your faith or new tears
Courage under fire especially after a few beers
Already broke the resolution for a new year
They blushin cause they sayin it's nothing inside a few years
Until I came across this dame I used to baby sit
At the club looking for this lame she had a baby with
Wait a minute you're only 17 and she said to me
My baby gave me strength to leave the city life ain't meant for me
Father can't be bothered, I'm here to make my peace
So offered her some money but she started quoting Jay to me
I'll do you one better, I slay these niggas faithfully
I don't need you to pay for me, I just need to pray for me
Chorus:
She's got a ticket I think she gonna use it
Think she gone to fly away
(Where you going?)
No one should try and stop her
Persuade her with their power
She says that her mind is made
Verse 2:
When you call up and captain say that ain't no hero
What you really bring to the table let's keep the real dough
No matter where you're going if you don't get your mind right
First choose between two evils like this is Twilight
She up in the kitchen tonight cooking the grams up..
Gotta take you to right the Peter Pan but
She gotta take it to..she got a grant..
She gotta take it to fly she had a lan and she try
She tryin to avoid the trap is like the cancer
The love of money run in her vein, now she a dancer
Now the blow go in her nose to keep her dancin'
The high is the only escape, she like a phantom
A ghost just a sell of herself packing them pasttense
Closer to selling herself, using her assets
Ain't nothing left to shake let's break it all down
Got it inside her veins, she takin' off now

Fly high, fly fly
Sky high, yeah
Hole up, where you're going girl
Where you're going, hole up
Where you're going girl
Where you're going, hole up
Where you're going girl
Where you're going, hole up
Where you're going, damn
Verse 3:
Damn, I'll found her later that she don't know who her father was
I’m like this crazy, a baby ain’t got no starter kit
She never met the real..foe they tried to steal her goodies
They breakin' into her candy store
We holdin' pistols and Willy Wonka for soulja sistas
Cause when we're taking the gold and taking the coldest winter
Statistics will give you the truest picture of the youth
The visionary’s on a mission for new beginnings
It’s hard enough when you radiate a twenty block radius
Wondering who the father of the baby is
To pay relationships to her like sound fiction out to table
And public you write a buy you and provide it with the title
Body of a woman with the eyes of a child
Driven that she could..is it now
Want her future to be as bright as a smile
She like I see her spinning that Wheel of Fortune, let’s buy a vowel

Hole up
I realized early that black girls carry universes inside their bodies
Waiting to be named whole continent
Land masses that were once connected
Flow through her arms fingers, chest, legs, stomach
Feet and head
Ghanna is her heart, her lungs charity
Her tongue I'm.., her bones massai
Her breath Aboriginal her skin the color of Moroccan
Sand in south african sky lines
Her blue blood separates the land fro our riversand great legs
The place where we shit and drink
The place that we love and hate
Colonize and liberate
Conquer and rebuilt right and so up
Escape and imprisoned
The place where questions like if you a woman
Raise your hand will get you killed
 + (Talib)
Deliver us, deliver us (Yeah)
Deliver us, deliver us (What? Yeah)

And what the people say? We wanna live it up
And what the people want? Please deliver us
And what the people need? Hey...
I got that, yeah

I call these rappers baby seals, cause they club you to death
I could call 'em Navy SEALs, cause they government feds
What become of the vets? They drugged up, they fucked up, they in debt
There ain't no love and no respect, it's like a gang it's like a club or a set
Hip-Hop's the new WWF
What do you rap or do you wrestle? Niggas love to forget
We got til it's gone, you think you on, you still hustlin backwards
Your topical norm a tropical storm, it's a fuckin disaster
Back to the topic we on, it all started at Rawkus
They couldn't find the words to describe me so they resort to the shortcuts
Is he a backpacker? Is he a mad rapper?
An entertainer? or the author of the last chapter?
We living in these times of love and cholera
Synonymous with the apocalypse, look up the clouds is ominous
We got maybe ten years left say meteorologists, shit
We still waitin for the Congress to acknowledge this!
 & (singers in the background)
What the people want? Please deliver us
We wanna live it up, please deliver us
Th-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel
I'm reaching through the fire - please deliver us
I'm preaching to the choir - please deliver us
Just keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow, we need someone to follow

You ain't promised tomorrow, so get your paper up
You can't always just borrow and asks for favors bruh
Stand on your own two, never covet thy neighbor's stuff
Karma's a bitch so watch your mouth and what you sayin bruh
I start a conversation based on general observation
Hip-Hop is not a nation, take it to population
Niggas got a lot to say when locked inside the belly of Satan
Awaitin trial debatin how the hell I got placed in this system
Am I a victim or just a product of indoctrination?
They exploit it and use me like a movie with product placement
You hear the congregation; this is the hostile gospel
The truth is hard to swallow it'll leave you scarred tomorrow
Keep it honest our motto, these niggas keep it bottled
I'm the writer who reach the fighters like speeches by Cus D'Amato
DJs stickin to vinyl like "Fuck Serato"
Suppliers who ride around the block, in the custom autos
Ballin like the struck the lotto you know who the cleanest is
A nigga keep it reeich with the stitch and greedy geniuses
I'm not a hipster, but I flip it like a sneaker pimp
Expose the game, treat it like a bitch
Smack fire out these hoes, cause they snitch and tap wires while I plead the fifth
You can't trust a soul in the biz, so be careful who you eatin with
And sleepin with and also who you chiefin with
You never know they might've added in secret ingredients


Freedom's a road that's seldom traveled, watch hell unravel
Right before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle
The single mother who raised her daughter to bear the sacred water
And not take the hand of every man who make a offer
To black kids wishin they white kids, when they close they eyelids
Like, "I bet they neighborhood ain't like this"
White kids wishin they black kids, and wanna talk like rappers
It's all backwards it's identity crisis
The industry inside us is vipers with fangs trying to bite us
Drug suppliers is the health care providers
We cakin, makin narcotics outta household products
We ain't workin out 'til we exorcise the demons that's inside us
Plus they seem to just provide us with enough rope to hang ourselves
Enough dope to slang ourselves, enough toast to bang ourselves
It's officially nigga season, these niggas is bleedin
That's why I'm spittin freedom we had enough of trigger squeezin


In these tryin days and times
All I need is to be free
I can't do it on my own
Lord can you deliver me?
There are trials still to come
It's salvation that I need
So I'm reachin to the sky
Lord can you deliver me?
Deliver us...
Deliver us, yeah
Deliver us, ohhhhhhhhhh
Oh, deliver us
Deliver us
Ohhhhh Deliver us yes
Deliver us, deliver us, deliver us
Yeah yeah yeah, ohhhhhhhhhh... {*ad libs to fade*}
You are now witnessing the demise of the music business
I say demise of the music business cause people always gonna need music in they life
You know what I'm saying?
I can't do music with people I'm uncomfortable with
You know what I'm saying?
I can't be on stage with you pouring out my soul if I don't like you
So with that said, shout out to Strong Arm Steady
Shout out to Jean Grae
That's my Blacksmith family, you dig?

I just heard a song that reminded me of times when you was finding me
Rhyming in Greenwich Village circa 1993
Yeah, those was the salad days, my career's appetizer
The main course a casserole, a jambalaya
Of different influences that led me where the music is
A student is only as good as his teachers' tutelage
Paying for college, not learning was straight foolishness
So I stopped going to school but this was
Hard to tell my parents -- sat them down, tried to get through to them
Started flowing daily and traveled to different places
Freestyled with Clef and Forte in the Booga Basement
With Rubix and Juju on Flatbush, my hood amazing
Platinum Island recording with Duro and Just Blaze
And that was right next door to Rawkus -- what's up, Jarret and Brian Blackshaw?
And Matt Fingaz; Kendra Ross, you got the soul of a Stax singer
I love how you always bring it back, sister
You and Reesy making every record
I got classics with Hi-Tek and Mos Def that are so respected
Shout out to Corey Smyth, shout out to Dave Chapelle
I went on tour with The Roots, they played so well
Writing rhymes with Myka 9
Me and Pharoahe Monch were Soundbombing
Me and Lonnie Lynn got a lot in common
Mystik Journeymen introduced me to Top Ramen
On the bus, Kanye West would never stop rhyming
Ain't no mountain high enough for him, he never stopped climbing
That's why when the homies win, I never stop smiling
See I'm smiling right now

Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt, that's how its gotta be
This is my odyssey, it's just the God in me
Friends and family
Yup, they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family
That's right, and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up -- it's like you all my fam
Friends and family
Like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin, thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family

It started with a blast, now I'm a iconoclast
Promise to be honest in my craft and make the promise last
I do this for myself, but the song for you
Once I put it out for sale then it belong to you
This for Amani Fela plus Diyani Eshe
Your daddy love his girl, your mother never far away
This is for Eque, this for Kierra Paul
We wanna ride like Ciara and we will never fall
HeadCquarterz and Guru is love forever y'all
Make it plain cause its too strong for a metaphor or simile
Your legacy will always be remembered for forever or
Til the end of time whichever come first
Big love to my mom and dad -- you could have done worse
Jamal and I the way we are cause you put your sons first
Many black parents lose they sons to the gun burst
Mommas drowning in they own tears til they lungs burst
Voice cracking like Michael Stipe cause everyone hurts


First record was with Mood back in '96
In fact, it was pretty fresh -- Google that, find that shit
It sound good; I was showing you what timeless is
You couldn't catch what I was saying without rewinding it
Believe me, every fan is special
You hear me now but I got fans from Lyricist Lounge and "Manifesto"
So much wack rap, I know its hard to tell the difference
But when I heat it up I make the garbage smell
I'm resurrected but I'm no savior
I know the game, I can ball a little bit -- I'm an OK Player
Double meaning cause the flow is layered
We love to say it but its easier than it sound to ignore the haters
To snap back like the jaws of gators
Been around the world many times
Seen many things
And they in color too
Seen women so beautiful
That I could die with a smile on my face
And not feel like the good lord gypped me
(The space between love and me
Between...)

How you expect to have an ordinary relationship
With such an extraordinary nigga
Yea there's flaws in what you figured
Ain't the liquor that got you considering calling up the sitter
Telling her you need a couple hours and of course you tip her
I like my fantasies, half stripper half glass slipper
Wrappin' one like a riddle with enigma
Character in my flip book
Coming to life when I'm flipping through the pictures
Switching up the positions
My karma karma chameleon
Change colors with the surroundings
I can hear you with my eyes and I'm loving the way you sound
And I'm smothering and I'm grindin'
Now doubt is counting me out
Loving in public when we coming and
Up against the cupboard til we...
(Look like turquoise)
Right on the couch
(Yellow on the bad day)
Knocking it out without a doubt

(Colors of you)
'Eyo the world is my coloring book
Look, new discoveries every time
When I color outside the lines
(Colors of you)
'Eyo the world is my coloring book
Look, new discoveries every time
When I color outside the lines

(Color of you)
My self expression
Acquire every color in the spectrum
My self reflection make the light change direction
When you see it from this angle the colour, the cut the clarity
Starts bringing me down that's the depravity of gravity
Having me in my blue phase
Go off the grid for a few days
Go on a journey without a suitcase
The security of obscurity in a world of respect
And I'm trading it like a currency
Currently you soft as a mallet hitting a xylophone
He so yella I'm wishin' his fella right his wrong
But naw, instead he is synthetic as styrofoam
Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome
My light'll poke through the clouds
We'll take you higher like you smoking the loud
While I provide the dope kaleidoscope of sound
You can see it with your ears
You can hear it with your eyes
You can feel it right here yea

(Colors of you)
You don't look like turquoise
You don't look like gold
You don't look like purple
That'll match your hue

'Eyo the world is my coloring book
Look, new discoveries every time
When I color outside the lines
(Colors of you)
'Eyo the world is my coloring book
Look, new discoveries every time
When I color outside the lines
(Colors of you)
(Colors of you)
This the high life
Call it my life

This is the byproduct of beautiful love
Fit like a glove, what's good, my people I think we could
Get it you know we should, hold it like it’s a grudge submerged
But I just surf

I’m renting the universe
But the stars don’t fit and my bars are too mega
Is the fruit of my labor, my plate is full of color
Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker

Moon raker, sun scraper, will give you fire for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors
Sire of the flavor, designer of the caper
Executive executor direct when I'm on path
Flight without navigator, plight of a savior

Now what would Jesus do?
How you believe in Him? You don’t believe in you
The idea that you doubting I'm unbeatable
Vizzini in the princess bride - inconthievable
These MCs is eatable, wait - edible
I’m fishing with dynamite, now I got a freezer full
Of rappers, bastards I'm ten steps ahead of you
Incredible, give credit where credit due

Put passion into action
Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing
Accelerate, generate, power with my pen and pape'
Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate

We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate
You imitate, your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it, never gonna say they love what we doing on stage
Even if they don’t one quote and the hate just integrates

They feel us like shade, you know we’re feeling great
Not a script that is writ', this is how originals spit
It's an unconventional gift, kwe we interpolate
Them others be herbin' it, the praise, we deserving it

Word, I love songs, writing to right wrongs
Continue to fight on, I’m putting the gloves on
I love horns, I'm loving this damn track
I’m loving the hand clap, it's the clap, clap
Loving it when you listen
"Love will fix it" said Ashford and Simpson (That's right)
Living for the drums and the slums, some of the best parts
The tourists never come, they run when it gets dark

Yeah, so in my idle space, they're funny like them bridal maids
Booking like we’re playing spades, yeah, we always make the grade
FSC to get a fade, Valencia then to the Haight
Sucka free I’m in my space, say I’m hella steezy, yeah (yee)
Believe I get a so in, streaking like a Martin
Sunny in Dolores, bike parking
Fly chick's sparking
Then we up the road to the Phoenix some steady bar hopping
There's high life everywhere, Tony Allen rhythm is
Pattern that we living in, Kweli on his business
Everywhere we deep in this, shawty’s gon' be speaking it
Oh, they so uniquely spit

The great debater, the saviour, the caped crusader
The alpha, the omega, your favorite communicator
News junky I’m debunking the myth of the job creators
Departed the conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty, I’m bringing it as my nudey
You drinking it like a smoothie, they're spinning it like a sufi
Rappers, I dissect 'em, collecting 'em like a souvie
Near they’re acting up I'm directing 'em like a movie
Skip the drama, this an action-adventure
They so freaking soft it should be against the law
Illegal tender
And yo, do I really need to mention
This is the high life

High life, high life
High life, high life
Cause we be living the high life, high life
High life, high life
Yes, I’m living in the high life, high life
High life, high life
Cause I’m living the high life, high life
Around my way...
Around my way...
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way...

People let me paint a picture
You know I ain't a Christian
I ain't a Muslim, ain't a Jew
I'm losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you, but I don't fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel, truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham, Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block, I'm tracing your footsteps, I keep the faith in you
Your love, plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through, my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive, shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters, rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin' gypsy cabs and chasin' 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad
The way we saluting flags, wrapping them around our heads
When niggas ain't become American till 9/11
Feeling like you gotta sneak into heaven
When the reverend looking like a pimp and the pimp look like the reverend


These conditions make us strong
And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own
A mix tape freestyle become your favorite song
No place like home when the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you, threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guts like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
L.A. to Chicago like Smooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four, cock it back
Drop the flow, rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
You'll finish school, but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood, you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that, this is a legacy and we a part of that
The hood is where my heart is at
Catch me around my way
And nature's game once more begins

Here we go like, yes yes ya'll
To the beat ya'll
Ain't no sleep ya'll
To the break of dawn
Five o'clock in the morning
We keep rockin' on
The workin' people runnin' like the stop clock is on
We got it poppin' in the meat market
Chicks take a seat, park it
By the bar so they can meet the vic with deep pockets
And them dudes buy them cars and turn 'em in to sweet objects of desire
Big rims and them tires
We finna drop it like it's heavy as hell
The Clan of the Cavebear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air
Come through like the Cable Guy
Get 'er done
That 'ole hit 'n run
Turn 'em into bitter ones
Tonight is catch me if you can
You can taste the ginger bread
Ain't nothin' like wakin' up with a stranger in your bed, nope

Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Were am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn

Putting on some Airs
King For a Day
Hard to face your fears we wear the mask like Claude McKay
You have a ball today
It's all a masquerade
Shorty paint her face like a clown but can't take away the frown
Found under the make-up
I asked her, what's your passion
Answered, what's the paper
She sleepin' and they don't want her to wake up
Maybe then she'll realize her own beauty
Baby, you a star and not just a star on some dude's home movies


Steppin' out, I got my best outfit on
Gotta get it in
I'm slippin' in the darkness like most of the day is gone
We up all night I wonder if can hang
We used to hang from a tree, now we hang behind the rope, we V.I.P
We do it B.I.G
Ain't no need to see I.D
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery
Six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance
The ones ready to freak off don't need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced
The truth is so boring you gotta pretend a little
The antidote is more colorful the rainbow that end in Skittles
And the quest to trap the cat
The game is your Tender Vittles to get the bruce to say the sky's fallin
Like you Chicken Little, come on
These times it's hard being a man. I try to explain that to my lady overtime

My girl is a delicate flower, a super-hero
Being a single mom helped develop her powers
We stay up to a elegant hour talking inhaling the sour
Reaching out to God cause the Devil a coward
But he still sits on my shoulder and whispers
It feels like my shoulder gets colder the more that I listen
And now it seems like she ready to leave
We stay to beef the main reason my desire to spreading my seed
I try to tell her I'm just a man
She said "no, you're wrong
Cause you're way more than that
You need to cut the scam
You're not fooling me, this lunacy
Them excuses might be new to the birds
But they ain't new to me."
Yo, I hate when the fit is thrown
It's like everytime I pick up the phone you bitch and moan, whoa
I'm like why you stressing for?
I'm pressing ignore, make me wanna never get involved

I need to reap these benefits
Ooh, you so sensitive
I say serve this royalty
She say I deserve your loyalty
Girls have feelings

Men lie out of fear but we front like we're not afraid
Whether arguing or not, the bills gotta get paid
We are not in 6th grade, we're fighting and people watching
On Twitter she emo-blogging, I'm boiling her hemoglobin
It lead to sobbing the arguments never move me
Cause we acting out the stereotypes like Tyler Perry movies
My indiscretion is reeking in deep betrayal
Libidos are like horses, it's hard to keep em stable
She believed me the way Mike believed in Fredo
But I need her, she the proof in my soul, my sweet potato
Before I let her go I know she'll be forever gone
I can't leave when the weather wrong I weather storms
She like Katrina got me looking for FEMA
Coveting my neighbor's lawn the grass is looking greener
But in reality it never is
I'm sure there's others, but I'll never find a better fish
Girls have feelings
Girls have feelings
Girls have feelings
They surely, surely do
(Verse)
I switch lanes; it's still blurry, then switch frames
Clowning these lames -- you're Bill Murray in Quick Change
Control your mission, keep up with my pole position
Brag it about the ride you're whipping, your soul is missing
Racing to your death or the holiest celebration
God bless our lady of holy accelerate
Cuz we speeding while we drive on this highway of information
The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation
They keep us at sea level so I’m staying on my A game
They local like the C when I express like the A train
My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain
We be alike and see alike, cause we got the same brain
We in the same chains, work in the same fields
Now we’re independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal
Total package, the flow is mastered, I'm blowing past the procrastinators
So fast, it's like they going backwards
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
(Verse)
They hate when I give 'em some straight they need chase
Half these little boys coming faster than speed racer
Pulling capers with my team best believe I’ll be seeing paper
With extraordinary gentlemen, trust me the league major
On the highway of life I’m faster than cop cars
Quicker than the tongues of the rappers that got bars
Never rattled cause we been through the battles, we got scars
This the international half of the Black Star
This is the sound that you’re missing I’m here when your ears listen
Play it loud in your whip when you're dippin your gear shifting
Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick.
Boys take over when the shit drop
Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Men wanna talk to the women, we ain’t screaming
Just whisper in their ear and we're leavin
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
(Bridge)
When it’s gone to the wire
I gotta win to the fire
You can’t stop it. No, you can’t stop it
Because I’m destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know it’s happening
At the time, get ready, set, go
(Verse)
On your mark, get set, when I start the jet
Look how far I get, I’m not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don’t exist, it’s a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market’s flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It’s so ironic, it’s beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don’t get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you’re tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That’s why I’m leaping the faith, keeping the pace
Although it’s all about the winning, it’s never about the wait
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
It's a brand new day
If you passionate about what you do like I'm passionate about this music
This song is for you
It's like I can't breathe
When I wake up in the morning I can't breathe
Until I listen
Feed my family
I affect the world
And y'all along for the ride

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I'm from a small city, but I have big dreams
Had some good ideas, but I had better schemes
I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stone
Until my partner died and name etched in stone
My daughter's growing up, my son on the way
They closing in on me, it feel like any day
Music saves me, swooped in like the navy
Put a lifetime of scars all in sixteen bars
So I took the vow and made music my life
Yep, I proposed and made music my wife
And if ever need to cut a nigga music's my knife
And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dyke
So if I degrade it and I hate it, even cried through it
I watch brothers prophesise about dying through it
Music gave me knowledge of self
And I'm a knowledge-ous self, then gave me knowledge of wealth

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

Music a part of me, I'm a bully
Beating up the track with brutal honesty
The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me
I'm using the inspiration guru provided me
The redefining of space, you can call me the new geometry
A picture of you pop up when I google monotony
Now all the people who rule and spend responsibly
Think your album is trash and it's not the voodoo economy
So you expecting the conscious and introspective views
Eat your lyrical vegetables, let me tell you what’s best for you
My music give you a message true and respect is due
But music is emotion that’s lost on the intellectuals
A tree fall in the forest is never heard
Amongst the sparrows and the robins and even the ghetto birds
You download it for free but what I create is sacred
It cost you nothing but I pay to make it, trust me

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I was born on the afterbeat
I'm like Robert Johnson
When you reach the crossroads
Me and the devil have to meet
It's all the same thing as clever Lauryn when they saw it Lauryn went
Looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin'
We listen to the same songs but we hear them different
Serenade of death like we got a fear of living
Having a seance on stage cause the spirit risen
Stop the devilish ways with clever displays of lyricism
These songs are a natural resources of actual street stories
Attract the police forces
Slaves to the rhythm the masters they eat off us
Remember, whatever discipline you’re in, whether you’re a musician or a photographer, a fine artist or a cartoonist, a writer, a dancer, a singer, a designer — whatever you do, you have one thing that’s unique: You have the ability to make art. Sometimes life is hard. Things go wrong — in life and in love and in business and in friendship and in health. And when things get tough, this is what you should do. Make good art

This about to be the realest shit you ever heard
I lynch rappers, got them hanging on my every word
These bitch rappers be claiming they slinging heavy word
Really snitch rappers, niggas singing like every bird
Rich rappers, nah, I don't know them niggas
Niggas don't get rich rapping, they selling clothes or liquor
My flow is sicker cause I flow with vigor
I'm no beginner, peep the whole agenda
Control my center cause I gravitate with Gravitas
This my inner monologue
Burning down your party cause our cocktails is molotov
My crime mob make you stop, lock and drop, don't get wollywop'd
Actually battery in my back like a copper top
Got it popping, started on the B-side of Body Rock
Direct to fan, I'm running my shop like my mom and pop
Modern day slavery today to be an artist, watch
They treat them like a product and try to mount like a hot 'n tot
Molly pop, niggas not caring if they body rot
Partying like Mardi Gras, get the cream like Häagen-Dazs
Golly gosh, this is Utopia, cornucopia
I'm known to start revolts against the Romans like Zenobia
Hoping to keep coping copious amounts of opiates
Tried to start a union, but they blocked me like a Soviet
I hope they get it, I'm sick of explaining history
I'm rolling with a circle of winners, we claimin' victories
It ain't a mystery, the hate'll make it bittersweet
They hate when I engage to debate 'em like Wale's Twitter feed
Who I'm kidding? I'm the great debater
My crew stay winning, we stay innovating
Your circle is rotten as great tomatoes
They get high with you then start dry snitching like Jose Canseco
Prosecco, I'm sipping vino with a vivid hue
Haberdasher rocking Borsalinos like Hasidic Jews
Pitiful, rappers never stand up to the ridicule
That's why I had to get at you
Wear it if it fit the shoe, nigga
(Baby, just shine your light
If you've gotta dim yours, so they can shine brighter
Just stay bright, so shine your light)

We're in a transitional world right now because the nature of distribution is changing. The distribution channels that people have built over the last century or so are in flux. The print, the visual artist, the musicians... which on the one hand intimidating and on the other, immensely liberating. The rules, the assumptions, the now-we're-supposed-tos  of how you get your work seen and what you do then, they're breaking down. The gatekeepers are leaving their gates. You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen. The old rules are crumbling. And nobody knows what the new rules are, so make up your own rules
Peace, peace, everything we do is a creation
In complete harmony, our creation becomes art
Everything we've ever invented stems from the human imagination
Everything we've ever invented or created
That moved an era is recognized as work of genius
Science and the empirical man, philosophy and the thinker
Religion and the shaman, art and the sick who can metabolize
Everything with a trace of decay is human error
Forgivable human error the curse
From the radiance of the gift which becomes shadow
Necessary evil so to speak, or we'd have figured it out by now
Striving for perfection is a result of genius
Find peace, share your genius
See I can't see my own face without a reflection
Whether it be your reaction to my expression, a mirror or water
I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
Through this understanding, I know that all things are one
According to science, everything is a wave of energy
A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
My eyes are receptors for another type of energy
Which my mind then depicts as images, same goes for smell and touch
Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
Now when given full attention to something other than time and space
Time and space disappear, I'm simply doing
Yesterday, tomorrow, here, there, poof!
It is always now, all is energy
Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
Technically I'm only a vessel channeling those thoughts
My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies
Which I either contemplate or share with the outside
I believe we all function with the same foundation
Energy, which is everything
Everything is one big ocean of energy
Everything is within you, everything is you
The identity of me is but a series of memories
In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
Remember it is always now
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
In other words, energy can neither be created or destroyed
Energy only transforms
We are thus forever, and death is but a blink
So I ask why hurt? Why kill? Why hate? Why fear? Why war?
Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself?
Can the state of the world change?
Can the state of the world change?
If energy only seems to transform then why not?
It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
A planet amongst other planets routing around the sun
In the same fashion as electrons do
Around the nucleus which form the cells, which form us
Ah yes, all is one, and my friends, it is beautiful
Let us unify our heart, now feel your power and I thank you
Peace and forever


Yeah, uh
Snap ya fingers, do ya step
Ayyy, where we at with it?
Where you at? Uh, uh
What era is this, man?

The era of the musical beautiful mistakes
Delivered hand to hand like we slangin' the mixtapes
You tryin' to describe us, you might as well get it straight
We the content creators, we greater than clickbait
The passion for the culture, the vultures they try to kill it
It's a war for your spirit, the lyrics is here to heal us
We looking for the fountain to keep us forever young
While I get my energy from the sun, all things are one
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongue
My color is my penalty mentally on the run
Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun, huh
Releasing blockages I ain't stoppin' until they gone
Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
Until I realized I can change what's going on (let's go!)
To every single place I go I'm right at home
I'm right at home (let's go!)
Waiting for that day to come, huh
Looking for fountains to keep us forever young
Get my energy from the sun
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongues
Every Sunday waking up catching gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all God's children, then what's the word of the reverend worth?
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in God's image then that means his face is mine
Wait, or it's that blasphemy it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally that's confusion to a young'n trying to follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was a Jew and not a Christian
Or that Christianity was made law by politicians
And who was King James? And why did he think that it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
They say Hell is underground, Heaven is in the sky
They say that's where you go when you die, but how they know?
I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons, that was a blessing not a curse
I found out that heaven and hell exist right here on earth, word
Studied with Rastafarians, found out from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and that's where the crazy boarheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real muslims believe in paradise and resisting Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
But when they say one's right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that ain't vain to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those that claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognize that life is full of miracles
You can see the flow is divine
I glow when I rhyme
Cause it coincide with a growing tide
Of those looking for God that know to go inside
Looking for absolution
Living in mass confusion
The gas inducing psychopath created a last solution
Based on his interpretation
Of what the words are saying
Looking for God but ended up doing the work of satan
Religion create division
Make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew
Make up rules of faith
That you condition to and gotta follow
God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever been to any ghetto, then you know it well
Peace
Gravitas, light it up
Lighten it up, brighten it up, yea
You want the grown step your bars up
You brag about the scrilla them killas lighten your cars up
Welcome to the complete history of the one known as Talib Kweli

Such a blessing, I'm making the bread leven
Descendant of Terra Firma I'm from the era of legend
The blind to my eyesight, too scared of the world ending
My men of spiritual essence be walking right into heaven
Ascending without the stairs, expressing without the fears
We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers
Unravelling minds, travelling through time like langoliers
Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier
In the park of Washington Square, locks in my hair
Louder than the bull horns we was locking 'em there
Cops would prepare to lock us up
They was scared like tales from the dark side
Summer of the Central Park five
1989 was the number, the year that I started rhyming
From Brooklyn to Staten Island them Decepticons was wildin'
Music soothing but the imagery violent as bomb threats
Therapy for the prison industrial complex
Provided the context for the crime with the TEC-9
At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine
I did it to death on my grind on a quest to get signed
Sorta like the tribe would always suggest we check the rhyme
An internal with Puff Daddy, in front of the buffed patio
Rolling with Hi Tek in the MPV through the streets of the 'Nati
Before graduating to Caddies was carrying crates
Shoutout to Flex all day doing records with John Forte
We was standing outside the tower devouring prey
Powerful display of bullet points that we shower and spray the block with
Back in them salad days these rappers was appetizers
I played it like I was David, I was tackling that Goliath
Attacking the open mics to the victory was decisive
This life it was so enticing, my surgery so precise
I would chop it like thin slices at parties we politic
At the country club, lighting up dutches with Pac and Big
At the crib of supernatural battling back and forth
Back before Jean was in the unsigned hype in the back of The Source
Rest in peace to Allah's sons, Shabba was liking to call you son
Cause you mine I call you son cause you shine
What's up Alyasha, this is OG Brooklyn shit
Not for impostors, pour out a shot of vodka for them
Big L, Big Poppa, Big Pun, 2Pac
The jungle is too savage, rap true master producing the new classic
This shit is too classic it's blow to  to spinal tap
I started with the Rawkus Recording we work the vinyl backwards
From DEF JUX to Loaded Lux
I'm the underground king like I'm rolling with Bun and 
The flow is nuts it's solid I got the golden touch
Plus my iron sheek and I got the game and the cobra clutch
This the highest caliber do the algebra
From Yasiin Bey to Jean Grey to Pharoahe Monch
Black Thought to Common
Almost 20 years after the release of Soundbombing
And it still sounds timeless
I'm out and on tour with the greatest, A Tribe Called Quest
And the De La's, opened for Jay Z and Nas, who else could say this?
In Vegas with Tech 9 getting faded before the gig
Only later to hit the RIO and hop on the stage with Prince
True story, I always knew the importance of great shows
Since 1992 I seen Ice Cube play Toads, way cold
Continue to pave the road for the Kendricks and J. Coles
Continue to stake gold
From making the way for Kanye to meetings with Mr. Harry Belafonte
All started on park benches with Dante
Predicting the future, so observant I'm clairvoyant
The frame can't contain it, I'm painting a rare portrait
Yeah! Come on! What it is
It's the P-l-a-n-e-t R-o-c-k
Kweli, BK, c'est la vie
You could tell I be hell-a-free like college radio
WQHT gonna play me though
This hot shit is to fly like the cockpit
Got spit like a french kiss chicks lock lips
Coming from the deep black like the Loch Ness
Now bring apocalypse like the heart of darkness
It's like the heart of the artist become a target
Pop music is the black market
Recently we witness bizarre shit
The war hit the same time as SARS hit
Terrorists send bombs at the concert
The show must go on yo regardless
I'm just some hip-hop kid to pop shit
And get on some rock shit and start a mosh pit

Yeah
We got the beat to make the planet roooccccckkk
(Come on, Come on)
Yeah, Come on
We got the beat to make the planet rooocccckkkk
(Come on, Come on)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We got the planet to rock, Kweli's standing on top
I'm like a panther when I answer to cops
And bust back before the man get a shot
And the blood on their veins run cold like the cannibal lox
And bring heat like the blood of the mammal that's hot
And keep fighting like the boy with the mechanical heart
And watch time count down on the hands of the clock
Till the hour when the pinnacle start
Wow, and go fast like the bullet that ran through the dark
The hollow tip ripped a man apart, blaow
Yo these soldiers die in petroleum wars
Think they fighting for the holliest cause
It don't matter if you Muslim, Hebrew, or you a Christian
Information is the newest religion, is a true way of living
Ain't no rule to a surpestition stop me with going through with my mission
Come on man


Come on get down, get down, get down, get down
Go ladies, go, go, go ladies, go, go
Come on all my ghetto people stand strong
We rocking on and on
One for me, now rocking with the best and is Kweli
You ain't no MC like me, you just a clone like KFC
Come on, B-Boys, B-Girls, we rocking the world


Don't belive niggas running the place
Man everything is dangerous nothing is safe, nigga
Think you a man with a gun in your waist
Let the cops disrespect you right in front of your face
Take it out on your girl, punch her in the face
You ain't a thug you a waste of space
Nigga get out the way, B-boys gonna rock till the break!
How much can a planet take
(Repeat until end)
We got the beat...
Oh yeah
That’s the universal language right there
The have nots, vs the have

Growing up, sure was tough
When the money, getting to slowing up
A promise is hard as trying to do to knowledge
When you don’t know enough
Poor enough to notice
But you pour it up, and you throw it up
They say that when they comin'
But we ain't runnin', nobody as cold as us
My life is like a play
But I don’t grace stages
Try to feed my family, but it’s hard on these slave wages
Lucifer behind me, crucify me like a god suh
They never want to pay us, but immigrants get the job done
Job one is self-preservation
I gotta stay healthy
The system always favors the riches, make sure they stay wealthy
How they gon' stop it, if education for profit
The prophets make revelations
The gangsters go in your pockets
I’m stocking up on these favors, cause vagrancy never fly
They value people for they paper
Like animals for they hides
And the battle cry, is that there’s value in our lives
Spirituality over money is where our power lies

Mon cœur je dois partir
Je sais c'est difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne t'en fais pas pour moi
J'allumerai chaque soir
Des étoiles dans le ciel
Papa sera bientôt là
Reste ici, attends-moi

The attitude they employ say it all
It’s just aristocratic
Fascist police’ll murder people who give em static
They’ll make a cheap version of smack
And sell that shit to addicts
Systematic or incidental that shit is just as tragic
I’m just emphatically and dramatically overwhelmed fam
No job, no money, no safety net, no health plan
No car, no home, no food on the table
No way to provide for my people
Though I’m willing and able to
To pry off government assistance
Cause a feeling’ll enable you
Where pride ain't practical when you lacking that capital
Holes in my clothes, this was never a fashion show
Too broke for the sour roll
But that don’t matter though
Talk is cheap, I had enough of the back and forth
I’m on the verge, snapping out
Trying to laugh it off
I love to work for myself
‘Cause is sucks when you have a boss
But I least I have a job, no one is promised to have it all
I’m in the rat race; pick up the phone when the cattle call
Spitting these tree songs, keep calm like Adderall

Mon cœur je dois partir
Je sais c'est difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne t'en fais pas pour moi
J'allumerai chaque soir
Des étoiles dans le ciel
Papa sera bientôt là
Reste ici, attends-moi
Hey Y'all
I feel good right? (mmm...hmmm...)
Yeah, ok, uhh..
Now what that make me talk about?
Love, love, love, love...(echoes)
Yeah, that's what the world need, ha
Yo, that's what your girl need
All right, we gon' put it down like this
I'll tell you about myself

My name is Kweli and I love to spit it homie
I rap about love and life, ladies get to know me
If you feelin' lonely, I can be your one and only
I put it out in the world, so people show me... love (echoes)
Yeah, I always get it back
This ain't no pimp game here, that's a different track
We talkin' this and that, we need to get with this
I keep it realer than most, this is our business

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on
Wanna tell the world if they don't know
That what we have is real
Wanna shout it from the mountains baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

Yo, hey baby look like you need a break tonight
Let me make it right, baby won't you stay the night
I got a lot of love as you know you're my favorite right?
Hey my lady, what we gon' make tonight (our love...)
That's the dream, but I never sleep
Across the crowded room, our eyes forever meet
But without doubt and gloom, cuz we can never be
That's why I got to go, cuz you're my impossible love
You're the horizon I can see but never ride off into
I write my lyrics to you, you the perfect instrumental
I sound better than the cat who rappin' to you now
That's between me and you, what happened to us now?
Got you hopin' for the glorious
Waitin' for that victorious feelin' wanted by all of us
Kneelin' and praying that the lord in us will help us love ourselves
So much that the confidence attract to someone else


Yo, Rockin' Los Angeles, House of Blues in Sunset
Performin' like an orgasm, my girl ain't even cum yet
Seen her by the side of the stage givin' me energy
Potentially, wife material connectin' mentally
I felt like heaven sent for me, you're meant for me
The doubters and the haters had to acknowledge eventually
You was a non-believer too if memory serves
And a heart that gives shit, tryin' to play your boy for the her
The harder that I run to you, the farther you become
It's like my heart was part of some movie that hadn't yet begun
This woman moves me and I'm a mountain of a man
You pull me in like the waves do the grain of sand (love, love, love...)
Yeah, I love the way you bring it to me
I wrote a song for you, I love to hear you to sing it for me
And let the melody carry me through the jealousy
And we can cruise like Tom and Penelope
 x4
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya

I'mma start this story, my influence so enormous
Got that shit you love to sing along with
Like every line is the chorus
I'm born in Brooklyn like Biggie
I'm born in Brooklyn like Jordan
I'm born in Brooklyn like Tyson
You don't live this, you just a tourist
We ride or die for them corners
Fuck your private life they spy on us
When they catch us man it's like practice
For the new tactics that they try on us
Them cops are lining them coffers
Why we get shot we lying in coffins
They want my demise cause when I arrive they stop for lines so often
Nigga just stop, you might as well forfeit
We like Shia LaBeouf so lawless
Still recognize real, still recognize real
Like the car I'm driving you foreign
My diamond cut so flawless
No not jewels I'm talking bout songs bitch
So if they after me like I'm Lauryn
I tell the feds that I'm moorish
We walking, all the girls is talking
Generally they butt fucking naked just like the Book of Mormon
We see the trees for them forest
My name ring them bells like a doorman
Y'all niggas game is so corny
That's why you grill them hoes just like Forman, boring
 x4

Paper chasing we on that grind
Reputation on the line
Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time
Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time
Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time
Explore and discover what most fear
I will never wait til the brush clear
Swear I will never get stuck here
America, fuck yea
Measure my career in dog years
My passport got them dog ears
I set sail, travelling the world like Jesus was doing in his lost years
I might give you the pill like Morpheus
I'm like the P.E. logo in the cross hairs
Standing out cause there's nothing but whores here
Pimps rock crocodile like false tears
Bring it on through your force field
I'll be giving you nothing but the raw deal
What I say on display is the purest skill
I'll be giving y'all niggas what's more real
What's more real, what's more real?
I got chicks fighting like floor sales
You gossiping bloggers all fail
Look at the yardstick measuring your tall tales
And you on all fours you small scale
All in between the legs like a dog's tail
You are what you eat, you don't want no beef
You completely vegan like all kale
 x6
Let me holler at you

Can I talk to you?(x5)

I want you, cuz you make my heart skip the beat that I drum to
I want to be the one you run to, when pain confronts you
You're everything, sometimes I get nervous when I'm in front you
You can hear it in my voice when I ask you if you comfortable
Look how love do
I'd practice the Art of War for you like Sun Tzu
Come through and arouse you every morning like the sun do
If you blackout and collapse I want to help you to come to
Notice I haven't yet got into what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through and make you shine like the sun do
I want you to be the valley for my river to run through
You're everything, you send your soul through your lips to my heart
Sweet music will start I want you to be the muse for my art
When people try to rip us apart we got to work to stay together
Go through the seasons of love and never change with the weather
This is my wish list, what I want not what I need there's a difference
These days I'm learning that words got power so I'mma be specific
Word

Can I have a talk with you?
Can I make a dream come true?
Can I be in love with you?
Cuz I would if I could

Yeah sunflower
You must live in the infinite blackness that exists when I close my eyes
I see you when I fall asleep, I see you when I dream

Lil' darlin'
Set your soul on fire (lil' darlin')
Be your one desire (lil' darlin')
Lil' darlin'
Can I talk to you? (lil' darlin')
Lil' darlin', lil' darlin'
Can I talk? (lil' darlin')
Can I talk, can I talk, can I?
Lil' darlin' (lil' darlin')
Can I talk to you? (lil' darlin')
Let him talk to you
Set your soul on fire
