Do you still believe in love?
Or do you like drugs?

Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it though, she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe, Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend, damn they was close
Let's reunite, let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though
She be gettin' too eager, ho
Stamp it like it's my visa
Cheefin' off of these berries
When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary, Fiend

It's lit, feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?

She take me to a place that I never would discover
Might never have another, so I had to fuck her
Reach into my pockets, damn I ain't got a rubber
See my nigga Ron like L. Ron Hubbard, he be outta space
Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say "Boy you got it made
Do you got a cape?", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait?
I'm quite impatient, intoxication got me feelin' like procreating
Girl I'm the baker, you surely caking
Stand back, catch my amazing graces
Photo finish and fornication
Photo finish and fornication, fiend

It's lit, feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?

Feel the buzz
Can you feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz, ohh-whoa, yeah
Do you believe in love?
What's your drug? What's your drug?
Ohh-whoa

Take it all the way from the beginning
Yea, yea, yea
Now comes the question of which intro do you use?
Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on?
But, then that lets people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that...

You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, uhm world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
We was 15 with a ASR up in my house
Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin'
He made it rappin', now at the shows he the main attraction
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?
(It's lit, feel the buzz?)
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?
That's deep

Feel the buzz?
It's lit, feel the buzz?
Feel the buzz?
I won't let it out until you let me know if you love it
Aye, baby, I'mma take it low

I'm on my night job, my niggas riding my city understand us
See a hundred bandits, each put a hundred bands up
They can't call us bandits no more
Same hood, same corner store
But them same old hoes ain't wearing panties no more
I'm on my night job, slim waist with them fat thighs
Never been baptized, but she soak me all in her holy water
I'm one of five, she the only daughter—she ain't used to sharing
I ain't used to caring, let's play truth or dare
'Cause lately my lifestyle's like dynamite
I'mma go lights out like Dyna might
Smoke one, that I might—I'm on my night job
Always knew how to play these cards of mine
Fuck rap, we seen harder times
Jump back like Vinny Carter prime
I'm on my—

I won't let it out until you let me know if you love it
Aye, baby, I'ma take it low

I'm on my night job, y'all niggas jivin', I'm back up in position
Earnhardt, I'mma catch some nigga slippin'
Burn hard on a track and get to whippin'
I'm on my night job, why is it always blacks that get detention?
For my nigga with the pass to get the flip in
Boy, that trap is a accurate description
I'm on my night job, finally got Bassy off the corner
'010 niggas thought he was a goner
He ducked shots, now it's "Bas we got a phoner"
I'm on my night job, flew the posse out to Rome and
Won't tell you 'bout no Bo$$-Key-Yacht$, don't want 'em
Nigga, word to Selassie I, I'm zonin'
I'm on my night job

Got old niggas tryna bite cause they can't capture
The feeling from days 'fore the game passed 'em
Niggas out here lookin' like a bunch of Dame Dashes
Nicorette, that's patchwork
That ain't better than your last work
Cigarette, let the ash burn
Omen said don't worry 'bout the last word
I'ma hit the gas, swerve on 'em—Skrr!

Too high to riot, that's my best excuse for being lazy
Being an artist, that's the best excuse for being crazy
I've been so infatuated, went to Clark and graduated
Now she on my face time and, my nigga, she just masturbated

Fuck a album release party, I'm out in the streets, shawty
How many rappers I killed—counted at least forty
Nah, I ain't God, but shawty down on her knees for me
I'm horny like that Coltrane album
A Love Supreme, that's cold-fame album
Lately, I've been dancing like a Soul Train album
Lately, silly making songs talkin' 'bout how they hate me
They've been loving me this whole time
My only adversary was my own mind
Killed my ego now I'm snappin' like it's '09
With a gold mine of inspiration for y'all
Fuck your co-sign, that nigga can't fuck with Cole neither
Don't ask for a feature, we bring a whole liter of ether
To eat ya, we got heat for niggas, keep reachin'
If these bullets was heat seeking
They wouldn't even reach you niggas
I'm on my...
My nigga just made bail
My nigga just made bail

My nigga just made bail
I just came up, On some grey 12's
Great health, cheers to that
Do this shit for Queens got my ears to that
They hate us but, not more they hate theyselves
I guess that they gotta motivate theyselves
We can never correlate, you will never see my plane
Right in front of you but your vision is so plain
I see it more vivid, seen it all, did it
Round these fake fucks still keep it authentic, granted
Give or take fucks, how your measures rate us
Damnit, you'll never understand it
And even though I'm so lit
I've seen the cards handed and I replayed mine
Hell yeah I'm on tilt
But I'm never off handed, gotta keep good time

Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you
Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you

My nigga just made bail
My nigga just made bail
My nigga just made bail
My nigga just made bail

Listen when you get a blessin you don't ask why
You just pass forward, and fast forward
All my niggas from the hood got a passport
And them girls already know we ain't ask for it
Said she from the hood but her ass foreign
Drive a Malibu but her gas foreign
Her aspirations I can't relate with
But I'm like a ghost cause my ass tourin
Burn holes in all my clothes
But I got merch and this cash for it
Glass floors and no ceilings
How I wish we could both feel it
For all the ones gone cause I miss your breathing
Any y'all saw came any y'all part
Gotta race cars
Penny my thoughts, nah this shit premium
Bas

Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you
Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you

My nigga just made bail
My nigga just made bail
My nigga just made bail
My nigga just made bail

And everything'll follow, got to
Free your mind and everything'll follow, gotta
Free your mind and everything'll follow, gotta
Free your mind and everything'll ... Cole

My nigga just made bail
Tell the good Lord, we gon raise hell
We gon pop off, like a fake nail
Take the top off and get ill get ill get
My nigga just made bail
Tell the fuckin mayor he got hate mail
Less shakedowns and more Shakespeare
Please, all these niggas don't care
Prepare for the new shit, that Cole is the truth shit
Nigga this is Lu shit, nigga this is Bas shit
Meaning this some true shit, telling you shit
Bout the crew, how we do shit, who sick?
And, tell my niggas in the two-six in the coupe
I'mma kick back smoke a pool stick
This for my new chick tryin get fit say she too thick
Ain't no such thing as too thick, what you wanna be a toothpick?
What you wanna get your cooch licked?
Well I'm tryna get my flute played
If we the new slaves
I am Frederick Douglass of rhetoric ahead the the others
You motherfuckas better get free
This for that insecure girl, your name I won't mention
On Instagram straight flickin'
Bitch you a nipple slip away from strippin'
Might as well, get your clientele up, you a pioneer
Them girls fuck for free, I'm never buying there
Save that shit for the D.R
I rock crowns and these niggas rock tiaras or tiaras
'Cause I'm Pete Carroll, left college and I fucked the pros up
Guess it ain't luck when the luck just shows up
Like every verse on the spot, shit is never rehearsed
You heard it first, Bas

My I swear to God, Cole world
We doin' it out here, in the UK fool!
Y'all ain't ready, I got Bas the Genius over there
I got DJ Dummy downstairs
I swear to God we doing this shit
We gon' take on the world

Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you, won't you
They putting prices on heads, silver or lead
I pray the scores settle 'fore the devil notice you dead
Got me smoking the potent, my eyes open and Otis, they red
Thoughts of my eye roam and words that I hoped I had said
That aunty sippin on, we missin ya
Even tho you gone, your thought alone can lift us up
This is us
Got some niggas never call me 'less they need something
But I pick up, like, "whassup, what you need cousin?"
My niggas know that I love 'em
Give 'em roses while they can smell 'em
Cause ain't no tellin' who'll be here tomorrow
Used to borrow your digital scale
Flippin' them sales
But now it's digital dash while you're still in the past
Boy, trust me when I tell you, the picture got much bigger
The swishers and dutch fill up
Bitches in lust with us
Momma would dissapprove, losing my way
Lost in the sauce, this bolognese is so amazing
Had a talk and she remark: "you so engaging"
Running game, it's all the same
I'm growing jaded
Had a couple things in common, like Lonnie Lynn
But I'm too faded for conversatin'
I'm sittin' here contemplatin' how to win
(x2)
Time keeps slipping away, away
Another day another love song, hey
Another day another love song, hey

Yeah
Cousin in jail again, asking me for bail again
Close when I was 12, but I was much frailer then
He was like 16, a nigga from the gutter and
Years ago his favorite uncle had married my mother and
Here we are, runnin' through the Ville like dumb and dumber and
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then
Well time passed and we fell off cause you moved back home
Little did you know Jermaine done grew a new back bone
Niggas thought he wouldn't make it 'till he proved that wrong
12 years later on the radio that Who Dat song
Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now you buggin'
Cause you looking at the cover and you say "Yo that's my cousin"
And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasn't
Next thing I know you blowing up my line all a sudden
And I'm showing love saying "yo look what I did
Man, nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big"
But now you saying "Man enough about you
Shit what about me, my nigga what about me?
Oh you forgot about me?"
Same niggas showed you how to rap, now you don't know how to act
Boy I'm at the bottom you could pull a nigga out of that
Put me in a video, yo put me on your hottest track
Bring me on the road with you, you know 'cuz got yo back
And I'm strapped up if them niggas act up
See you headed to the top you need to let me catch up
Please let me catch up
Won't you let me catch up man"
"I'll see you when I see you
Harsh as it seems to say, I wouldn't want to be you
Bail you out for your daughter and I pray to God
A nigga never pull your card or she won't ever get to see you"
Got a whole tank of dopamine, flush it
You're only as low as you think, fuck it
Your never as low as you think, nah, nah, man your never as low as you think

A moment of silence with words that he heard on the phone
Strapped up just like a Platoon, won't find no Oliver Stone
He had four brothers when he was 16 and my nigga now all of them gone
I break a pound of that loud, I smoke it all on my own

Look, I'm at work like fuck it man
I might flip and tell my manager to suck it man
Whats two hundred dollars a week
I got a bunch of fam
Got aunties, got my brother, my sister, my father, my mother
Plus I got Uncle Sam
And this mop ain't the only thing right in this bucket man
But back to mopping like fuck it man
Know I got a lot things coming man
I know a lot of niggas doubt but they don't understand that
Ain't no limits to what God can prove
They told me this life wasn't logical and I showed my niggas it was possible
Like fuck an obstacle cause this wasn't even in the plan
And now I notice what I got to do
And I'm not just going to shine I'ma blind you too

Got a whole tank of dopamine, flush it
You're only as low as you think, fuck it
Your never as low as you think, nah, nah, man your never as low as you think
Got a whole tank of dopamine, flush it
You're only as low as you think, fuck it
You're never as low as you think, nah, nah, man your never as low as you think

Shit, cause I ain't rich enough
I mean my father got a whip but ain't sick enough
My mother need treatment like she ain't been sick enough?
My cousin need treatment like she ain't been sick enough?
My God I mean before I die give me everything required to die knowing I did enough
And my niggas well, they can never drink enough
Let me get a couple bottles get 'em liquored up
Young kings in the city so we feast like the royals, sleepless
The city the only teacher, the snakes in retreat
Don't retreat thats a coil
Straight from police they will seek and destroy you
Nigga no pirates, homie I got lockships
I go Loch Ness on these fuck niggas, can't fuck with us
They all boxed in, might circle round and dump shots in
See Cole, he might pop in and go beast mode
The new East Coasts, them Queens niggas to them Ville niggas gone speak for it
Niggas know it, I feel at home in like every city
Rock big body like 750
My bitch body like Heaven pick me
I'm winning nigga, I'm winning nigga, I'm

Got a whole tank of dopamine, flush it
You're only as low as you think, fuck it
Your never as low as you think, nah, nah, man your never as low as you think
Got a whole tank of dopamine, flush it
You're only as low as you think, fuck it
Your never as low as you think, nah, nah, man your never as low as you think

A moment of silence with words that he heard on the phone
Strapped up just like a  Platoon
Won't find no Oliver Stone, he had four brothers when he was 16 and my nigga now all of them gone
I break a pound of that loud, I smoke it all on my own

Never mix soil in blood, but I still call them my own
I call them my own, I know that's my own
Never mix soil in blood, but I still call them my own
I call them my own, I know that's my own
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along

Good things don't happen to good people
People never change
Pupils dilate my frame
Make my vision so exquisite
While my cousin dead and gone
I can't wait to go and visit
Father time, don't deny me
I just need a couple minutes
Exercise my better nature
I've been holding up these bridges
Nigga's always take advantage
Olive branches start to splinter
Giving way, withering, turning colder than the winter
And my city, but the center feels no pity, this for me, this for me
I'm just reaping what I sow
And I've been sewing for my nigga's in the snow
Let them know that I be sewing
Never slow to know your pain
I'll be back before you know it
Left the town a drug dealer
Came back a fucking poet
Let me grow

I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
Lone

Last week I bought a testing kit, I wish they made em for people
The way these nigga's be actin they should be cast in a sequel
Nigga's phony they only give you dap just to reach you
I know ain't the first homie to have to tackle these issues
Hov told me D'evils
Got the best of him then, they get the best of me now
Without a Reasonable Doubt
When nigga's acting irrational, hard to reason it out
I had to kick down the doors, I had to leave a few out
Door mat

I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
'Lone

That's ok
My bitches know I'm a fiend
But that's ok
They just love me for me
They just love me for me
(methylone)

I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
'Lone
I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
'Lone
Said I'm calling all my niggas with me riding
Dressing room like we keep bitches on the rider
Bus full of white girls singing Akinyele
Momma I think I just met me a Madonna
Everything glowing ain't a diamond
I know everything glowing ain't a diamond
Girl you shining

But I ain't felt love in a long time, and I  told you that when we woke up
I guess that might have been the wrong time
My best pick up line is young nigga with  money, I ain't playing
My best pick up line is young nigga with money

Killing these niggas, I got a feeling these niggas is out to get me but trust me I got 'em
Straight out the borough my city love me we thorough
My nigga you don't want none of them problems
She acting crazy she calling me baby I just be feeding them bitches the bottles
She live in way up in Harlem but she come to me when I call her
And she all about her fashion she be working for Vogue
Me I'm all about my stacking I be working the road

But them clouds never get old
Them clouds never get old

So focused on, make the dopest song
Got this chick open on, got her lit on patron
Got her ticked off, cause I got no tick for her
I got no time, but I got some dick for her now
She was lit, I was milk
Girl don't let that milk spoil
You got some friends that stress you
He ain't loyal, I got some friends, don't let 'em think for you now
Pull up the whip for you now, here go the town
I am no pimp, but I am a player
You not with the shits? I'll talk to you later
I'm playing girl I got a thing for you now

But I ain't felt love in a long time, and I told you that when we woke up
I guess that might have been the wrong time
My best pick up line is young nigga with  money, I ain't playing
My best pick up line is young nigga with money

718 to your state, 212 to your city
My best pick up line is young nigga with  money, I ain't playing
718 to your state, 212 to your city

Throwing fishing nets in the ocean to cash
Good catch, here's to hoping it last, nigga
And bring them hoes back to the pad from the show
But only if they know how to act, nigga
Don't ever get stuck on your laurels like
All of them stuck in the past niggas
Shit, it's how I got past niggas
For real

Said I'm calling all my niggas with me riding
Dressing room like we keep bitches on the ride up
Bus full of white girls singing Akinyele
Momma I think I just met me a Madonna
We ain't buyin' none of that
None of that

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives
Pockets is full of the hope homie
Tell 'em we came for the dope only
For the dope only
Benjamin Franklins them folks owe me

Word to Soulo my nigga
I got the loud and it's lit
Went to college a bit
Pissed off my scholarship quick
Now I'm back in the town
I'm back in the town

A nigga been searching for purpose, there's nothin' around
Back in there makin' my old moves, wrong move
Play the game and nigga no rules, poor you
You could probably lose your soul too, dancing with the devil
The seeds were planted back in '02
I guess I learned my lesson
Cause now a nigga at the O2, London on tilt
With the G's, ballin' like we watch film
If you talking Queens, nigga please
Them niggas reaching, we sould put em on stilts
I know we cool and all but cool it y'all, they pullin' off him
My nigga who are y'all? Don't get my crew involved

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like housewives
Pockets is full of the hope homie
Tell 'em we came for the dope only
For the dope only
Benjamin Franklins them folks owe me
And we ain't about none of that shit
And we ain't about none of that shit
And we ain't about none of that shit
(You niggas just talking the most like housewives)

Millions soldiers get a re-deployment
Cause ain't no leader here that we appointed
We the only one's that matter now
Cut the chatter down
Fuck your style, this ain't dappered down
Wear my own shit, still hittin' bitches like it's batter round
Call me spring training
I've been whiling but I'm maintaining
Young burrow Bassy
Dawg, whole borough watch me
Fiends, boys from the block
But we got hoes in the lobby
A tree grows from the concrete
Like he rose to the top
Cocky, them boys finna flop
But not me, your boy been alive
Bas

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives
Pockets is full of the hope homie
Tell 'em we came for the dope only
For the dope only
Benjamin Franklins them folks owe me
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
(You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives)

Word to Soulo my nigga
I got the loud and it's lit
Went to college a bit
Pissed off my scholarship quick
Now I'm back in the town
I'm back in the town
A nigga been searching for purpose
There's nothin' around
I can't see love
I can't see love lately
I can't see love
I can't see love lately
I can't see love
I can't see love lately
I can't see love
I can't see love lately

Lately I got this feeling
My niggas is meant to get it
It's written up in the stars
Made it from slimmer odds when only God was with us
Fuck it nigga we did it, been picking the game apart
My response for critics is spitting it from the heart
Ain't no frontin' involved
They feel it, I'm 'bout to make niggas fold
Something in the water got me floating like the work across the border
Girl I wonder how we making it home?
I'm no angel, I got an angle
Back to the crib, bitch I'm tryna get you naked and bone
She's no angel, but with the blow she's a snow angel
The dangers of taking her home
She said, "You caught my eye and my ears
You speak sincere, write precise
Cross your t's and dot your i's
See my fears and read my mind
If lawyers steal and doctors lie
What's really left for you and I?
(What's really left for you and I?)"
Trust, shit I don't know too much about it
We can take this leap of faith

But I don't wanna feel the bottom, no
I don't wanna feel the bottom, no
Girl I don't wanna feel the bottom
I don't wanna feel the bottom, no
Girl I don't wanna feel the bottom

And I just called up my mama, she missing her son
I've been pulling all-nighters and missing the sun
I heard it gets addicted to some
The bigger the light, the quicker they come
They exit your life, just as quick as they come
I'm numb to it like a brick to the gums
I get to it, just as quick as it comes
As quick as it comes now
I wish niggas wasn't so addicted to power
I wish heaven had visiting hours
I wish we could hit the Ave like we used to
Dime, nickel, 20 bag like we used to
Ride with my dawgs, moving cross the States
Die by my word, that's an author's fate
So how your shoulders holding up fine, great?
I got the weight of the world on mine, I'm straight
Now pay your dues til your dues paid
Play your role til your role change, nigga rotate
'Rari or Jaguar, switching forth lanes
Call me for NASCAR, Bassy a track star
Gassin' the track like I'm running propane
Lapping these niggas and jealousy's a bitch
Made it out the city, look around
I brought all my niggas with me
And I gotta thank God for the felonies we missed
Gotta thanks mom dukes, gotta thanks pops too
They say anything possible
My squad like apostles, believe in me
Don't know how to quit, that's a fiend to me
Yeah, my niggas flood proof
Pray for the rain, gotta deal with mud too
Gotta deal with slugs who
Lay six feet, try to get above you
My niggas flood proof
Pray for the rain, gotta deal with mud too
Gotta deal with slugs who
Lay six feet, try to get above you
They love you
And hug you, they sing your praises
They wear their faces backwards
Still I see 'em acting
Just the walking reenactment
Ain't nothin' real about 'em
Niggas talk about us
Spill they're heart up out us
They spill they're hearts
But what's her name again?
We talking 'bout lames again
Won't pretend I'm entertained
I'm staying sane
I'm going through the changes
I'm still the same
Everybody feel you, don't feel your pain
Go on, go on, still I, hold on to you
Go on, go on, still I, hold on

Cause I don't wanna feel the bottom, no
I don't wanna feel the bottom
Said I don't wanna feel the bottom, no
I don't wanna feel the bottom

I can't see love
I can't see love lately
I guess the lights that been shining a lot brighter
Let's have a drink with the girls from the videos

If I wasn't preoccupied, self-absorbed, yourself alone
I left you with, I got the world
Still felt alone and ever since been lost in the stars
Missing on what Heaven sent godly
I'm faulty, I'm fraud maybe
Probably was the reason that your dog hate me
But fuck that bitch like the law baby
Girl, I'm just playing but I'm off though
We should grab a drink before we link up at the crossroad
Pick it all apart
"Don't be tickling my heart," you'd say
"I was with you from the start," you'd say
"I really thought you did it for the art," you'd say
I guess the lights that been shining a lot brighter
Let's have a drink with the girls from the videos
I must have been through this one 'til my past life
I see the pitfalls, dodging the difficult

Rolling down the slippery slope, stay on point I tippy toe it
Won't you smile it gives me hope
Pray that you forgive me for it
Rolling down the slippery slope, stay on point I tippy toe it
Won't you smile it gives me hope
Pray that you forgive me for it

You understand?
Can't remember last night a nigga under Xans
My haters I lost sight can't see 'em under Bans
My niggas yell, "let's ride" they see I got a plan
Me I understand, I just understand it
I pray to God when I see how far we've come
Tears of joy I think we could drown the sun
And let that marijuana twist up
Put me right up in the lineup never been sub
I'm next up never mind when we get snubbed
They getting Michael Jordan, Harold Miner mixed up
We gone show 'em that Dreamville this year
We gone show 'em that when the people come together ain't no holding back
And that's the only fact
I been holding back tears for these young black souls lost in the past year
Some by the law, they ain't even flash steel
Some by they own dogs, most by their own fears
And you can watch it all young nigga stand still
Niggas yelling 100, they ain't half real
Fuck a line in the sand, I put a line on the dot and leave you right where you stand, and I'm just trying to understand

Rolling down the slippery slope, stay on point I tippy toe it
Won't you smile it gives me hope
Pray that you forgive me for it
Rolling down the slippery slope, stay on point I tippy toe it
Won't you smile it gives me hope
Pray that you forgive me for it

Been there before, lust in my eye
Times in the past
Drowning my sorrows, my fears speaking louder
In my head getting louder
I'm holding on tight darling
The roots to places I found
I'm closing my eyes closed
Now, I'm back with you in my mind
Girlfriend
Want you to be
Girlfriend

Reached into my mind for reflection
The truth is obscuring my perception
So take a hit on this shit feel the resin on our fingertips
And watch it billow, billow, let it go
Reached into my mind for reflection
The truth is obscuring my perception
So take a hit on this ship filled with resin on our fingertips
And watch it billow, billow, let it go

Schedule that freely, you can pick a day
We can roll em up and roll em up
So I can watch everything ricochet

Six months since I last seen you
Clip blunts in them ash trays
While we speak up on them past days
You know I still have faith
It's been ten months since I last seen you
Clip blunts in them ash trays
While we speak up on them past days
You know I still have faith
You know I still have faith

Schedule that freely, you can pick a day
We can roll em up and roll em up
Sit back and watch everything ricochet
Schedule that freely, you can pick a day
We can roll one up and roll one up
So I can watch everything ricochet
(Reached into my mind
Reached in, reached into, to my, to my mind
Let it, let it)

Innocence lost, it's never retained
It's never the same, it's never the same
Leave this world with some inspiration
I'll take the bait before a pure of gold
Come to grips with your intuition
Hear the whispers of your soul
Steer you down the road you're on
It's all your own
Innocence lost, it's never retained
It's never the same, it's never the same
Leave this world with some inspiration
I'll take the bait before a pure of gold
Come to grips with your intuition
Hear the whispers of your soul
Steer you down the road you're on
It's all your own
Got them speakers in my ride
I like to keep 'em bumpin'
I'm hustling, chasing dreams
In hopes that I could become something
I threw a party, she say Bassy, thank you, but it's nothin'
Cause I had to keep it jumpin'
Ya a'int  Blake Griffin, but I know that you be jumpin'
Poker face stiffin', but I know that you be bluffin'
No, I don't be cuffin', all these ducks be gettin' ends
Rubber duck etcaeterin', and I'm the pain
I left to make, and can't be ya crutch and meta...

Piffy lined up, fired up in the dutch
Or the EZ Widers, slide up, six speed
Like clutch, the city on me, I'm clutch
No Worries they depending on me, I'm clutch
Toast up mimosas at thirty thousand feet
Henny in hand, land, can make it out my seat
Michelin man, making grip up out the street
Grab The D cup on the freak, played that bitch and press repeat
J-Walkin' thru time zones, I'm on that trip
Got yo piece of the pie, and you pawn that shit
I'm takin' all that shit until I own that sis
College shit get mind blown, I'm on that quick
She got expensive addiction and a nose that's rich
Nothin' betta than brown dough that's on that stick
A lil' hashish, shiish, baby
If you roll it up with some keif, Super Mook
Super Mook chasin paper 'bout my loose leaf
Rollin papers yeah I do chief
Meditatin' like I'm Bruce Lee, at the Carter like I'm Tunechi
Riddin' thru the borough while this cutie feed me sushi
Salmon, avocado and an order of the cuchie
Charles De Gaulle to JFK
Brods givin up the draws like I'm JFK
Guess I'm flawed, after all, ain't nobody perfect
Do it all just to ball and the shit is worth it
Fiend

It's like that now
Quick, fuck that let me get back

I'm in L.A. but my Jays got sand from Dubai
I'm getting brains all day like I'm Magna Cum Laude
Cause, while you boys planked I was getting more stamps
Now my passport shitting on your whole camp
Fuck ya Instagram, that monkeys do delivery, that instant gram
Damn, put them ones up for them ones that's above us cause we miss them man
And to the niggas stuck up in the can
And slam a cage up in ya body put cha body up in a different plan
Different plain
Same hustle different game
They don't love you if they always wanted you to stay the same
Slidin' through the 'jects, now I'm slidin' through the W with different dames
That's a W nigga figure that shit is game
I just keep doubling figures until my niggas ain't
Pedelin' pills and kaine
Cause in the streets, or the industry man them presidents still the same

Them presidents still the same
I get that green back
I see stacks and relapse
Fiend Bas, I mean that
I need that
I'm too high to riot, I'm too high to riot
I'm just too high to riot

I never lose sight
Got an eye on her thighs and an eye on horizons
Too much at stake, got no time for a date
Unless that date is with fate, got my eyes on the prize and
Its too occupant, you want a slice but it's too hot just pie it
You want a steak but it's too high to buy it
Me I be too high, I'm too high, I'm too high
I'm too high for games and I'm too high for liars
Fuck TSA cause I'm too high for flying
Fuck NSA cause them satellites too high. they do all the spying
Fuck all the leaders that's too high off power
They do all the lying and treat us like prisoners
I mean who is the enemy here?
You are or I am, but you are not real enough power
Despite all the dirt that you're doing
You do all in hiding, but I am no better
I can see all of your terrors
Still remain in quiet and wonder in private and silence
Like if I just speak on it, would the people go buy it?
Fuck it just do it for self, I am demand and supplier
I trial by fire, I am the man

But I'm too high to riot, I'm too high to riot
I'm just too high to riot
Bas you in the city?
Baby nah I'm on the road, Fiends
Pockets full of money left them all on the floor

Probably should have claimed all the hoes that I fucked on my customs declarations
Check the faces all through my crew, it's like every race
So to call me racist, is so fucking baseless
But until your nation apologize
I fuck a European bitch for every African nation they colonize
And Add us some commas there to follow my dollars sign
And boost up my bottom line
And you don't want to hear it fine, they used to make it a crime to fuck white women
But damn, better give me a lot of time
Free love, whole world mixed up fuck boy you out of time
So what could brown do for you? UPS nigga
I done flew up out the nest nigga
The world bigger than the block man thats why they killed Pac
Couldn't stop us, we still looking for the rest nigga
Fiends

But I'm too high to riot, I'm too high to riot
I'm just too high to riot
Bas you in the city?
Baby nah I'm on the road, Fiends
Pockets full of money left them all on the floor
Pockets full of money left them all on the floor
But I'm too high to riot, I'm too high to riot

Why you so dramatic?

That's enough
You think I give a fuck or you talk static
I'm holdin' heaven it's automatic
You think I give a fuck or you talk static
I'm holdin' heaven it's automatic

Cause I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Yeah I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Ho I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron

Cause each day we wake up
We smoke L's we make love
We bump Soul in your basement
Bump Cole in my truck
Cause we ride, we ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride, we ride

It's just me, you, Jack and Ginger
Mary's here my dear
No need to ask I'll bring her pour me a glass
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone
And if it's mine that's you honey
Stick together like new money
Hit Dubai on that dune buggy
Catch some rays like it's Tampa Bay
And I know what drives you crazy
On how I switch daily
From love is so amazing
To love is so enslaving
Yet all you have is patience
Fight for us as if life is love
If love is gone it's dead life in us
I repent all my sins
Always trynna put knife in us
I hear my devil's enticing but
They run amok every night
They love to fuck WOOP
They ain't nothin' but some pressure cause
Pressure bust
Promise for the two of us, I never rush
It's just me, you, Jack, and Ginger
Mary's here my dear
No need to ask I'll bring her, pour me a glass
I'm in my zone

Cause I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Yeah I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Ho I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron

Fiji water in my iron
Cause each day we wake up
We smoke L's we make love
We bump Soul in your basement
Bump Cole in my truck
Cause we ride, we ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride, we ride

And she was like Lauryn Hill tell him
I was trynna be a player still on my Bill Bellamy
But she couldn't understand
Cause everytime we go out we go out with a bang
She just want a taste
Fill up with regrets now you get em by the text
Bitch you never wear the smiley face OK
You can tell me bout it or you can tell it to the ace
Cause we never let it go to waste
Don't you ever let me go to waste
Black star so we couldn't burn out
Like black cards we ain't gettin' turned down
My God gon' get the word out
That's laughter my bitch got ass like NASA
That line prolly only makes sense to me
That's fine I'm the shit to me
That's fine I'm the shit to me

Why you so dramatic?
Why you so dramatic?
​​​​​​
Mama told me you were getting sicker
Daily she'd call me say it's my name
You were calling, I mean, I was your favorite
I was named after your father, you were the sweetest aunt
Never had kids of your own but you made me your own
Busy on the road, I couldn't make it back home
You couldn't make it that long, I'll never forgive my self
I think I love just the hurting fact
I think I love when you hurt me back
Til we under the dirt, I keep you close
Yeah, under my shirt
I keep you tucked to the side
I'm Mr. Jekyl, I got something to hide
I fancy love, but I get stuck off of pride
I hope you understand
I got a list of daily lovers
Succumb to the beast or become it, live from the belly of it
Just trying to survive, I'm searching for any others
Lets get together make the whole world believe us
New world allegiance, fiends living our dreams out
Nigga believe it
Seen the world three times, nigga believe it
They out here selling peace signs, you niggas believed it
I don't
My behaviors unbecoming
My neighbors look at me funny like I should move out
Nigga you get a new house
This shit ain't easy
Multiple choices I had, turned into voices I have
No where to run, I'm moving forward and forging the path filling the loneliness path
Nigga, this shit ain't easy
So spare me the front and the fake
You ain't put shit in the pot, fuck is you touching the plate?
General guidelines to ride by
Can't kill my vibe, you couldn't find mine
Come to New York City, I'm in the skyline with a fine dime
And nigga we ain't fine dining
Hit the Halal stand for cheap plates
Hit the high line, that's a cheap date
I ain't worthy, fuck it who is?
Do what you do girl, fuck it you lit
Hundred niggas yelling "New York back"
I hear em rapping they only set, "New York back"
I'm in Queens to Harlem, the Garden I rap
And I'm only hearing New York clap
Bout to move out to Cali, got a little thing out the valley
And this one girl at hollywood hookah
I wish I knew to show her how to maneuver
Truth, through the city like a presidential motorcade
On my way so the motherfuckers don't shake
Never mind I'm just smoking that grade A
Running with the same niggas since grade eight
You ain't never seen no strange ones appear
My niggas been the same ones for years
I don't do it for the peers, I do it for the fam
Man, all of my angles are clear
Other day yo, I was shopping on Rodeo
Got a call from my nigga Cheyo
Said the hood hot bro
Gotta get away yo
Losing niggas like every day
Told 'em 18 months I'ma get a tour bus
Coming up and we never looking back
Need a rut to the cuts that bleeds deep
Three ducks in the truck like beep beep

Life is what you make of it, it's play-doh
This year, this year man goes back to the moon

If you coming to my city wanna know the deets?
I'm the embassy, I'm the one to see
Yeah baby, yeah baby
From over here but I took it over there baby
Riding in the drop, let your hair crazy
Climbing to the top going stair crazy
Crazy how the game opened up
A nigga ain't been home for some months
But when I get home I be posted up
Do it for the city til the coast is us
From a city where a nigga turn a penny to a twenty
But when the penny turns friends turn to enemies
As semis turn urns into memories
Make shots nigga burn like the Hennessy
The city got problems, the city's so godless
I watch it all burn like it's heresy
Witchcraft for your bitchass, which craft is you gift at?
I live in the moment, the moment is timeless
I hear all your talk but you're so unaccomplished
Opinions are nonsense
And I ain't got time for opinions to process
These days I'm inspired by me and nothing else
Bottles of tequila and some weed and nothing else
You know my niggas with me and no one else
I ain't pressing you can hold them hoes, sudden death
Got golden goals
Fuck a penny for your thoughts, nigga, anyhow
I just called my nigga Ron, he brought the Henny out
Got them things in the Kool-Aid in this motherfucker
Like a gang of Gorillas in this motherfucker

That's a closed book, when she with me got your bitch open
And she don't get mook, when she with me got your bitch smokin'
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
That's a closed book, when she with me got your bitch open
And she don't get mook, when she with me got your bitch smokin'
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert

No tats but my passport got plenty
I board flights and I ask, "Do you got Henny?"
And she say, "Courvoisier"
I say, "Fuck it, I would like plenty"
How many these nights do I got in me
Couldn't really tell, blind every day, the same time
Picture every face drawn on got on a for sale sign
Me? I gotta stay sharp, can't afford a stale mind
See? I'm 'bout my bread, motherfucker
And I can't afford a stale mind
My city grimy, that Rollie shiny, well, you can't afford to tell time
And they gotta take squats on the jail time
Cause nobody got guap for the bail bonds
And they had to get street cause college ain't cheap and
Mama gon' eat, if we gotta pop heat so be it
Puttin' in work, Soviet, and that shit work, you see it
Put your latest work in a hearse and I send it to the dirt
Lil nigga, that's where your CD is, CC 'em
Ah, put 'em on alert, me? I make art cause it's from the heart
Love me 'til I'm gone, when I die you gon' have to hit a fuckin' museum to see it, Bas

That's a closed book, when she with me got your bitch open
And she don't get mook, when she with me got your bitch smokin'
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert

Yeah, you know the models on the coupe
But you don't even know what's in your food
Nigga, Google it, be alert, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Put your young ass in debt
Now they got hands on your handsome check
You in check, nigga, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
She catchin' VD's and passin' 'em off like TD's and you knee deep
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Yeah, whole country at war
And you don't even know what for cause we only want more
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
You never thought I'd make it this far, did you
You always had to make it hard for me
But I'm a motherfuckin' star, bitch didn't you know?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
My brother Ib told me some niggas just wanna be safe
And some niggas just wanna be great
Which one are you? Let's go make history today
Let's go make history today
Boy use your brain, only your heart can lead
You'll figure your way man, this shit ain't for me to say
I come, I love until my heart can't bleed
I'm on the road, I guess it ain't meant for me to stay
But I'm here with you

I'm here with you
I'm here with you
I'm here with you

Hey world, your favorite movie is on, it's called "Attack On Niggas"
The fathers that didn't pass, they all stacked in prisons
But that shit don't get a pass, no that shit don't get a grant
Might as well go fill a bag
Ridin' around, no tinted glass
Why I can't have tinted glass? Cause that cause suspicion
Cops flash like cinemax, don't lack ammunition
Might as well go get a gap, might as well go give it back
Don't know if they'll get it right, but I know that we'll get it last
Might as well go spend a rack at a black owned business
Had my mind on hoes, now I'm back on business, that's real
Back to what's important, I'mma build with you
Cause you're here for me and I'm here with you

I'm here with you
I'm here with you
I'm here with you

You never thought I'd make it this far, did you
You always had to make it hard for me
But I'm a motherfuckin' star, bitch didn't you know?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
Ceelo with the G's
Put the paper down, rake the leaves
Piece of little weed
Nigga break it down, pick the seeds
Fiend, roll a swisher please
No promethazine, got amphetamines
Got me on a devil lean
Sahara to the Gobi niggas know me to be hot as water
Say, "Trust me, he flows"
Not livin' for tomorrow, got no time to borrow
Bitch, I rep my borough
Yeah, trust me Queens know
Fuck a knight in shining armor, play for team No Daughters
What this game has done taught us is "Trust me, she blows"
Stop makin' demands, bitch stay in your pocket
She eyein' my grands, bitch stay out my pocket
She eyein' my man, go ahead bitch rock it
We get it and split it, I never could knock it
I look at the bar and I bet I could top it

Hundred racks just to drive off a lot, though
Scenic route just to dodge all the potholes
20 racks at retail, isn't it?
Cause the devil's in the details, isn't it?

Ceelo with the G's
Put the paper down, rake the leaves
Here's a lil' weed
Nigga break it down, pick the seeds
Fiend, roll a swisher please
Cause the mook it give me epiphany
When hoes try to play me like tympani
Like Mighty Kong, show me finer homes
And designer stones, I want Tiffany's
Told her find a clone, I know I'm kind of stoned
No trick bitch, you can't get wit' me
Cause I found my zone
Had to put on a form, a good fit for me
I seldom see myself in dreams
I live this shit, no issues wit' my self-esteem
Tunnel vision, hear every station
Yo television, I failed to mention
Frail attention in school, dog
Failed attention, that rude boy
Fire lit by my crew boy
To acquire shit that I'm due boy


Fall back or pass through
Matter fact, that nigga that gassed you was ass too
Son, we gon' last like tattoos
Ho nigga get a glass shoe, why?
You can try it, but you can't high tie it
That shit weak and you can't fight fire
I've been wired for days, out in London town
I just lock shit down but I ain't got priors
Feelin' like the best, nigga ain't that biased?
Fuck, try it straight to the head but I ain't Lem Bias
From the ground up, to them telephone wires
I hold down my city since Boys on Da Block
They gave me the key, I done blown all the locks
Called a committee, Queens in this bitch
I hit all the spots, I brought all them with me
Never been petty, don't got the time to be harboring envy
I'm Fendi with mine
Gucci, bitch I got the plug, I got whatever you need, but I ain't got no love
Got something to say? I don't hear it, I can't understand
Your chatter don't make it across the Atlantic and I'm out in Europe
I'm wit' all my niggas, I never take this shit for granted
The cards have been handed, deuces is wild
Deuces is power, deuces like two hundred twenty two thou
Deuces for love, Cut it though deuces I'm out
I'm out
I'm out
I hope you figure it out

Shine black man melanin gold
I hope you never get old
Keep your youthful spirit
I know the world do fear it
You're the tip of the spear
And with our dyin' breaths, I bet the world gon' hear it, look
I been saving money for my taxes
Bassy keep on jumpin' through these brackets
I got 20 bitches coming back to the crib
I make sure my niggas got some racks, what you need?
They gon' shoot through niggas like it's practice
I just make the money run some laps
Every time I pass go see the cash grow
We don't even act cordial, we assholes
Bitches in my lasso, is that so?
That's word to my last hoe, I'm that cold
Runnin' through the town a black soul
My past froze twenty-nine times over
Look I have seen more than my time
Lived 9 lives for about twenty cats over, I told ya
Everything you've done I done overdid, I'm over it
Nigga, Dreamville the whole coast how we shouldered it?
Them boys stale like toast when it's overdid
I hope they quit for real
But if they don't I got a million joints
I got the flow in pocket, the emoji rocket how I'm outta here
A lot of em' sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Keeping both eyes open wide rain man
Crew high on that fuck your life drank man
We slide in the bucket like paint
Never gave a fuck, fuck what you might think
Ran up in the club 'till they sent the lights in
Had to tell the owner please let the lights dim
Five more minutes see me a nice slim
Thick bitch with the you, me and my grin
Tell her bring the crew you me and my friends
See where the night end with the right guy
Trust me and my kin, speak with the right pen
Creep like the lightning in the night sky
Go deep Janet Jackson, we back to back in
Black SUV's, black tints would you look at that?
I'm booby-trapped in your fluid black skin
No groupie action, your bougie accent
You're truly classic, girl we outta here

Bas, it's Bassy
Queens nigga with the Fiends nigga
Got the bean waitin' in the pocket ooh

I asked P, what's poppin'?
He said we are nigga, trips to DR nigga
Got the borough jumpin' like it's J.R. Smith
Know a couple niggas' let the A-R spit
Got no interest what you say y'all did
Only where y'all live
Smokin' blunts 'cause that's the way I live
And where I live?
Niggas dyin' front of their shorty, wives
And their brother's ride on the other side
Every death is like a 100 lives
Flatlined from the black nine
I could feel the pressure multiplying
Make you feel like ain't no hope in trying
But we always trying
All this blood I bet it float to sea and wash out
'Cause they don't want you to see but watch out
Nigga watch out

See I want you to see
I've been through so many things
Things ain't always what they seem
Hope you get the message
I hope you figure it out
Now I'm right where I belong
Had to let it go
All the pain I was holding on
Now I get the message
I had to figure it out
You got to feel the music, do you understand?
It takes you higher and higher
Every day, everyday, everyday, everyday
I been chasing the truth
But oooh I've been waiting for you
Ooooh I've been waiting for you

And I was like Looord
And she was like "boooy you better be smart with your ways"
I turn to Mike Shaw
And he was like dawg  "I think she got the Donk Of The Day"
Cause girl you got the Donk Of The Day
That gotta be the donk of the day
You know you got the donk of the  day
That gotta be it

Never had a day worth planning
Cause every damn day is outlandish
I holla'd at Wave Bandana
My nigga is so high outlandish
I said we can hit the hood spot
My niggas do spray they canvas
Or we can hit the good spot
But Imma have to change appearance
I went to buy a cardigan
I seen you at the mall and then
I could re-call again, I was on youuu and
My nigga was on your friend
They been steady two years now
But I never called again
And you ain't never fall off
So can I get on again
Breeze through the city baby
You would think I'm on to win
I think I was born to spend
I heard you was dancing girl
I think you were born to bend
I think I was born, born again when I found that pen mothafuckin' right

Every day, everyday, everyday, everyday
I been chasing the truth
But oooh I've been waiting for you
Ooooh I've been waiting for you

And I was like Looord
And she was like "boooy you better be smart with your ways"
I turn to Mike Shaw
And he was like dawg  "I think she got the Donk Of The Day"
Cause girl you got the Donk Of The Day
That gotta be the donk of the day
You know you got the donk of the  day
That gotta be it

Never had a day worth planning
Cause every damn day is outlandish
I'm going over sees outlandish
A nigga so high outlandish
Man I'm like a fly on the wall
And these four walls heard it all
I could hit a feline in your voice
But them words won't hurt at all
Cause these broads gone leave til the morning
Champagne form bubbles in my bong
All I need is the love of my crew
Fuck you, my borough know I'm on
Never been to work with a briefcase
But I'm still in each state
So my Momma text, and said, "be safe"
Saw one from my ex it said "be great"
First thought like she fake
Text back like "preciate"
Girl be brave
What you want hundred replays
This shit is dead like Enyce
Dear Nefertiti
I'm sure your'e a Goddess or
My shades are 3D
Cause damn they look large, them titties

She always on them up is when they go down
All she know is turn up girl slow down
Slow down, girl slow down
Body type Mya, face more Aaliyah
Stacked, used to run track
Til she tore her knee up
Me I'm from Queens
And we up, my last shit crack
Bitch I'm back with the re-up
Already caught the vibes
But I don't got the time
Girl I'm saying you should know
She said, "bottom line I be lying if I said I was surprised when you said you had to go
Met her out in France and her ass meaner
In them Euro hotels with the Ass Cleaners
Long ways from them days when we had peanuts
Looked back we just laugh like damn we up
She said let's go
Back to the bathroom to do some blow, Woah
Said you was sprinting, you really shouldn't do that blow no more
Said I do what I do, it ain't enough for a vote
What's it to you, you don't know how I cope
Shit I done seen it's like ether to me
You don't know how I roll so you speechless to me
You niggas, Niggas don't get it you got it so good
I'm developing penis envy, Pause
No Venus in me, give a fuck if you niggas from Mars
You need to chill
I see the Coke in your jaw
You getting  too aggy
You still got about half a gram in that baggy
I'm gone take care of this tab
And I'll probably just hail you a cabby

Every day, everyday, everyday, everyday
I been chasing the truth
But oooh I've been waiting for you
Ooooh I've been waiting for you
I swear it feel like, I swear it feel like
I swear it feel like a quarter to midnight
Riding in Dis 5
Bumping my own shit, bumping my own shit
Pedal to the floor, I ain't braking no more

And we get paid, that's off words
And I been made, ho, that's my word
Ho, that's my word
This shit is for life, N-W-O
I ain't hitting you back, i'm done with you hoes
N-W-O

Money growing farms, gotta get your figures up
Gotta grow an arm 'fore you pull your niggas up
Spend it on a bond money, you was savin' up
And all they could respond is you never gave enough
Everything gratuitous
You don't want a pot to piss, you want a pool to piss
Never taking it for granted like i'm new to this
Keep my waitress heavy handed, fuck my stewardess
Who is this sick nigga? Jealousy a trait saved for you bitch niggas
So wait bitch, hold up, get a hold of this nigga
Just got out the meeting and they talking big figures
But i'ma need more money than these drop a brick niggas
Convos and commas, convos and K's
If that's what you talking, ho, convos for days
Sky so big, got condos in space
Let's save the world, all in good taste

And we get paid, that's off words
And I been made, ho, that's my word
Ho, that's my word
This shit is for life, N-W-O
I ain't hitting you back, i'm done with you hoes
N-W-O

I got us, a worth, that's the truest of it
A bird lose itself worth, that's the Louie of it
Why so materialistic, life will pass you, egotistic
It's how the universe work, that's the beauty of it
Seen you from the first twerk, that's the booty of it
Lately been so hedonistic, give me ass, don't need no friendship
Living life, all my tickets copped one way
And these bitches all in my runway
As of late, I drink and smoke everyday
Hesitate, just another shot you never take
Riding down the block in the Rari
Tryna' squeeze two hoes besides me
Six at the club, turned twelve at the hotel
You would think these hoes Saimese
And they got hommies, bodies
And they roll l's if I let them ride shotty
Cause that's all it would take
Let's save the world, all in good taste

And we get paid, that's off words
And I been made, ho, that's my word
Ho, that's my word
This shit is for life, N-W-O
I ain't hitting you back, i'm done with you hoes
N-W-O

Me? I'm too fly, y'all sweet, y'all niggas fruit flies
Y'all speak, y'all niggas hoopla, y'all weak, y'all hoop ride
I must be the coldest, walk up in the room (vroom)
And ya bitch old, i'm looking for some new's
I must be the coldest, walk up in the room (vroom)
And ya bitch old, i'm looking for some new's
I got it
I got it, it's lit, it's lit
Yeah

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives
Pockets is full of the hope from the quotes I never wrote
Tell em' me and my bro Doe Burger came for the dope only
Benjamin Franklin them folks owe me
Bassy told you my nigga, I got the loud and it's lit
Went to college a bit, but ain't pay off all my tuition
Now I'm back in the town from rapping for crowds
A nigga been searching for purpose
And guess what I found?

Pastor Black Lip join my diocese
Warn the people sleeping on the legion
I'm a Dreamvillain talking major keys
Think DJ Khaled playing Mavis Beacon
Soulo found the loud and lit it back woods
Back to back, it's like I'm mad at Meek
Burning brain cells with my nigga that just made bail like last week
Still ducking strays in the plies like submissive bitches
With my dogs at the top and we in heat, fuck all ya'll 'til I'm in the box
Six feet underneath the gravel, casket made of 47 karat gold
Hear the trumpets blow, Jesus banging the gavel
Soul

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives

Soulo hold up let me get it back
Had to run the borough, bring the city back
Got the power in my head, yeah, yeah
Been a year since I fit in fitted caps
Go and tell them niggas that Bas brought the East back, eat that
Niggas play my album and repeat that
Niggas play your album, hear them weak raps
And delete that, that's soft shit
Need some wheatgrass
Better boss up, awh fuck
Got your bitch starstruck, all fuss
Got five figures in my offers
My how the times have changed
I might leave tour and go buy the Range
I see the snakes, I see the fakes
I see 'em straight through designer frames
I just got crib out in L.A
I get my pick at the thots, but she can not stay
If she had her way she'd be picking the locks
Got a shower big enough to dance in
With your favorite singer and the dancers
In the party, in the back booming
Rep the city like I'm Pat Ewing
Fiends high as bald eagles
And my product all legal
Word to Soulo my nigga
I got the loud and it's lit

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off

Like I do my Saint Laurents
She can't wait to take 'em off
Complimenting my expensive jeans
Turn your housewife to a thot-ty
Thought a bitch cadance made a thizz face
All these niggas do is copy, wait what?
We ain't buying none of that shit, that shit
For the birds and the fact is, you just a gnat to a pterodactyl
However unbalanced that is, this ain't about status
We cease and desisting y'all, the teachers dismissing ya'll
Insisting you give it up
Cole World, codeine in my cup
Fiends

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives
Pockets is full of the hope homie
Tell 'em we came for the dope only
For the dope only
Benjamin Franklins them folks owe me
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
(You niggas just talking the most like
Housewives)

Word to Soulo my nigga

We be smoking, we be drinkin'
We be fuckin', tell her quick
“Would you please stop saying we
‘Cause we mean nothing, celibate"
Sure I’m bout it, adamant
I’m straight up nigga, don’t you be fronting, let’s do it

Let’s do it there
Or we could do it here
But when we done it’s a love souvenir

You say you want me to have the world (You sure?)
You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?)

If Ogee got them bangers than I go forever with flows
On a blank canvas Bas so incredibly dope
Giving light to my dreams, I couldn't measure the scope
Turn that white into green, that's Incredible Hulk
Man I'm so fly I see the heavens approaching
The Pearl in them Gates, I'm burning a stogie, than pearling a jay
My memory fades, that's cool cause every day is a memory made
The Judge a crook he throw the book at every case
So we celebrate life, that's for every occasion
I ran out of patience, I can't be complacent
When niggas a take a limb and leave you with casings
My car, it barely start it need a new AC
My star ripped out my heart and told me replace it
My job it never call, I need me some wages
And you, well you, you just need me to make it
(Ohhhh) You just need me to make it
I get it I get it I get it, you just need me to make it

You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?)
You say you want me to have the world
I get it I get it I get  it

Hit it in the mornin' or the evenin' if that pussy good
I'm probably never leaving love, do you still believe in love?
No it ain't real, Damn not even us
She been down so long she gotta even up
Nevermind my intentions, of Rari's and mentions
You see them hoes like it, and now you get defensive
You prying in my mentions, and I can feel the tension
You'd rather me a real job, suit ay'?, a pension
You feel I be a new guy as soon as it sets in
I feel I'm losing you bout' every second
Don't you get apprehensive, we served a sentence together, I know you down forever
Aware of what I got, I couldn't replace it
You want me for me, see the glory and base it
I love you for it, cause you can't even fake it
A heart on the fringe, you don't want me to make it
You don't want me to make it

You say you want me to have the world (You sure?)
You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?)
No she frontin'
You say you want me to have the world
Nah she frontin', Ohh your frontin'
You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?)

It's you world (x20)
I'm out in Boca Raton
I'm sipping Roca Patron

Talking 'bout life and how I just ain't for her, I been inclined to agree
'Cause all I been doin' is me
Now I can't be your one baby girl, nah
But I play the two or the three now

Give her the dick and I'm gone
I'm like a ticking time bomb
I'm on the road, grind time for the dough it's my time
She cheer me on pom poms
She good for the soul, she good for the mind
She help me get found, TomTom
She help me eat clean, balsamic
She might end up meeting my mama
Let's take it back like western time zones
Used to call you up to share my milestones

Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga

This a true flame, this ain't butane
Who changed when you called? Who came?
Still do, never falter
You know I rock with you like Gibraltar
Ain't no pressure, how 'bout me and you make a movie in memories
Remember, now that's forever
Gotta love the way we put it all together
Lord knows I love the way He put you all together
You are stellar, and I'm a champion
Clique full of real niggas, living way up in the hills, nigga
My next door neighbor's a Hilfiger
Big gate cops can't come thru
Got chicks down for the one-two
Got one thing, she the one to
Lord, how many of my dreams gon' come true?

With you I could be patient
Limousine, that's a little tad much for you
Ain't no need, put some weed in that blunt for you
We go deep girl, we go deeper

Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for a nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for a nigga, don't

Don't front, when you see me in the city and your friends, they  talk about me
Talking down about me, how they say I ain't committed
What the fuck they know about me?
Told you everything there is to know about me, still you doubt me
I got niggas in the state and the county and the city
All my niggas that escaped, 100k to Sallie May, let me get the record straight
We gon' see some better days, facts
Bassy Bas the Basquiat of rap then basket my pain and left on my needs
Peel on these scars, appealing to bars
It's something I need to function, not me
It's nothing I need, nothing like you, so that's what I need
Looking for you, and you and I need it, got justice side
You to my dreams, you were my angel, viewing my demons
You are now in all of my sins, I pray you're undo
All that I been, I pray it come through, I pray it come too
I pray it come true

Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for your nigga, don't

With you I could be patient
Limousine, that's a little tad much for you
Ain't no need, put some weed in that blunt for you
We go deep girl, we go deeper

Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
She fuck 'wit the team cause she love her some ballers
Opportunity rings and I'm finna call her
Got a backpack cause I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
I'm blowin' up spots bitch I got heat, I used to have quaps
That's a quarter on the block, fuck the cops
That's the order from a boss, march on the court
House donors on the lawn, tell 'em that we miss Trayvon
Mean it sincerely, vision not 20/20 but I see through ya shit clearly
TV couldn't really impair me, fear tactics don't scare me
Don't need no designer clothes but I'll take them designer drugs
Need a different kind of love, Aladdin love Jasmine
Me I'd rather fly the rug

I just wanna smoke in peace, ride through the open streets
I love my city and will do court but beefs claim lives like the open sea, I still love my city, if I die, I couldn't find a better location
I don't go on vacation, I don't go on vacation

Unofficial, off the record, it's impressive, what you done to me
Mr. Hilton, Mr. Westend, but I fuck her like the DoubleTree
Lord, I am just a 2 legged dog, everything I do for my dawgs
Take another step and we will teach a lesson
Paramedics do get involved
Everybody in ya crew is a fraud, everybody in my crew is a boss
Cause everyone agree you ain't gettin' shit for free
Boy you gotta pay ya dues to the cause
All them hoes choosin' and hawkin'
It's my house take ya shoes when you walk in
And these hoes make appointments now
Me and my city like Christopher Walken


Vacation, my vision is so clear, my vision is so clear

Nigga so off couldn't hit a tee-ball
And you a grown nigga like 6 feet tall
Walked the line and he got chalked, ball so hard that he got lost
Look at that lead on the wall, all of my team gonna ball
We gon' leave 3hun of y'all, lookin' Neanderthals
That look like y'all 'fore a nigga evolved
Hope not, hit her with the dope dick and my crib's the dope spot
I ain't got time for appointments that don't flock
And bitches that come back to my crib and don't pop
And niggas that smoke all my shit and don't cop
I see you muthafuckas

My vision is so clear, I see you motherfuckers
My vision is so clear
My vision is so clear
My vision is so clear
My vision is so clear
Smokin that good
No Reggie, No Theus
My niggas the G'est
Don't shit come between us
No money, No hoes
Don't shit come between us
How we play dirty but step out the cleanest?
G shit bitch learn the meaning
From here to Medina, I bag all the model chics
Call em Athena, cause they are some Godesses
My politics don't got no policies just livin life everyday no apologies
Apologies for the delay I was up in the stars rollin up on astrology
Economies in disarray but a couple mixtapes gon put me in ecology
Ecology?
Ecology, that's green nigga
Global Warming, that's me nigga
Heatin up, They ain't keepin up
Had a taste, I ain't eat enough
Hoes fast like they let a whole day pass without eatin none
If the 44's rung, Hemdi's the one
If them hoes open, I'll leave with them
One

You in a hot air balloon
You could be around the moon
You eat a pound of the shrooms
You'll never be higher than I am
You could mook all of the keef
You could blow all of the schneef
You go as high as you reach
You'll never be higher than I am
You'll never be higher than I am ( so high)
You'll never be higher than I am (so blown)
You'll never be higher than I am (I'm Mooked)
You'll never be higher than I am ( I'm Mooked)
I'm Super Mooked

Should I tell my story?
Or should I show my scars?
This is Hemdi and Bas, this is avant garde
Niggas swear they smart, till they ass get snatched thru the fog
I got a couple bitches think they slick, but far from espionage
Me and 3 bitches, that's just a collage
I'm an artist of a rare kind, you just a facade
The quiet sun, metamorphosis, I have just evolved
My horizon bright and I box thru life like Cus was involved
Muhammad Ali, the Iron Mike-ness
If I lay somethin' down and it's war time nigga no women no kids that kill is righteous
Got blood on my glasses, give me a second to wipe it
Lets proceed when it touch white folks I guess that's when it becomes a crisis
But we still in the ghetto, where we chase money and hoes
The OG's said "Thank you, young fella
I guess nobody had the courage to write this"
And we drive foreign cars, But the evil drives us
And we ride on each other so easy
Cause the demons ride us

You in a hot air balloon
You could be around the moon
You eat a pound of the shrooms
You'll never be higher than I am
You could mook all of the keef
You could blow all of the schneef
You go as high as you reach
You'll never be higher than I am
You'll never be higher than I am ( so high)
You'll never be higher than I am (so blown)
You'll never be higher than I am (I'm Mooked)
You'll never be higher than I am ( I'm Mooked)
How did you know
This is what I always wanted
Could never have done many thing
Where you quick taking me? I might tumble
I’m trying, will somebody make you just shut up about it?
Can we settle down, baby?
No, let’s ride

I’m wired nigga on molly and Red Bull
Party with the fiends you know ain’t no party in civil
2 devils on my shoulders and I’m just caught in the middle
Got decisions to make, the decision’s been made
I swear these bitches screaming YOLO fore they sniff the yola
Feeling like a Porsche 4 door, used to feel like Corollas
My niggas still moving the yola, till they fill the quota
Popo on em like they just paroled
And fuck the help, they never showed em
So we outchea, get it by any means
I’m on fire; no lying, them boys remind me of anti-freeze
And my engine keep running, I’m supplying the energy
Ain’t a thing, you great a sin, I’m high on the canope
Looking out for my niggas, keep an eye on my enemies
Bitch, I’m just where I plan to be
So fuck what you say
This a new CBA, your favorite rapper’s been amnestied
Don’t pretend to be classy, ho
‘Cause I prefer nasty hoes
Test driving broads, ho I’m a car show
Pockets all stinch if I see them narcos
Prolly gonna pinch, nerf a nigga in the stick
The prison’s like the man, it shoulda gave us bar codes
Heart cold like it’s waiting to be transplanted
Band wagon feeling, guess I’m grant standing
Got them hoes on all 4’s, guess they can’t stand it
Shouts to oak shades, shouts to bandanna

And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
I spend a condo in the club, one bottle won’t do, no
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
I spend a condo in the club, two bottles won’t do, no

I check the homies and I breeze
And chickens hit my phone up, say they only wanna please
Some niggas actin phony ‘cause they only want a piece
I’ll be it, I see through, I never deceive you
Fiend

And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
Keep you close to my heart
Save up the moment,  a moment

Since my niggas facin probation we gon smoke they faces off
Wish that we can smoke and smoke until we burn them cases off
I’m not too proud about, not much to smile about
It’s like they never took them fuckin braces off
Gunshots… but ain’t no fuckin races start
Either play your part and play it apart or play it raw, hole in 1
Few hunned yards, you a superstar groupies heart
But yo lady got the truest heart
I’m on the verge of greatness, patience is the only virtue
But for the moment I’ll be… overindulging, I see
Gracious faces, greener passes, gold chains, purple fumes
Couple niggas still breathing but to me R.I.P
I give niggas a shovel, tell em “get to digging, you ain’t finished?
Til that hole is big enough for you to fit in”
I don’t need credit, I don’t need a fuckin credit limit
Me and my team travel like we never learn to pivot
And spend it in cities where bitches numbers be like 21 digits
How I’m supposed to dial that when I’m high as that, hah?
How was such a chilly breeze flowin from yo eye and flash
I thought fire breed new life but niggas is dying… fast

I’m on a pill, think I love this bitch – that’s how real it feel
Sniffin out a Benjamin, that’s the cleanest bill
Poisons infiltrate my regiment and even still
I ain’t numb and under this I could feel it still


I’m on a pill, think I love this bitch – that’s how real it feel
Sniffin out a Benjamin, that’s the cleanest bill
Poisons infiltrate my regiment and even still
I ain’t numb and under this I could feel it still
I'm just trynna get ahead like the Grand Central ramp to the L.I.E, When a nigga headed west and the traffic is a mess
Why the police pull me over? wanna see ID & registration
Them papers don't show you my dedication
I done came up like David Blaine
Y'all niggas don't know bout levitation
It's for the takin' shots up no hesitation
No head fakes, I ain't never waitin'
Me and mines these are bonds that ain't never breakin'
Building blocks 'til the ceiling pops
Y'all killin' time that's record pacing
Dreamville shit record breakin'
Been cookin' up since my parent's basement I'm still cookin', these records blazin', you hear this shit?
I don't see you niggas I just see myself on some mirror shit
Re-decide 'fore I pull your blinds
Ain't no seeing eyes on my pyramid
Joke nigga you serious? startin' shit but I finish it like a period
And you still a bitch like a period and that's real
I’m looking at my receipt like goddamn it, that’s my receipt
She do it with no hands but damn it she wide receive
Super Mookin fiends, bitch, we the new elite
Locally, overseas, been so well received
This is life like, 3 strikes of felonies
3 times ahead of niggas, don’t know a better nigga
I need a sweater with some SMF lettering
A tour with 30 busses that my niggas go hammer in
And we could through all the litigation, we ain't settling
Callin' all the pots black, but we ain't kettling
Standing at the door, won’t you let us in?
Kick it down, going places we ain't never been
You tryna find a torch and we just laugh at your misfortune
Staring out the window ‘cause this life is in full motion
Make a movie out the B roll, the action keep you focused
Fuck your token of appreciate, I need payment
Nothing say thanks like a whole bunch of O’s
And some pretty little hoes when anything goes and
I’mma shoot my shot if she open
I said I’mma shoot my shot if she open

Uh, I’ve been lookin' at you all damn night
You the cookie I’ve been lookin' for my whole damn life
Bitches early, this a long ass night
Shorty bust it and suck it and all that right, yeah
She was on that white all last night
Did it off me, man she skied my pipe
That pedico make her need that diaper
Shittin' on the game, bitch I need that diaper

I’m afflicted, sick like flu though
I’m the future like Pluto
All my niggas like kudos
All my bitches got culo
You can grab it and have it
Never thirsty, I’m cool ho, she let me thrash it like Pujols
Up at bat with a 2-0, elementary mathematics
I need at least 2 hoes and give me at least 2 O’s
That’s 56 or 57, pending on your connect and how much that nigga respect it
Cause check it, to a fiend
It’s more than a gram, you understand?
Ain't enough snow in the sand, you understand?
Bitch don’t jump in the lake, it’s all sharks
My nigga, it’s money to be made, I want parts

I’m hard on hoes, call me the critic
My nigga call me up like, "Bas they all could get it"
But them bitches is beat, them hoes was hit
Damn, the weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
Bitch
Part I: Highs

Strange highs, no day jobs, new address
Old vice, new temptress
Settle down one day this is practice
Where every coach is a model or an actress
Fiend
I just wanna meet some lawyer bitches
Fuck that, I just wanna meet some loyal bitches
So like Christmas Eve I just toy with bitches
Got hoes on beans like they Goya bitches

What you sayin ain't paid my due yet?
Well, fuck boi I be on the road still puttin work in the Duet
Fuck nigga, can you hear it? Me and your bitch gon sing a duet ( La- La- La- La)
No hero to them hoagies
Cause hoes get loose like bogies
If my nigga ask for it he could have her, I could only have two left
Broads all look from afar see the same view
Could accept who you are till they change you
Can't lose what you ain't choose
As far as I see it

Ironic, I was just lookin for a lighter but I found you now lets go
And fuck the night up ( the night up, the night up)
Lets go and fuck the night up ( the night up, the night up)
Lets go and fuck the night up
Ironic, I was just lookin for a lighter but I found you now lets go
And fuck the night up ( the night up, the night up)

And I came in mad early
Nigga we made it
Fuckin' kick ain't even drop
We made it
Alright man that was fun
We made it
Nigga I'm faded

I still remember the cold of last winter the struggle was heavy
Cole was like I was just playin' your shit, you know Salaam Remi?
He fucked with your tape he was impressed just as soon as I played it
I was so geeked I turned to the fiends like nigga we made it
He told me just got an offer for you it came through it was No ID
Then we pulled up to the club in a truck but a nigga had no ID
He went online on his phone just to Google and show em my faces
My nigga when they let us in that bitch I was like nigga we made it
Shout out to Dion he tried to put me on I mean it I'm gracious
But we had a dream build a home for the team so man we couldn't take it
But just see you later man Cole hit me up and say Interscope paid us
I asked how much and he was like nigga we made it
The very next day nigga I hit the bank and I emptied my savings
Oh what a feeling to put this shit simply its simply amazing
Spoke to my pops he said damn I miss Paris I need a vacation
I sent him two tickets for him and the misses like nigga we made it
Tell mom I love her
We gon make it baby, no discussions
Bas is nasty, spit disgusting
Gunna and 500 know a nigga hustling?
Got a 20? Fuck it, cop the buds and eat some Ruffles
Far as mook? We gon need a duffle
Do it by the book. Nigga we don't need a duffle
No police, no more trouble
But I'm troubled, got a homie who ain't heed the warning till they slugged em
Now we miss em and we love em
Yea we love em
Lord, I just wanna see his face!
I browse the profile page of my homie slain
I saw a post from a lady and this is what it say
"I cried when you passed away I still cry today
Although I loved you dearly, I couldn't make you the stay"
Live the Land of the Free, but we missin' the brave
They tell me " Remember me when you hittin' the stage"
In the darkness of night, I'm just missin' the days
That's why I spit on this mic, like I was kissin' the grave
Yea Boi I

Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a new car
And then I kick a few flows, so I could pimp a few hoes
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a new car
And then I kick a few flows, so I could pimp a few hoes

I used to know this girl she was the Devil in disguise
One look in her eyes
You would turn to gelatin
She only fuck with rappers if you ain't one you irrelevant
Only fucks with athletes if you ain't one then she take off like a track meet
Yea exactly
When I rap she know exactly what I'm saying ( I'm saying)
And when a nigga ball she know exactly what I'm playing now
If we go to eat, she look at me till I'm paying now ( I know )
Hold up now
You're a groupie. Say it loud, say it proud!
Bitch you lazy or you just a fool?
Shout out to Misha, had her baby and still finished school
I'ma believer
One day I'ma sit on a stool
On top the world and remember I used to sit on a stoop
Never swerve in the coupe
When it's work in the coupe
Now I pirate the game, tryin' to earn me some loot
I tell em " Stop being Nazi you better serve me my soup "
But this ain't Seinfeld
I flip that like some clientele
Yea motherfucka'

Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a new car
And then I kick a few flows, so I could pimp a few hoes
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a new car
And then I kick a few flows, so I could pimp a few hoes
Let the hecklers heckle
I am still puttin' up shots like the Heckle and Koch
I won't set foot in the box
I am the chef on the double shift
I just be cooking a lot
I got a zip and its rar
That should be cookin' the pot, cookin' the pot, cookin' it
 (x2)
Young nigga roll that joint
Young nigga roll that joint and roll that joint and roll that joint
Young nigga roll that joint

Praise God
He taught us his breathing
Don't fall off your high horse ain't Christopher Reevin'
Ain't nobody grieving, nobody missing
Married the game but she nobody misses
Can't blame the guns why don't nobody miss
Bring back my niggas now nobody missed
Back to the subject your body miss is like nobody maybe you Godbody
Tell me are you Artemis or you are remissed
Don't sell yourself short cause you are the shit a true art cause you are legit
Nonstop see me all seasons
Of that plane movie
I'm like Liam Neeson
Bitch I don't need no reason between me and you
It's all for the taking you workin'
Naw you just working on bitches that fake like they ain't
But they all for the taking too
My last shit's dope and my drop finna kill more niggas like Taken 2
I've been making moves what the fuck you doing
You line up for sneakers they line up for me
Get your head up straight boy your lineup funny
Bas
Just another story in the game
But every story ain't the same
But if you change can you change back
It's a shame that I came back

But my niggas wouldn't let me hold no weight
They said Bas you gonna make it get us out this fuckin' place
Anywhere we wanna take it Tokyo, Makow
Make hoes make french toast, and bow
Dinner at Del Frisco's
Houses in every zip code
I'm headin' out to Cali nigga you should see my rent though
I'm fuckin' with the vibes this shit a different tempo
I never need a mink coat we makin' strides
But I swear this shit is never simple
I'm trying to keep my lady
She never had a baby
I know she got the kid though
I sent more and pondered how to do that
Cause I ain't too good at love but I know how to do raps
Write it like MJ playing the 23
Wiser my age I've been graying since 23
Everyday it's like 20 beats I feast
Cause everything on my plate the fiends they just relate
We ain't even there but bitch look what we made
New York, New York, my city that is my state
My niggas going to court for ballin' love of the sport
Supply and demand, let's call it love of the snort
Let's call it love of the snort and all of the sort
It push me harder and farther
My father pushin' 70 don't want him dying a martyr for me
For his guidance I'll be grinding till he's off of his feet
I pray it all come from me
This shit is all for the fam the rest is all for the team, fiends
Never once slide type clique
Never untie hit the ground like a bus ride
Shake the town like a mudslide

City of the Empire
City of the Empire
City of the Empire

Queens shit, fiend shit
Queen bitch roll blunts seamstress
G shit, allegiance
To my real bitches and my real G's salute thee
It's Bas

Uh, I got green on my mind
A fiend, I need to get mine
She say your dough my glow a little greener than mine
But your soul ain't cleaner than mine
If you looking for a diamond, gotta find it
Go deep in the mines
And my game fucked with a bitch brain
I can go so deep in her mind
Couldn’t keep her, I’m fine, nothing lasts forever
My whole life patched together
And life ain’t a fucking joke
But we smoke, fuck and still laugh together
I said cool it girl, you know life is short
Uh, or whatever
You say you wrong boy, see mind in a long war, since forever

Ironic - I was just looking for a lighter but I found you
Now let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)

Yo, what exit is this?

Yeah?
I don't know, I just made that up. But I always figured, like, Amsterdam, last stop. Cause it says that on shit
That last train we were on was going straight to Belgium
I mean, look, ask somebody I guess
That waffle we had earlier was . Shit was good as hell
How far is Amsterdam, do you know?
It's about 55 minutes
55 minutes from here? Alright, thank you
Amazonian queen

Could you be what you seem, Amazonian queen
(Verse)
Vines in the ravine
Swing down from your throne and bow down to your king
What a life we chose, nothing but hoes
The good ones, few and far between – getting hard to see 'em
Come on Eileen, could you be my visine
I’m in need of your light, could you be my high beam?
Only for a few nights, I ain’t quite what I seem
In your city couple times a year, you know what I mean
Yea, you know what I mean
Bitch, you know what I mean
Girl, you know what I mean
I don’t move keys but I got room keys
All the salty women leaving on a sour note
All the sweet ones end up chiefing on my dab of smoke
Only evening that’s in question we was laid up at the Weston
Keep some candles that be scented, until it does
Fuck you think the towels for?
Fuck you think the towels for?
Fuck you think the towels for?
For the loud  gotta dampen the sound yea
Gotta dampen the sound yea...
Quarter water raised me
From a boy to a man
Like the shore to the sand, nigga I’m just tryna be free
I got a plan that you wouldn’t understand
Inmates to the man, now the BC’s
See this is Attica for the soul
Revolution, barricade all the doors
Let 'em know my soul ain’t for sale
And won’t be concealed in no type of cell
A cubical, the resistance different than a cuticle, shit is beautiful
When they try and break ya but they couldn’t graze ya
‘Cause you high up in the sky
Nigga, why you admiring the pie?
Come get you a slice 'fore these muhfuckas eat it all
But life ain’t cake, full of trials and tribulate
But we good ‘cause we beat 'em all
My maker hold my fate and I know we got a date
So I’m good if I don’t see tomorrow
I’m scrapin' up the plates, stuffin' life in my face
Just in case I never see tomorrow
Just in case I gotta see the morgue
Well in that case I hope I see Allah
And ask him why he had to take Amir
Man I really miss ya, it’s been too many years
I see you and your sisters, I see you and your kids
I see my aunt crying, man she spilled too many tears
But know this, fuck showbiz
If I make it anywhere, your kids already there
And boy you know we think about you every year
Every month, every week, every night in my sleep
I hope you come and visit like you do my pops
Man I just wanna kick it like we used to
Allah, please give a nigga blues clues
Why you take him? Why you spare me?
‘Cause I remember clearly
Sounds in my ears of them bullets flying near me

We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
Nigga, no time to waste
Don’t contemplate, just fly away
Yea fly, yea fly, yea fly
All my niggas just fly, yea fly, yea fly
Let’s go
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
Nigga, no time to waste
Don’t contemplate, just fly away
Yea fly, yea fly, yea fly
Boy fly, yea fly, yea fly

It'll be feelin' like a couple months, but it's only what?
10 minutes in this rented truck
Girl I only want 10 minutes in this rented truck
Got them windows foggin', hazy baby
Wildin' I'm an 80's baby
Super mookin' fiend we found nirvana like that naked baby

Don’t pace it, don’t chase it
That's straight lick – it burn slow
She role play my teacher and I can’t wait to learn nigga
I role play big turn up, Obey, that’s G shit
We smoking Js of that juicy fruit, that Juicy J, that 3-6
White T’s, first class flights and Nike kicks, believe this
Waves on, tsunami, she likely get seasick
I red tail that fly boy, Michael Phelp in the cloud, boy
In the sea of that loud boy, altitude is all altoids
Fresh bitch like breath mints
Whilin up in the section
The monkey’s roll and that kush to go
Bottles up in this section
(Hook)
Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down
Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down
(Verse)
She dolled up, I’m soda
Red cup that I hold up
Break the milk but wait, hold up
Fuck I do with my roll up
I want this shit and I want you too
I know this shit sound cynical
But can I skip the skit and get into you?
Baby can you strip and get in the pool?
Life is so yummy when your problems taste like honey
Every day so sunny when I’m pound cakin this money
2 hands on full grip, take this shit to the bank
She said boy you takin my breath away
Girl get a oxygen tank
Damn, caught you fallin but my feet were out of bounds
Sooner or later you gon reach some solid ground
Who the fuck said chilvery dead?
Girl, why you quit givin me head?
Makin me call Lewinski

(Hook)
Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down
Shorty baby, you the chosen one for now
Hold a nigga down, hold a nigga down
Hold a nigga down
Just hold a nigga down
Hold a nigga down
Just hold a nigga down
(Outro)
I know that I belongs to you
I wonder if I’ll ever be found
Caught between the life and the lights and uh
Oh maybe we can figure this out
I figure it’s ahead of where the crown I found
The hardest form of troublesome
‘Cause we always come undone, yea we always
Yea we always
I had a 5 year plan
But in 24 months, bitch I got it all done
24 blunts of the skunk, toast the glass to winners
Drinking 'til I vomit scallops, I guess that was dinner
I’m blown, got my shades on
But it’s funny right, ‘cause this life
Never been this bright
Don’t be foolish, boy, it’s always more to it
Stuck between a rock and a boiling pot
Lead a whole block, leading all for doctors
What you on? I’mma put us on
I ain't talkin' pebbles when I tell em that I'm stoned
Oh so fade, bitch I’m oh so faded
Shine like my life, gold plated
Hungry like it’s Budapest, Shawty who da best?
Roll the mook, let me do the rest, yeah

Ride around on volks, holler at my folks
Got a lot of smoke, pockets on halitos'
Stinky green, stinky green, let me set the scene
Flee the scene and my weapon clean, fiend

That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it

This ain’t Amsterdam, but we go Dutch
Trick, you could pay for your own lunch
You clearly have the wrong one
I mean you clearly must be on one, un uh
You wanna see me? lately see me when it’s all done
Sorry hun, it was all fun, um
Living out my dreams, I don’t need to sleep
Going offroad, I don’t need a Jeep
I’m a leader, sky beaming, I seen it, had a vision
Purple drapes, high ceilings, purple haze, high ceilings
I just keep on getting better, I amaze high ceilings
I Never cap like the snapple fact, matter fact
Make em double back, every fuckin' track – cat attack
Here kitty, catacomb, dead to me
Breakfast in bed, honeycombs and some head for me
Put me in a song, what she said to me
Well alright

Ride around on volks, holler at my folks
Got a lot of smoke, pockets on halitos'
Stinky green, sticky green, let me set the scene
Flee the scene and my weapon clean, fiend

That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it

Uh
Another day, another flight
Another city, what a fuckin’ night
Damn baby, drop that ass, twerk it right
15 stamps in a month that was somethin’ light
Like work, like way
Life’s good, scratch that, life’ great
She’s cool, got that nice cake
Thanksgiving plate, baby I'll scrape
She fend a finale
But she spaz and I wait
A half an hour late
Thicker than a snicker, fuck it i'll wait
She said her date so out dated
They say nothin’ is free but she do it for me
Shorty poppin’ some E then she poppin’ for me
And she rollin’. Yea, she rollin’
Them niggas with me. Yea, my niggas believe
Everything that we need, they gon get it through me
And we rollin’. Yea, we rollin’
2-11 sippin’ on a 6 road
Why you niggas trippin’ like you licking toads?
On another level and them bitches know
So niggas want my seat, I’m like that’s a rope
Kill the noise bitch, I’m a professional
She know it’s comin’, I’m the next to blow
Got her signin’ all the fuckin’ checks with an axonal
All I do is look, yea my shit is exceptional
You slippin’ boy, you f’in low
I’m shinin’, got fluorescent glow
Nigga, climb up to my pedestal
You was lookin’ good right here, never muckin’ boo ras
Smokin’ good ‘round here
Late day, 3-65 that’s a round year
My trip 16 zips that’s a pound there
My chick fantastic, bust it down there
Her lips so thick, yea they pucker down there
They say nothin’ is free but she do it for me
Shorty poppin’ some E then she poppin’ for me
And she rollin’. Yea, she rollin’
Them niggas with me. Yea, my niggas believe
Everything that we need, they gon get it through me
And we rollin’. Yea, we rollin’
Land at la guardia and on the same day
Fly out of JFK, that’s just a play away
Girl, let’s get away
I know you sippin’ pinot chilly like it’s pinot shay
Okay, I’m in the UK like I work out
Bitch, I’m droppin’ down
Scout the club fuckin’ twerked out
Bitch, I’m buyin’ rounds
Mayor out in Gotham
Bitch, I run the town
She say usually it cost ‘em
But I’mma hold you down
They say nothin’ is free but she do it for me
Shorty poppin’ some E then she poppin’ for me
And she rollin’. Yea, she rollin’
Them niggas with me. Yea, my niggas believe
Everything that we need, they gon get it through me
And we rollin’. Yea, we rollin’
Needs Transcribing - Song here!

I'm the maestro, you up in the stands
You should clap your hands when I orchestrate
Running ice so put it in my hands
I'll take you to the land that the coaches pray for
Dreamville, my team so ill that all make heat and we all get paid for it
Rock stages and back stage it was your dream girl she gone wait for us
Two years ago Cole told me bro you gonna blow, just wait for it
So I hone my craft, wasn't a forward of cash
Put my heart of wax I was made for it
Then I wrote a track and he fucked with that
And we shot a vid and he paid for it
It's that organic me and rappers, me and them not the same story
I traveled the atlas before I was rapping
The king was what my parents raised for
Lost in the traffic but my city 
Started trap just to pay for it
A pair of new kicks, hoes stay at my wrist
Didn't impress all them chicks that I craved for
Now I don't even need to say shit
Bitch need I say more? (nah)
This my personal life this a personal right
You can turn from the light then shine on niggas like a baby at birth
Just peeped this first bit of life
Right

Shine, Shine
Shine, Shine

Can't block it where the E clips?
I'm too kush for you I'm too kush for you
I'm too kush for you I'm...

Smoke dank nigga glowin' in the dark
Miss calls like I don't wanna talk
All these snake ass niggas in the grass man
Thinkin' all these dog ass hoes wanna bark
All that talk'll make a nigga leave

It's gettin' late I'm thinkin' hit the beach, girl
Get naked you can take a leap, here
Let's be clear, real nigga shit

366 in a leap year
Every day a nigga cold now, I froze now
I'm torn down, whoa, no
Not lookin' for a hold down, to slow down, just go down low
Got some money I can thrown down
We can go a couple more rounds
We can do it with the roof up but I'm 'bout to make it pour down
I'm throwed now like third down and 17, Super Mookin Fiends
You know the team carry, I got my city on, Brooklyn to Queens
They was lookin' for more till they looked into me
I just got in and out, niggas done had it for a minute man
Why they still lookin' like, rookies to me
I've been committed and all my nigga tryna make a million
Give you my opinion
Fuck with the team, I found a bean in my pocket, wooh
Might pop it in a bit
 and left came back, God damn i'm poppin' in this bitch
Still, all these bitches get is stick from me
RIP that nigga Chivalry
Shout out God to my nigga Shigitty dawg
Will week nigga, every minute we ball
Fuck you Quick, Quick!
Get it regardless
Fucking the game, I hit it the hardest
It won't be the same I give you my word
I never do promises unless I deliver
Life's a bitch but ain't no living unless I forgive her
That's bottles after bottles all this stress on my liver
I don't ever watch the news
They don't ever do no articles about the stress on my niggas
We the best in the business, I'm their Captain-Lieutenant
Cole he caught a jet and rolled
He just point ahead to roll, niggas slept for a minute
Now its over for these hoes claimed the city for my own
Listen when the story told they gone tear, they gone cheer
They gone say the homies home yeah Queens, they gone say the burrows on
Bas

Shit
I'm happy as fuck nigga!
This my last winter
Two Week Notice
Fuck it, I'm not one with speeches nigga
That's it
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted, blasted
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(can you dig)

That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(Mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm so mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)

Pass it, pass it, now I'm blasted
Ash it, ash it stupid bastard
My eyes lower than a casket
My piff greener than the Packers
Or the J.E.T.S
My chicks meaner then the ratchet
Bet my  seedless
My hydro, I call it drastic
That's that shit, have a nigga on a trip
Get a grip, counter grip
Grab a bitch, pound a bitch
Hittin' licks, pounds of piff
I don't ever feel these rapper I can tell they counterfeit
Hop up on the mountain pits

And them hoes they know
The Feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it, light the flame
Super mook, glad you came

That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(Mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm so mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)

Mooking haze everyday, face
Slid up on a base, safe
Sorry copper, I don't take the bait, snake
I just move the weight, cake
While I'm out of state, I go on a date
Then I will penetrate, I don't make mistakes
Feel I'm 'bout to break, I let her decide my fate
She treat me like a shake weight, wait
Count money burn celebratory blunts
Gotta get it cause you only gonna live it once
Tryna own it, I ain't fuckin' with the rented ones
Jamaica Queens, but I take it where it's really from
The sentence of the kush, ascended from the kush
All you mook hoes, do a bear shit in the woods

And them hoes they know
The Feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it, light the flame
Super mook, glad you came, hoes

That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(Mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm so mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)

They wanna cage you in a wood box
Tell you money make the world stop
I wish the motherfuckers would stop
I wish I coulda went to Woodstock
Whole clique piff flame
Make a 4-6 nigga feel 16
Make a broke nigga feel like a rich man
Like a rich man, like a rich man
They wanna cage you in a wood box
Tell you money make the world stop
I wish the motherfuckers would stop
I wish I coulda went to Woodstock
Whole clique piff flame
Make a 4-6 nigga feel 16
Make a broke nigga feel like a rich man
Like a rich man, like a rich man
I'm super mook

And them hoes they know
The Feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it, light the flame
Super mook, glad you came

Hoes
A thousand dollars on one drink later
That bottle from my niggas
Drop knowledge on these hoes
Coke bottle from the figure
Top model when she pose
Bird brain always talking so what's so
Give a fuck about your past please be more current
Try to make waves you gone need more current
You should get you one of these
Heart bigger than a picture couldn't fit it on my sleeve
Hard regale got check, couldn't get me on my knees
Hard liquor, good sex, couldn't get you bitch to leave
Damn, I never said I'm the greatest, but I only get greater
Sixty cities off six teens just half for you later
I just laugh on my haters, you gonna have to excuse
You gone need a jujitsu to cut through half of my layers
I am like the rap Himalayas you can die at the peak
It's such a beautiful sky

You would die for a peak
I always saw it on a bigger scale than the most niggas
I try tell 'em but you can't tell most niggas
We on that Dohchay, Dohchay, Dohchay
Thats the killer, 
Since I've been high, I could always see high
Like a bee hive buzzing, did it whip my nigga
Really we like cousins annd if you see life frontin'
Gun it and chase that bitch but when you take that risk
It's a double xord my nigga hit the feds while he had to make that flip
I put the paper to lyrics make sure my crew full
That something useful
Make sure you make it the fruit fall
You want eat as much shit as you choose to

Shout out to by nigga Ron Gilmore
Nigga was like you need to rap on this beat
So I was like you know I'm going to rap on this beat
When they see you are inferior do not believe a word they say. Fiends. Resist. When they say they need billions of dollars to build bonds instead of schools open your eyes. Fiends. Resist. When they say they want to reserve our way of life so they must take life, this is a lie. Resist. Super Mook. Speak truth of power, do not comply.

Listen up, I'm gone like ET
No prone alloy, all white GT
Waking up early morning not easy
Bas is a fiend, snort 'til at least 3
Coming up, watch me peak
White home with a loan, this not DC, but I be the president
Run the confederate of the generous
Well, bitches never sell a bit
Trying to get in my city better sell a bit
Sell a bit, sell 'Piff, nigga sell a brick
Sell tricks up, make your stretch boy
New Jigster, that's my next toy
Going like Wall Street after exploits
Off that, bomb weed that I explore
Calmly, board the next plane at the airport
Where I'm going? Who knows
Anywhere it ain't snowing with two hoes
Penthouse, condo with two floors
Dipping through minor coke and two doors
New ports, shit, they ain't hotter than me
Kick up my feet like an  G'
Wake up, my bed makes itself
Bake up, inhale, take deep breath

Do not believe. Do not accept. Do not be afraid. Do not surrender. Do not judge. Super Mook. Do not  against my neighbor.

So high I can never find a fucking thing
But I always find my fucking bling
Where was I?
Riding on the rings
Saturn, swagger, got me all rapping out of pattern
Smoking good, give your bitch wood like a tavern
If they could, bet them niggas would
Doesn't matter, cause they can't serve them hoes
They ain't on a platter, took my bank
Eminem, nigga Marshall Mathers
That's a couple milli' hoe, stuntin' like a video
Burning on the piccolo, green
New York City Fiend
City colder than the ghoster
EDM mean
Streets like a cobra, until you get bitten you probably wouldn't even know what I mean
They ask, but they never know what I seen
So busy trying to scheme a nigga forgot to dream
I'm dreamin' lucid
Chess not checkers ya'll niggas stupid
Bet's not check cause ya'll niggas foolish
Bas serve 'em hot ya'll at the 
Damn, revenge is a dish best served cold
So, I wish that to them assholes
Yeah, wave goodbye to my last goals
Set sight on the flag poles
Bas
Ay Ced
My nigga just roll one, let the storm settle
Feel like a lightning storm and I'm on metal
Feel like this life is a long walk thru nights to long coats with knives and nigga we all cattle
Crabs in a bucket this is a small barrel
.38 mag blast yo ass with a long barrel
Boy meet the devil
Tell him come off you apparel
For that pearly white ice, your life is in peril
The needle ain't sterile
The wound is infected
Broke as a joke
So the wounded neglected
This ain't a joke tho, it's foolish to mess with a man on the edge
Shit that's just a death wish
You in some shit now
Float in the septic
Pitch em your goals but the throw intercepted
Your niggas is grimey
Your ho is deceptive
Highway to life and theres only one exit
But fuck it I veer off a road that is less followed  
The orchestra led and the guests followed
The trumpets blow leave your chest hollow
Violins play your sins on the strings and it sing it go

We want mula (mula)
Yea we want mula
Oh we want mula (mula)
Yea we want mula
Hmmm
Yea thats what the fiends want (and I'm a fiend)
Said thats what the fiends want (nigga)
Yea thats what the fiends want (and im a fiend)
Said thats what the fiends want (nigga)

How come everywhere I go I see a liquor store?
How come that nigga a vet but yet that nigga broke?
How come a nigga gotta die for you remember me?
How come the middle of July feel like Decemeber?
See the summer time is killing season
Kiss my momma every day boy I'm barely breathing
Bunch of heathens round me rather see me under cement
Paranoia but this mook will keep me off the deep end
So much beef in these city streets
I pray you go vegan
War torn from war stories man where do we begin
Niggas is carbon dioxide just waitin to seep in
While you sleepin leave your brain matter splattered and leaking
Find a pastor a deacon, rabbi or imam
Tryna fly my way to heaven but this turbulence is strong
My momma taught me right
My city taught me wrong
They say I'm on my way
I pray it won't be long
Need sunshine leave the city unwind
Shine so hard God the city leave son blind
The city is unkind
The city get no sleep
I rummage her underworld
The city is so deep
And it preach

We want mula (mula)
Yea we want mula
Oh we want mula (mula)
Yea we want mula
Hmmm
Yea thats what the fiends want (and I'm a fiend)
Said thats what the fiends want (nigga)
Yea thats what the fiends want (and im a fiend)
Said thats what the fiends want (nigga)
SMF
SMF

I'm super mooooooooked
I'm super mooooooooked
Fiend
Yo Quick turn me up
Ha, fuck it
Fiends, super mook

Dyke niggas actin' like a bunch of women scorned
Haters form like ice after winter storms
Never play along, bag a chick, girl let's make a porn
Make a sandwich bitch
Make a marriage, strip, go south like you on a van with
Split like the grams me and my man get, gotta feed the fam, understand this
8 balls, underhand pitch, snitch crawl, under sand ditch
Paint a perfect picture would you be my canvas? my name is in the scripture my makin' to plan this
I panoramic panned it, life banned it, 8 cylinder like , like tanned chick, outstanding
I planned it, outstanding, good things come to those who wait
But hey, I want that cake right now, take a bitch on a sober date
What I look like? hit the gate, and board a flight cloud it formed
You are now in the right crowd when you hear that weak shit, tell them niggas pipe down
Fiend bitch, get her beak wet, mirror wipe down
She show me the secrets, she'll show you the night gown, Husband slash life clown
Dumb dumb sit yo ass down, that's game
Like Drake, bitch Thank me Later, New York Yankee, fuck you, hater
Big crib, mad trees, don't see my neighbor, just see that paper
Yeah she's a stand up chick but shit, I layed her, I layed her, yeah she's a stand up chick, but shit, I layed her, I layed her
Yeah she's a stand up chick, but shit, I layed her, I layed her

Fiend Bitch
I thank god for the blizzard, we snowed in
Girl you lookin' like you rode in on a piff cloud
Was it frozen? and where the piff now? are you holdin'?
Cause I damn sure is lil' mama, newsflash, this shit potent
Lil' mama leave ya baggage at the door, please check yo shit
Cause that's yo biz, lil' mama me and you
Well we here for another reason
It's December but i'm feelin' like another season
Cause the flowers in June gon' sing a love tune
And a howl at the moon, tell her bring ya love soon
Sharper than a harpoon, yeah, shorty wetter than a monsoon
Yeah, I read your colors like a cartoon
But this purple say we depart soon, gone

Can we take a little trip?
We'll be gone couple hours
We don't need a private jet
Shorty get up on this dower

You take me high like a seaside tidal wave
Final days we spend 'em confined inside a cave
With a moat of Hennessy, marijuana blaze
Liquor flowin' in the sleet, whole 'lotta haze
Whole 'lotta chicks wanna take ya place though
You the only one I could never replace though
They might replicate yo style
Can't replicate yo smile, you on hold
Ain't no doubt, could you wait here for a while?
Could you be the one that's always gon' look out for me?
See them birds on my arm and know it's falconry
Cause you elevate me higher than a balcony
But when you high, girl you always start to doubtin' me
Why? I know, that kush is paranoia
Type of shit to make 'em look and think they never saw ya
I ain't toyin' wit ya girl, I'm tryna tell ya
I'll be ya Ray Liotta, now that's a good fella

Can we take a little trip?
We'll be gone couple hours
We don't need a private jet
Shorty get up on this dower

We super mooked, high, I look in ya eyes
And, ask you if you down to take a ride, yeah
Stroll up on a prairie house and steal the pie from 'em
No need to roll another one cause you a fly woman
Kind woman, divine woman
But if you disrespect  Genghis Khan woman
I'm pullin' for you cause you marathon runnin'
Life is so cruel you had better times honey but
It's always stormy 'fore the beautiful day
And, sometimes you corny in the cutest of ways
And, a bit annoying cause you blew all my haze, but it's cool
Now you horny cause you blew all my haze
Got me in a daze girl, yeah, cause ya strength make me brave girl
Take a gaze, I know it's dark, but me and you?
Could never get estranged world

Can we take a little trip?
We'll be gone couple hours
We don't need a private jet
Shorty get up on this dower
