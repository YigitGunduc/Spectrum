It's either, them or you
It's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know
You do what you do to stay alive

Niggas don't want war—I'm a martian, with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right; your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite; I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts—like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit—'bout to inaugurate
My P.E.-conglomerates 'bout to P-E-E on any wanna-B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame-spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of the adora, my heart go
"Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom-boom"
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that 'K
Like every day in every way, and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is, "Pray"
'Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know what's hit them—through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best—I'm like, "You're so right"
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass-corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E., Public Enemy, Assassinate us—bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything, son
Fuck government, fuck—listenin' and shit
You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads

It's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Stopped spitting fire 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, my man the flyest with it
With a mind of fine of interest for your finest interests
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
'Cause P.E.'s about to take off
With protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin', "Fuck censorship!"
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
'Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzi's 'cause its given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man’s tryna disrespect it
Send a message and it's over in a millisecond—nigga
Money ain't a thing if I got it
Mo-mo-money ain't a thing if I got it
Money

Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough

Yo, sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men
Pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same
Since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch what you dishing and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep ducking down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose
Foes keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them
The Pros been on a mission
Listen, enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' Macs, I raise steaks to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis
I got dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due

Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here (It ain't  easy)
Just trying to get a deal out here
(Money ain't a thing if I got it)
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene (Joey Badass)
Cause cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
(Won’t sign to no major if no wager) (money ain't a thing)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills (It ain't easy)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all

Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough
Mother, mothersucker, yeah, oh, this is what you want, huh?
Microphone checker, yo, yo, yo

Uh, motherfuckin' microphone checker
Keep that grip tight, like my Smith & Wesson
Ike with the mic, which nigga tryna turn up?
Hit you with the hurtful fuckin' truth like Sojourner
Motherfuckin' microphone eater
Spittin' hot shit, hit ya dome with the heater
Wouldn't want to be ya, dish lyrical fajitas
Got dragon balls like my name was Vegeta
Motherfuckin' super duper swankin'
Niggas still hatin', pigs want him for the bacon
Take 'em to the slaughterhouse, say we 'bout to order out
Tell 'em we the badass motherfuckers that they heard about
Yes, I guess the word is out, we comin' for the top dollar
Top rottweiler, since I popped my collar
Niggas say they hit us, they ain't ever shot nada
Me? I'd rather not snitch up on my own problems
Cause I'm a microphone killer
Especially when my head is gone off the liquor
Specially educated, heavily medicated
Give me that beat and I'll put you next to Dilla (My nigga)
Flow sweeter than vanilla
Tell these haters beat it, can't Jackson thriller
I'm the nigga that you see when you're in the mirror
Say my name five times, this what I deliver

This a motherfuckin' nuke that I'm droppin'
The world in my pocket, kick you out your continent
Always drop hot shit, Toroidal Flow keep constant
And I won't stop 'til I reach Christ Conscious, nigga

Which one of y'all niggas really want it with me?
None of y'all niggas, fuck outta here
Beast coast, nigga, Pro Era in your area

This a motherfuckin' nuke that I'm droppin'
The world in my pocket, kick you out your continent
Always drop hot shit, Toroidal Flow keep constant
And I won't stop 'til I reach Christ Conscious, nigga

Niggas know, niggas, niggas, niggas know
Check it, word word
What's the word word
Yeah, check!

Just got word from my mans on the island
He said he needed guidance
Niggas on the streets is wilding, he look to God but can't find him
So he demand silence from the glaring sirens
The sympathy symphony, only thing playing is the banned violence
No lying niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn your molecules until you let go ions
Treat beef like they let go lions
So don't eye 'em they get the wrong message, wrong methods
Put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure, God bless ya when the semi wet'cha
They told me "more dress-up" I'm giving too many lectures
And I'm putting in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
Like "they gon' catch up" fuck what you must heard!
But I done puffed enough herb
To be listening to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough shit on my mind
So I don't need to be stressing and shine, it's fine

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Got a collect call from up top
My cousin called me and whatnot
The motto never changed it’s still fuck cops
We went from having lunch in our lunchbox
Our lungs was hot whenever we'd puff pot
We'd touch blocks and end up having to duck shots
But fuck dot, ain’t trying live that life no more
My mind corrupted but my heart is still pure
Gotta be brave can’t be afraid
Braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade
Trapped in a maze and your faith is your only escape
Fuck a priest’s opinion, knock the hinges off of Heaven’s gates
Trying to share my cells with my mate, not share a cell with mates
Wrecking shit with my recklessness
The L get lit that’s when I start second guessing shit
Thinking ‘bout Ty and then I reminisce
What you thought you niggas could’ve fuck me over
Never nigga guess again
I’m street so cross me like pedestrians
And that’s gon' be the end of it, straight revoking your membership

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Niggas wanna know what I’m about, I’m bout blowing loud
On the block sporty, Glock 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out commission with my composition
Who the kid spitting behind the bars like a con position
Gotta give ‘em time to listen, they’ll soon bump to it
They’ll like me, I kick it like Nike they’ll soon adjust to it
But if you hate I know you must do it
I ain’t mad at you I keep my attitude on "screw it a million bucks should do it"
I’m out for presidents to represent me
Yo chick keep messaging me, who the bestest MC? They be mentioning me
Too hot, I be molesting the beat, fuck math
Teachers should teach us to get Smith & Wesson’s off of the street
So first class be a lesson for me
Fuck what you teaching for some regents, I'm flying over regions
Reaching, all time highs where Jesus can’t reach us
Censor me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers, hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot, Glock cocked watching out for cops
All about their cheddar, young guns know nothing that’s better
Like fuck a prison letter, those Beretta’s led us to the lettuce
Relish fetishes, menaces want the senator’s percentages
If you ain't prejudice you still a nemesis
Smoking on the Clematis, get open like a present is
Now your presence is on the premises for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linking terrorists from the Stuy to Lincoln Terraces
Stay on that reckless shit, they leave you left for the dead
Kids don’t play they’ll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slinging some regs, popping some meds
Jakes be so deep in cover they be chasing the feds
I be back stage gripping haze breaking my leg
My folks was making the best when they was naked in bed, muthafucka

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this
Yeah, you remember back in the days
When niggas used to rock waves and shit?
When like, yo, I had the fucking 360s, my nigga
Like nobody in the hood was fucking with my shit
And that's real shit

Uhh, since '9-5, momma been working nine-five
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
So we pray to the Gods, the Jahs and the Allahs
To keep us safe and watch our lives
Cause all we tryna do is do good
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods
Cause these niggas these days is loco
You'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna go global
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul
And I’m hopeful that me spittin it soulful
Will have me in the Daily Postal, flying coastal, eatin tofu
Like I told you, I know niggas who trash rappin
Worried bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin' passion
They want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter
Right after I start laughin, they start askin "What happened?"
But back to the chapter
Momma told me follow dreams, should never have to ask her, to
So that’s what I do, became an MC master
Since then it’s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
Go ahead ask em, "Who's Joey Bad?"
Watch em gasp, asthma, damn it’s so sad
He paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up
Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due
Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals
Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found in your retinal
Uh, and they told me not to be so complex
Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex
And The Source, alfredo of course
There I go again, steppin out of line, runnin' off course
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk
For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north
Speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost
Unless with some form of divorce, or a corpse
Born boss, no days off, child labor
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes
Yeah

What the rap audience ain't ready for is a real person
You know what I wanna say: a real N-I-G-G-A
I'm coming at 'em 100% real, I ain't compromising nothin'
Anybody that talk about me got problems, you know what I'm sayin'
It's gonna be straight-up, like if I was a street person
That's how I'm comin' at the whole world
And I'm being real about it and I'mma grow with my music

Yeah, but it's far from over
Won't stop 'til I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover
'Til I'm an owner of the world's finest motors
I blow like supernovas in your daughter's room on a poster
Known as history's biggest musical composer
No disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stoner
Marijuana my odor, and when I get older
Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
Like three times, have three kids, I hope
Me & wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
I hope they acknowledge the knowledge
Cause yeah, they gon need it
Cause when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it
Couldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils
Felt bad when I learned that their advice was truly useful
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual
Even though over time, my punishments, they grew more crucial
Should use the word brutal, cause my parents mad strict
Hope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib
Go gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered
Until then, all I can do is imagine
Imagine, I'ma make it all happen
And we smoking, toking potent herb
Preaching spoken words that just might poke your nerves
Hope you ain't scared, my jeep go "Scrrrr"
I peep the obscured, and what ain't normally easy to observe
I swear I'm born abnormally absurd
If I give you a piece of mind, you've been disorderly disturbed
That's my word, flip similes and verbs, now I'm eating
Retreating for seconds and thirds, y'all niggas seasoned
(Oh, you salty)
Don't worry what we ate, you don't want that plate
I combine yours with mine quake, and make the earth shake
Supernatural disaster on you half-ass rappers
Pass the herb to an actual pastor, word to the black lip bastard
I drop knowledge like a Five Percenter
Every time I drop a line, it touch like five placentas
Schooling your offspring, drop heat all spring
And stay hot for five Novembers, I think y'all niggas lost me

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find
95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time

Instead of lead slugs, I spreads the love
Like a bed bugaboo does, I'm in the W with your lovable slut
I'm in the walls while you bugging her up
I'll do your girl like this beat, straight fucking it up
Y'all niggas nothing to us, this feels like nuttin' to us
Son, taught your daughter how to bust a nut for fun
Recollect and collect the funds
When she see the sun spit the proceeds when I cum
'99, 'til infinity beyond
Hold my peace full of energy 'til enemies be gone
Until then niggas in my vicinity gone
Peep the melody we on
But they don't know the remedy to these songs
Basic necessities on how to be put on
Cause they see my team, we strong, Beastcoast in your region
If you get dropped you can't rejoin, they wanna know
Whose shoulder we leaning on
But all we do is show them who we leading on

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find
95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time

Cause they will never stop for a young black male
Blackmailed in braille that means what he felt
And the very reveal could appeal
Put you on the Alcatraz trail or railroad to hell
Oh well, some of us is taught there is help
The other source is lost in all sorts of wealth
Uh, roots of all evil
The highest stars Evel Knievel
I see through people's door, the world may never know
How my third pupil show, Incognito and cold needles flow
And I don't throw subs, I throw torpedoes
The Don, not Cheadle, this don got a Cornelius fro
Afro punk festivities
This for my negus that's lying with queens like Nefertiti
Waking up to pyramids and big kitties
Gold soul theory, but what is life really

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find
95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time
Yeah, you know sometimes I think
They don't truly understand me, you know
Cause they don't, yeah, uh

Can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today that's worthwhile
Will for sure inspire actions in your first child
I'll begin my verse now

Sometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words
Like I'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe
I feel my ancestors unrested inside of me
It's like they want me to shoot my chance in changing society
But how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?
My destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart
You told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?
Except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle
They built for us
The first step into change is to take notice
Realize the real games that they tried to show us
300 plus years of them cold shoulders
Yet 300 million of us still got no focus
Sorry America, but I will not be your soldier
Obama just wasn't enough, I need some more closure
And Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over
Let’s face facts 'cause we know what’s the real motives

In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
Still got the last names of our slave owners
In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners, yeah

We can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action, hold up, yeah, uh

Trickery in the system, put my niggas in prison
All our history hidden, ain't no liberty given
We all fit the description of what the documents written
We been lacking the vision and barely making a living
We too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'
Every time you submittin', we all guilty admit it
The Lord won't get you acquitted, but you still ask for forgiveness
Put opiates in syringes then inject his religion
How many times do I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission
Many times I gotta tell you I don't need no permission
A human with super vision, ain't no livin' condition
I'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen
Start a new coalition against corrupt politicians
It's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions
Another family evicted, another black man a victim
That's as real as it's getting, you should take recognition

In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
Still got the last name of our slave owners
In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners, yeah

We can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action in your first child, yeah
Yeah, can you feel it? (yeah)

I used to feel so devastated
At times, I thought we'd never make it
But now we on our way to greatness (greatness, greatness)
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I used to feel so devastated (yeah)
At times I thought we'd never make it (yeah)
But now we on our way to greatness (yeah)
And all that ever took was patience (yeah)

Okay, just gettin' better each day
Stackin' that cheddar, cheesecake
Look up to the Lord, we pray, tryna be my best each day
And 'til I'm laid to rest we lay, yeah
'Til the time bein', we lit
Hopin' I don't let it get all in my head
I don't need the money just to say that I'm rich
Couple little honeys wanna get in my bed
But they used to run from me when I had nothin'
Now they want to fuck 'cause they see me stuntin'
Nigga came up off the hustlin'
Livin' in the lap of lux and I'm feelin' like the man
If you ain't in my Chucks, then you wouldn't understand
Homie, 'bout these rubberbands on me
Make her wanna dance for me
Prolly leave her man for me, standin' in the stands, goddamn
(She used to front way back, now she just a fan, yeah)

I used to feel so devastated
At times, I thought we'd never make it
But now we on our way to greatness (greatness, greatness)
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I used to feel so devastated (yeah)
At times I thought we'd never make it (yeah)
But now we on our way to greatness (yeah)
And all that ever took was patience (yeah)

I put my pain on the cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowin' and sailin'
So just go with the feelin'
Baby, soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes
I put my pain in the cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowin' and sailin'
So just go with the feelin'
Baby, soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, skrrt skrrt
Woo, yeah

I used to feel so devastated
At times, I thought we'd never make it
But now we on our way to greatness (greatness, greatness)
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I used to feel so devastated (yeah)
At times I thought we'd never make it (yeah)

I used to feel so (so devastated)
At times I thought we'd (we'd never make it)
Now we on our way (yeah, yeah)
And all that ever took was patience
We done came up
Everybody love ‘em
On the regular

Lookin’ at popular colored faces
Observing what my brothers faces in all races
Lost in generations before hatred
See with your eyes dilated for the sake of the Gs
But keep it sacred G, fuck a rat race, we take the cheese
Jack cheddar from the make believe
Break the trees on they eighth CD
Rocking the red and black lumberjack faithfully
I’m a Brooklyn nigga, basically I grind with the grimiest
Learn how to eat in the jungle full of hyenas
And vultures, don’t worry what a verse will cost ya
From the young scorcher, just remember who taught ya
Imma spark it off unorthodox
Won’t sign to no major if no wager
Less than a 3 million offer off the top
I’ll be in a box with my coughin’ drops
Why settle for a office spot?
Niggas don’t always make it off the block
Unless they extort rocks or support the cops
They still snitchin’ - let me guess: that’s your mannequin?
Leave ‘em shook while you’re standing and quit the shenanigans
Have you panicking, induce damages ‘til you’re vanishing
Words are told properly, resort top sea examinin'
This is for my real hip hop fans and ‘em
I dispose for 'em, leave fake MC’s in the post mortem

Cause money ain’t a thing if I got it I won’t spend
All I got is my Pros, I don’t need no friends
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end
The only soul that won’t sin
No he won’t give in
Yo this world is bone chillin’
Make meals in hell’s kitchen with these dishes
Properly delivered drop trees in my swisher
And bring that back to my property wit ya

It ain’t easy being this royal
When you got this much going for you
It ain’t hard to be disloyal
Comin’ straight from the soil with lines that never coil
Start to think pretty off new career with this spoil
The kid is that sick so expect more coffins
I’m the chosen one so you can expect more offerings
I be sonning niggas so expect less orphans
Best rapper alive hear that line used less often
Word to God I’m the best offering
BMX like Hoffman, BMF like Boss-man
Young boss, man, got Jimmy Fallon endorsements
From porches, to Porsches, getting portions of fortune
They said next up so I stepped up
Fly like I dressed up
Bitches try to hang like left nuts
Like orangutans in the west of
Of the motherland, but I’ve got the swank of no other man
Brother man
They can’t understand
Pro Era boys pop rubber band


Everybody love ‘em
We done came up
I’ma spark it off unorthodox
They don’t feel the name, but they say the music dope though
I’ma spark it off unorthodox
On the regular
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight

Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit

Started blazing, and stargazing
See how you can reach your farthest aspirations
It's like holy matrimony in the matrix
It ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift
Cold feet cause I'm on thin ice
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night
Like, you can't skip steps is the best
Even though the vets hold a .47 with a vest
Now that's a wise investment
Or a concept to try and hide divine intentions
Like, let em hate, stay calm and meditate
When life has the lemons it's time to eliminate
More sour than lemonade, anyways
Different days, different highs, different haze
Kama sutra with miss Mary Jane
And the karma suits her, she a vibrant thang

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside

Cause I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit

You niggas is suspect and I'm just a ruffneck
That wasn't breaking pencil tips when I would bust lead
I puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead
Her cunt wet, she getting rough sex, no sunset
I like a chick with a buck tooth, yeah it could get fucked too
We keep one eye open, they sus too
Never tell em my government, make any covenant bitches be loving it
Say not to put a glove on it, some funny shit
You must've thought I was a dummy, miss
I feed lines to felines just to get up in their tummies quick
Yeah you got tricks but I got five more
So any game you try to play, you better know I got the high score
You better settle down cause you not on my level now
The Pros is semi-circle, they can tell the world you get around
Some niggas clowns, what's the shit about?
They used to doubt now they see us sprout and I'm out

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside

Nigga I deserve my respect
And brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit

When I was thirteen, I was bad, rapping 'bout guns we never had
Now we smoke raws with filter tips, old homies talking shit
Said you got what's best of mine but you stay plotting on that dime
Thought cause we was cool before that we gon' take yo ass on tour?
Fuck nah, this my chance to get it
How you entitled to my shine? Nigga you ain't help me get it
Now these niggas see me getting it, check the statements on my debit
My profile get requested but I never hit "accept"
Hit the sour to the chest, I reflect
When I was fourteen, up late, eyes glued to the sampler screen
Eyes beam, cause we can make it better
Smoking on that Jack Herer, welcome to the Progressive Era

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight

Cause I deserve my respect
And brains don't matter but tell me what really matters
When you pissed off at the world like you got a crazy bladder
And, momma always said that shit don't come on silver platters
So I gather my thoughts and make use of all these synonyms
Cause I could never swallow the truth, like it's cinnamon
Excuse me if I'm militant
The sinning men in my hood could leave a nigga quivering
Like goddamn, deliver him, the venom and his liver is
Corrupting all his ligaments
Now he's at a standstill so tell me if he'll live again
The fire in his heart, still seem to be simmering
Now take that little simmer and turn it into adrenaline
Penicillin could not stop the drive he be giving em like mad fours
But fast forward, let's get to the part where his records
Could 'ford him a couple Fords like "Lord, ain't he gifted?"
Christmas just doesn't fit him, I need my own holiday
And by the way, I'mma possibly own Monopoly
And all McDonald's property cause I won't live in poverty like

In the clouds come and find me son, I'm flier than Hermione
Homie tripping, got em sounding like Hansen in the nineties
Charlie Manson your whole body cause that damage in your party
Can you manage what I'm dishing out? Go get your wishing count
You sell me something then I flip that amount
I just switched that account, get that profit then I'm out
Yeah, they all wonder but it's Nyck bitch don't doubt
Rip your lips off your mouth
Man I'm violent ring the siren with these bars I'm reciting
Cars with no license
Hard man, I'm feeling like a spartan with a trident
Damn, picture perfect, bet I'll make that picture worth it
I'll be doubling my spot, no Louisiana Purchase
So declare that, with my hair back
You want a fair one, catch a fair smack
I hunt up on my prey
So pray I ain't hunting on your ass today like be afraid

Cool cuts flow, the deli can't touch this
Slipping like fishes, choking when you hit the cypher
And I ain't talking weed smoke but I let the weed blow
Anything, just let the leaves know, oh
Sucka's fuck around, get clapped where you rest at
Nigga saying you cracking, fire break you imagination
Ask your lady
It's assassin when I come up on the track
It's a curse that I always try to find sex in these verses
But I got your attention, it's part of my ascension
But if I keep toking this strain
It's gonna leave me stranded in this dimension
Or to mention, niggas is snitching
Might charge me with battery
But fuck that, cause piss was never in your anatomy
So don't try to lie on a nigga that got mine on my third eye shit

And they see we getting love cause they see the Pros is winning
Cause we giving love back so they peeping how we fitting
Ain't gonna have no sus nigga stepping to me
I like to keep my chakras open so respect my G
I got the bush going in, repping FPT
So sus niggas watch your back, Pros next to me
I got Chuck on the team to collect the green
And show these suspect niggas what it mean to scheme
Another apex predator crushing your dreams
Gonna get your wig pushed back between my cream
Taking all you sus niggas, throw you out the scene

Unless you disrespect, I wreck you verbally
So expect the worst from me, I beck you with my intellect
You best be circumspect check, made you making all the wrong moves
Do I intimidate you, or more infuriate you?
Cause I annihilate all who participating for the gore
Lovers I decapitate with everything I say, see
Come sneak a peak and, tell me what you peeping
Then struggle to say it ain't greatness that you seeing
It is what here sits in the midst of us, yeah it's quite mysterious
No you're not delirious, I'm serious, it's clear to us
Add some crystals, gonna see gold
Then platinum, seen it on some tarots before
So I know how it is all gonna go down
Gotta go more uptown, more in the cloud
Cause didn't ya know by now, I'm skyline bound
And my time's now, I don't graze ground, I'm new in your town
So assume what you please but you don't know me
Say what you please but you don't know T'nah

Who that mofo that came to showboat just cause he float like no other?
Style smooth as butter and slick like lubricant rubbers
So going in on tracks ain't a real test, the real quest
Is making real tracks with feelings people ain't feel yet
Dessy be that suspect for subjects for all the records
Set in for all the records, I spit in a split of seconds
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds
Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line-up
The bars that I could line up could probably bump the fine up
Define what never can judge, rap is in my blood
So much, my capularies adapted a sanctuary
From the 5th of January, every punchline turned into crunch time
Was cutting records more times than my school's lunch line
So if this hits mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine
Been spitting dirty, the vocals recording spit shine

Suspect niggas don't come outside

'Til the day I die, I'll be puffing lye, fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is ours
Get as high as ours, maybe you could see the towers
Scour your dirty mind and maybe you unleash the power
We all got the potential in our body and soul, probably you know
I found mines right through the pencil, started bodying flows
But fuck that, this be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval
I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to squeal
This one for my people, headed to the top, no redo
Thinking up evil but see no evil, just be knievel
Cause I ain't ask to be this good, they just made me better
They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar
And the green only made me clever
See God made three Bigs, two Pacs, but he only made one error
The Era

Yes, strawberries

I'm a beast with these flows
Two birds, one stoned, you get geese’d when trees rolled
They say I'm evil cause I trained my ego to see gold
Cause he know, seagulls couldn't see these goals, please
It's the return of the Beast Coast
No cash flashed, but the cheese still make teeth show
Incognito, is how you move on the strip
What you tryna be Vito? Well there's rules to this shit
Don't get clapped, y'all ain't real spitters, y'all lips chapped
Better watch it, Mr. Nice Watch, don't risk that
I got a six-pack of bare skill that I spill like that
And everybody know (that shit crack!)
Y'all niggas softspoken, down below choking
The type to drop the soap when you soakin' in front of most men
There's makes sense why you want beef, well this frozen
It's nuts for you screwed in the tool, and can't hold em
Better shoot yourself Plaxico, because I'm next to go
The Progressive flows from New York to New Mexico
My lyrical span is what the fans is demandin'
Step into my box and that's exactly what'chu stand in
Ain't no half steppin' around me
And you gotta drown a fish before you clown me
The young cop killer, I'm that ill, so doc' will ya
Give me two shots for 2Pac killer, nigga

Soul searchin' 'til my flows are perfect
I ain't tryna be a slave to grow old from workin'
Sorry Bada$$, you lucky that I peeped it second
Tell them niggas keep it steppin' with they beat selection
Check the melodies, it's so heavenly
That shit'll get your hipster move with no 7D's
Audi-opium, can I bust soliloquies?
Got that shit mix and mastered, both remedies
Grab a spoonful, we sturrin' up a pot
And you know we gotta serve it while it's hot
I'm flowin' like a volcano and drippin' verses off the top
Dirty cops still swervin' on the block
Lookin' for black kids, that spittin' up acid
It's in my jeans so don't worry what my pants is
Get with the script, it's that ignorant shit
And they bound to get sick of us quick but I ain't sealin' my lips
It's a shift, I know you feel it man
We blowin' up like a ceiling fan
Droppin' off jewels like Killa Cam's man
When it comes to kickin' verses, I'm Mr. Van Damme
Crushin' strawberries, it's a jam
So throw up both hands if you can
Ironic how I'm killin' this shit, until they bury me
My volume is going in depth with longevity
Stupids
I come here today to talk about how I feel
And I feel like that we are treated differently than other people
And I don't like how we’re treated
Just because of our color doesn't mean anything to me

This just the way I feel
Mind's been racing so long, yeah
It’s just no way to deal
With these problems alone

And I really can't take it no more
I've been fighting temptations, my Lord
I'm young and I'm restless
(And I really can't help it)
I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord, can you help me?
(I said Lord, can you help me?)

Now everybody got problems, yeah
But wouldn't know what way to solve ’em
I really came up from the bottom
Strugglin’, my momma on her last dollar
Hustlin' and I’ve been puttin' in these hours
The government been tryna take away what's ours
It's really all about the money and the power
I just wanna see my people empowered
Uh, uh, tell me how we gon’ shape this vision
Complainin' all day, but in the same condition
If you wanna make change, it's gon' take commitment
Some people enslaved by they religion
Can't emancipate them from the mental prisons
What I seen through optics transform to wisdom
Watch me use my prophets, get 'em all to listen
I've been on a mission, ah

And I really can't take it no more
I've been fighting temptations, my Lord
I'm making them restless
(And I really can't help it)
I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord, can you help me?
(I said Lord, can you help me?)

Now everybody got vices, yeah
But wouldn't know what good advice is
Until they leave 'em lifeless
Another mama cryin', it's another crisis
Lord knows we just tryna live righteous
Are you willin' just to make the sacrifices?
I know we can't continue livin' like this
And I'll never sell my soul 'cause that's priceless, uh, uh
Tell me how we gon' make a livin'
Hustle on the block, who gon' save the children?
Man it's all a plot and I'm just revealin'
The media just tryna make a villain
I just take the pain and a paint a picture
Voices in my head, I hear the whispers
When I feel this way, inhale the swisher
Or I sip the liquor, ah

And I really can't take it no more
I've been fighting temptations, my Lord
I'm making them restless
(And I really can't help it)
I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord, can you help me?
(I said Lord, can you help me?)

This just the way I feel
Mind's been racing so long, yeah
It's just no way to deal
With these problems alone

And I really can't take it no more
I've been fighting temptations, my Lord
I'm making them restless
(I said, Lord can you help me?)
I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord, can you help me?
(I said Lord, can you help me?)

Do not stop
We are black people and we shouldn't have to feel like this
We shouldn't have to protest because you are treating us wrong
We do this because we need to and we have rights

Fuck jumping the broom, honey moons, I, I hit the pot
Soak me up like a mop, know I'm up, know there's levels
Staring down at the devil, hello, guess I got the memo
Pulling strings like Geppetto, you just a puppet, fellow
I came out of the tomb, don’t drop a L, uh
You don't want to see the evils, which I dwell in hell
To excel, this shit never fails, always excels
They been swallowing sons before the double XL
Sex cell, ex ask why it never work out
I guess I exercise too much, when I work out
Shows too turnt out, return home burnt out
Now I got to hear all the shit, that you heard 'bout
Can I live? What, these niggas want me off a bridge?
If I say it's turnt down, do I burn that shit?
Truth is, if it ain't real, I don't feel it
If it don't hit my spirit, I don't get near it
And that's point blank period, know some niggas that fear it
Same niggas who know that we the illest
Lines so deep a great shark is what I reel up
Hit the flow and it can't go realer, my whole camp gorillas, nigga

I stand juxtaposed to all my Pro's, realest illest niggas I know
See these foes biting the flows, they even jooks the pose
I guess my CD really shaking the coast
Cause this really be the year that I feast, capisce?
Nothing defeats the beast, I speak my piece
Know niggas in the streets that heat seek for me
Release and squeeze
Might put a Halloween between your spleen
Retreat or trickle down to your last pound of green
Know what I mean?
This shit is like taking candy from the babies
Under these rappers is just a bunch of Now and Laters
They too sweet, plus they lease their Mercedes
Can't be second greatest, I'm the best and def your favorite
My flow in-depth nigga, I got my wave up
It's either get your tidal waved, or you could be my neighbor
Cause if I can't eat, then you can't either
I need to know, need the pizza dough, fuck I'm spitting ether for?

Yeah nigga
Reigning rap supreme in this bitch
Cause bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too
Cause bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too
Bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too
Bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too

Welcome back y'all, you're listening to WPRO Brooklyn. That was "Big Dusty", the new single from Joey Bada$$ and I am turning on the A/C 'cause that joint is hot. Joey is here in the studio with us right now. Say "Hi" Joey and tell the people where you from. Yeah, is this mic on? Oh yeah, like, you know, I'm from, I come from Brooklyn, New York. You know, I was born and raised but ah, my my parents from the Caribbean. You know, my ma's from St. Lucia and my pa's from Jamaica. So, you know I play pretty close to my roots
Say Brain, what do you wanna do tonight?
The same thing we do every night, Pinky
Try to take over the world!
Who the fuck is this Joey Bada$$ nigga, son?

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow? Point 'em out bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic?

Check!
Puffin' on stramonium, underground like potholes but going fossil
These bars like art in the Smithsonian
These flows is for custodians, homeless men, horny OBGYN dudes
Browsing my laptop lookin' at red fallopian tube
They like "Yo Joey, you rude", I'm like "If only you knew
I'm only in school for cosmology, that's why I act as lonely as you"
You see I'm wise behind my years and my peers
So my voice over the snares is the only way they hear
What I got behind my membrane, but I've been smoking chem strains
So lately I've been having hard times with remembering
But be patient, my studies prove Egyptians ain't shit
Cause I believe that we could be like Neo in "The Matrix"
But fuck it, I'm erratic, momma lock me in the attic please
Til I draw enough static in my somatic anatomy
And come out imputed with fusions of "Blueprints" and "Illmatics"
I’ve been going raw, this just how I feel rappin'
We gave y'all sur' tactics, so y'all can’t even gas us
We taught you how to be prepared but still attacking the masses
Y'all better get y'all caskets cause we ‘bout to annihilate
(The new Babylon era) My empire gate’s in the Empire State
I’m on the higher platform, look at the way they clap for ‘em
Never fuck with phony men cause I don’t like my back torn
Nigga ask Kwon, this that top ramen' you ain’t used to
Keep it neutral to scruple and tell ‘em no beef like noodles!
Keep it neutral, just so you can scruple
I tell ‘em no beef like noodles

It’s world domination, nation, you’re tuned into my station
Always got a doobie and a motherfucking eighth lit
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain’t about to rise to the top with my fucking team

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow? Point 'em out bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic?
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow? Point 'em out bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic?
Yo yo yo
Microphone, microphone check
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus
My hazeus, my hazeus view?

You ain't running with the apes yet, apex at the Empire State neck
Hand no crown, my niggas take that
In this state of mind, gotta state facts, suspect nigga
Get your wig pushed back tonight, to 1999
Who'd've thought that 19 I might be in my prime?
Thought of the right scheme, everything else align
Here's a penny for your thoughts, another one, another one
Eventually the dream was bought
Now that's a real, real, real mind fuck
Might fuck up your mind if you're lighting up
Make sure the ting is tight enough
If you tough, I'm a titan, like Zeus I enlighten them
Kick flows 'til it's kung-fu fighting them
Is it him, it is you who was nice as him?
I don't see nobody, no, no
I don't see nobody, no, no

And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?

You rap niggas ain't safe yet, hah
I keep the bombs in my basement
When I detonate, you can feel the vibrations
I got your mind shaking, am I right?
My light gon' spark for generations
One day my voice will be heard on every radio station
Cause fake to real ratio changing and it's
Everyday living in this life I see
That in every way they wanna see my life decease
But I survive the question is for how long
Since my homie died, I been trying to hold on
The happy days of my life is now all gone
But I cope with that weed I smoke and writing these songs
But it's should I stay should I go? Oh!
Should I stay should I go? Oh!
I don't know, I don't know
Lord please let me know

And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?

Every thing cool like in the state of mind
That this state of mine correct, cool, calm, collect
Deflect the corrupt with intellect
I talk too much, the jig is up, he has risen up
From a division of most kings
With their vision, positioned for precision
It's mind splitting and soul uplifting
But still feel so trapped in the solar system

And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?

Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
If I see you through my hazeus view
See you through my hazeus view
See you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus
My hazeus, my hazeus view
And I see you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus
My hazeus, my hazeus view
One time, what's the word
What's the word, what's the word
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo
Turn me up on the headphones
Two times, twist the herb
Twist the herb, twist the herb
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo

If looks could kill I let the swank drill like a deadly weapon
I drop bombs on an enemy at any second, uh
Look at me wrong I turn you to tombstone
Lock you in the crosshairs and you gone then I throw my deuce up
Sip sangritas with your señorita, like me gusta
See what that early morning cock will do up to your rooster
I bet my cockiness will boost her confidence
Then  you gon' wonder where your highness went

I bet she get low for a nigga like me
She get low for a nigga like me
Bet she get low for a nigga like me
Low for a nigga like me

So we burn the Mary Jane till the third degree
Some niggas biting flows yo, that's burglary
Same niggas acting like they never heard of me
A fuck nigga could get clocked, yo that's word to me

He get blown for a nigga like me
Get his head exposed for a nigga like me
Put him on the floor for a nigga like me

Yo, my mind boggles when time toggles
In the ocean of stars it's hard to find goggles, we twisted up
So we put it in the air, don't let the J's start unravelling
We getting blown like a javelin
She throw it back like she time traveling
Rocked the boat so well, she jumped out and started paddling
I'm screaming "Land, ho!" 'bout to hit for sure
I motorboat it slow then I ripped the flow
I'm pretty sure, like nice beaches that
Even at my weakest I still leave 'em speechless
How you like those peaches? Find me rotting the apple
'Bout to bump so plump, 'bout to lock in the grapple
Feeling like the highest man about to tackle
Facts like the tat under the cap of the Snapple
Cats get decapitated for acting a fool
Blacks get their ass sprayed just for making a move

We get high and say "Fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "Fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "Fuck the police"
Yo

Cause every time I make a move they be sweating me
They want another black man in penitentiary
It's even hard for that man standing next to me
Cause he could catch a bullet that was really meant for me
It's like every step bring me close to destiny
And every breath I get closer to the death of me
I'm just tryna carry out my own legacy
But the place I call home ain't letting me

Cause you can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG

Cause every corner I turn a nigga testing me
And every morning I mourn just for the less of me
Sometimes I ask the Lord why he be blessing me
And not my brothers whose souls now rest in peace

I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
Just pray there's hope for a nigga like me

I'm something like the chairman of the board, ranting
I feel invincible like McMannon
One of the last original emcees that's left standing on the planet
Strike like a meteor, do remedial damage, damn it
Cats can't stand it, get they ass handed and branded
By the lyrical New York City bandit
True Warrior like Rembrandt
Yo some cats claim they fly but really been landed
I really can't stand it, let me take a seat
This where Rosa Parks her bum now make some room for me
PE in your beeper, hun you can read it and weep
My old hoes call me now, leave a message after the beep
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I just wanna be, girl, I just wanna be
I just wanna be free

I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me
Compton to Bed-Stuy
Hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
Yeah, yeah
I said niggas pop shit all the time
Me I don't trip 'cause they know I'm never lyin'
Lookin' between the lines
Feel like Ali in his prime
As-Salaam-Alaikum, alaikum salaam
Peace to my Slimes, and peace to my Crips
Neighborhood police and they always on the shift
Protect my Bloods, look out for my cuz
When it's all said and done, we be the realest there was
Who else if just not us?
If you 'bout this revolution, please stand up
We ain't got no one to trust
Time is running up, feel the burn in my gut
And if you got the guts, scream, "Fuck Donald Trump"
We don't give a fuck, never had one to give
Never will forget, probably never will forgive
Uh, I guess that’s just how it is
And they still won't let the Black man live

Feel the energy surge through my veins when I flow
Mentally, I can never be controlled
No sympathy for foes, my enemies exposed
Will they remember me when I'm gone?
I say rockabye, rockabye, rockabye baby
Shotta boy, shotta boy, shotta go crazy
Me nuh play games, so please don't play me
Look at what they made me

I'm part of the reason they still Crippin' out in Brooklyn
Before I was an artist I would book 'em, mm
Push ya shit back while on them front line, nigga, ya lunch time
I'm by them stop sign, you love that wi-fi
On mamas for them dirty dollars, brains on collars
Park the car around the corner, I'll be there in a second
The murder weapon on me, fuck if this bitch start flamin'
The cops patrollin', get that punk ass American flag ceremony
Aww, damn am I going too far?
Give you some flavor to borrow
Bitch yeah it came with the car
It's off-white, leveled the hard
You ball, might come with a charge
Your kids don't know you no more
Your girl's draws stay on the floor
No phone call accepted in weeks
Your son picked up on your beef, real shit
From gettin' lynched in field into ownin' buildings
Getting millions, influencin' white children
And oddly we still ain't even
Still a small percentage of blacks that's eating
Same routines, the same dope fiends
Them nightmare dreams, forever murder season
Bad intentions to them picket fences
They gave us guns but won't hire us, nigga?
So we killin' senseless
Homies murked on the bus benches
Retaliation 'cause his mama cryin'
Kept it gangsta 'til I modify 'em
Rockabye, rockabye

Feel the energy surge through my veins when I flow
Mentally, I can never be controlled
No sympathy for foes, my enemies exposed
Will they remember me when I'm gone?
I say rockabye, rockabye, rockabye baby
Shotta boy, shotta boy, shotta go crazy
Me nuh play games, so please don't play me
Look at what they made me
Free Max B
Owww! (owww!)
Uh uh (uh uh)
Uh uh (uh uh)
Uh uh (uh uh)
It's like (it's like)

Sometimes I feel alienated
Because I'm not up in the stadium playing or on the radio sayin'
"Fuck 'em broads we don't love 'em we degradin' 'em!"
But always find my self back at the bacchanalian
Blood vessels poppin' out my craniums
Niggas askin' when the tape gon' drop but I got nothin' to say to them
Because I been slacking the skill, although my passion is real
I'm too caught up catching a feel when I should be cashin' a mil
It's something bout me being younger that affected my hunger
Got older in number, realized I can't count on these hundreds
To determine my elation
Pursuit of happiness I keep pacin', these motherfuckas racist
These ain't fair races, they just let the fear erase us
Adopted by the slums, son of guns this is how they raised us
Yo son we gotta raise up, don't let them just array us
'Til we raisins in the sun, so we gotta wake up

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent, Apex on the vertex, tonight we're serving serpents
Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent

Got a whole bunch of shit up on my plate now
Thinkin' like in the man garden it's a snake now
Cause I don't know who to believe or who to deceive
Got me thinkin' I sold my soul and ain't received a receipt
But I won't proceed to retreat, Jigga told me watch your throne seat
And now I sees it and in respect to B.I.G., I gotta Cease it
And I hope he see me cause these niggas don't want beef with my talents
They ain't fit for this green, they just caesar salad
You think because you avid they just gonna let you have it?
It's a lot to learn and that my nigga need to ask us
It's the axis of the earth at the birth, I found a new balance
And now I walk on water just like I knew balance
Just like a relative, marijuana sedatives
Got me thinkin' I should put a bomb right where the Senate is
Cause they corruptin' the youth, we ain't inductin' the truth
Lookin' at the president like yo it must be nothin' to you

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent, Apex on the vertex, tonight we're serving serpents
Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent

I passed the dutch to the left and it started to make sense
It's funny how I see it more straight when I'm bent
You've been warned on the risk, it takes to take to sit on top
Been on clock cause you could see that I been on watch
Shit don't stop, 'til you make the sacrifices
Trade in what's priceless to ices and devices
When the light switch, I shift like I'm typin'
Livin' in the era where Christ is the crisis
The lifeless in the trance actin like yo mans
Bitch niggas only know that transactions is the plans
But the mic is in my hands so I valor the booth
The blacker the berry is, the more sour the fruit
They ejectin' us to make us cowards to the power of truth
Became flowers from roots and now we just move in cahoots
I move from the stoop and put my foot right down on the asphalt
Every night I ask lord if this what I asked for

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent, Apex on the vertex, tonight we're serving serpents
Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent
Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent, Apex on the vertex, tonight we're serving serpents
Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent
("Go Brooklyn!")
Said, what it's like?
Joey Bad' and Chuck Strangers
Leave niggas endangered
It's the real, yo, what's the word word?
Pass the herbs—check

My man Dirty had the buddha just to put me in my right mind
I rhyme stoned, drop jewels and bright lines
Sight dimes wit' slight closed eyes, I'm slight sober
Ma, you ain't that girl at giving throat so bye
F it, I'm bipolar, took shorty to the backroom
Play charades, she actin like a vacuum
Showed her to the door before the afternoon
She fell hard on the floor, so you know that she'll be back soon
Fake MC's get their reps ruined
Young villain hop up on the track then the track doomed
Click-clack-boom, resurrecting boom-bap from the tombs
Raps dope like crack in cocoons
Back in this mood, back on the move
It's the motherfucking real, nigga chill act cool
Pay respect to the cat Drew
And I'm way too blessed to be throwing shots at you

Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the era

I'm tryna find my own lane, in this freeway of life
Just remember home boy there ain't no free way to life
My nigga it's gon cost you, try not to lose your soul
To the rims, hoes, and gold
Cause once the devil grab hold, that nigga ain't letting go
And I'm far from religious, I just know right and wrong
I know how to write these songs, I know how to light these bongs
I know how to rip thongs and I'm pretty good at beer pong
Nigga, I'm so crazy, nigga I'm loco
Gassed up like Sunoco, press the pedal through the floor
Bitch we out the door, vroom vroom, skurrt
Bitch love don't live here no more
Cause her weave look faker than her Louie bag
Weak chick I tried to bag, had the nerve to turn me down
Heard this song and turned around, now she want me to unzip her pants
But I'm gone, bitch missed her chance

Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the era
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the era

I got sick of class, started making classics
Now all I really do is get the grass lit and bust asses
I'm sure to blow like bust acid
Puff, assist like Maravich, a true Maverick
And I average above average on an average day
Doing bad shit bet you still can’t pass this
And his teacher still pass him
Though they adolescents be addin' rappin' sessions over addin' lessons
Like fuck trigonometry, I’m trying to multiply monopolies
Subtract some homies then divide the cheese
Divide legs just to isosceles so my eyes can see through the E
Shit on you hypotheses
Hypocrisy after essence like apostrophes
You can’t stand here unless you pay a posture fee
Part the cheese, head out the spot and leave
A pile of G's for apology

Joey Bad and Chuck Strangers
Leaving niggas endangered
Danger, danger
Joey Bad leaving niggas endangered
Badman Ting

Uh, just put it in the air
Light that loud and watch disappear here
Thoughts at the speed of light years, I could see the light
Yeah, this the right year made the flow, yeah
Clear and easy to steer in the space and time erasing fine
Amazing in the maze of clichés
Each day weighs out enlightenment
Niggas blacked out 'cause I got ultra violent
Now my wave lengths to the radio waves
Still keep it under pavements but not a ratio change
My patio the same, but I ain't even got to tell them that
Poppy leave them dimes at my welcome mat
Get high as heavens, hope he'll never come back
I'm like 5'11, but have angelic contact
The devil jealous in fact, 'cause I rebel the spells
With a letter to God, I swear you know me so well
This one time, I said, "Lord, would you help?"
Some short time after, see my music on the shelf
And of course, I gotta thank myself
My wealth is in my happiness and mind
And not my pocket health in its ashes
If you don't even think sometimes
If its passion let relationships synchronize
Drowning inside her, true eyes is to the higher
I don't drink too much, I know the bud wiser
It's the livest one, Bedford-Stuyvesant

Yo dogs, I got the loud
Blow the smoke straight up to the cloud like
I sky high, my sky high
Ay, sky high, sky high
Yo dogs, I got the loud
Blow the smoke straight up to the cloud like
I sky high, my sky high
Ay, sky high, sky high

Uh, one hand on the mac, one hand on my sac
I'm thinking to myself, what if I handed it back?
But I gotta hand it to myself, I’m handling rap
Handsome versing that’s like hand-in-hand combat
Rehearsing, I got eight arms, nigga
Disarm your favorite rapper, he won’t come back
Made flex drop eight times, nigga
On contact, rewind that like eight times
Got to keep it G, this for my masons
Figure it out, eight times, the average amount
I may sign which I don’t like lime light but I’ll shine witcha
Bitch, I gotta eat, I might dine witcha
Yeah, I got bars but I’m like Akon witcha
Convict music for real, this industry give me chills
'Cause in the streets I’m chill but still heating up for a mill
I’m like so real, life is so surreal
Sosa really got sealed for the way he revealed
Taking hold of pitchforks still, but I will never yield
In this pitchfork hold thinking I gotta appeal
'Cause I'm thinking like a deal could get me living swell for real
But if I skyfall, thinking ideal

Yo dogs, I got the loud
Blow the smoke straight up to the cloud like
I sky high, my sky high
Ay, sky high, sky high
Yo dogs, I got the loud
Blow the smoke straight up to the cloud like
I sky high, my sky high
Ay, sky high, sky high

Selling LPs and CDs
Grassroots with grassroots, seeds on 
Five finger discount weed leaves,
Exceptionally speaking determination
Breeds success and proceeds,
Feds want the photos and IDs
Into them blood like IVs
Cause every youth
Want the newest Nikes
Straight jeans and white tees
But these things will get pricey

And I'm gone, hitting knowledge
And I'm hitting the strong
I've been hurting way too long
And I can't wait too long
And I'm gone, hitting knowledge
As I'm hitting the strong,
I've been hurting way too long
I can't wait too long
I've been hurting way too long
I can't wait too long
Yeah, momma I just booked a first class ticket
To my destiny by the way, yeah

Maybe I'mma fly away
Maybe I'mma fly away, some day

Yeah, so gullible just like my first love
Stay humble, but I knew that I was first up
Picked up the pen, and that's when I drew my first blood
Spill my heart again, cause the pain'll never end
Happiness is temporary, always has been
I just lost one, but sometimes I win
I always spread love, but sometimes I sin
I only trust some, that’s why I keep a few friends
Funny cause I used to see my circle never end
Always kept like 47 friends in my circumference
All that’s left now is the radius
They still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere
Things get severe for everybody, everywhere
This is my moment of truth, right here
Swear I ain’t scared of no man, I see the omens
I pick 'em up and keep it rollin'
The omnipresence is omnipotent
But I keep going, 'til it’s all said and done
I show all my soul purpose but I’m pretty sure there's one
There’s a reason why I’ve come, new season's just begun
This the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son

So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

I had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone
And read here lies a G followed by a poem
I couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own
Funny that I write most when I know my feeling's wrong
Went with both shoulders that my head is always on
I charged through harm's way, carry boulders on my arm
I feel strong as I walk through the many storms that
Rain on my parade, seen the dust cry for days
I'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today
My name ring bells all the way to heaven's gates
Though STEEZy told about me, yo I know he always watching
I guess there really is a heaven for us hip hoppers
I really miss my partner
But I know he with Big Poppa, 2Pacs and the Big L rolled proper
And that's a big pun, know that I'mma join him
When my time come, but the story just begun

So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

One day I'mma fly away
One day I'mma fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)

Let's just go...
My clouds gray, I hope my pain don’t show
Looking in the sky I wonder where them rainbows go
They say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold’s will show
Even skating down the block don’t feel the same no more
If I ain’t looking, I still see it all
My vision’s jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls
They stay scheming, y’all like the sheep to the shepherd
The trees to the leaves, you need but not needed
So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping
I'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating
I’m not eatin’, not blamin’, I’m just sayin’
Go to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking
They too fake
No rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break
Break a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank
Break a hundred, that's fifty-fifty as long as Rawle eatin' wit me
Seen different cities, different titties, all with no money with me
I'm on my grind man, no regrets when I die man
'Til we fly man, 'til we fly man, 'til we fly man
You gon' miss us when we fly man

So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

One day I'mma fly away
One day I'mma fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
From the block to the top, Buddha baggies in the sock
Only thing that changed now is we ain't runnin' out of stock
Used to beg mom dukes for lunch money
Honeys used to run from me when pockets was dust bunnies
Now what's funny is we done came up and conquered
Even the future lookin' bonkers from Compton to Yonkers
Though them gangstas grill, I tell 'em keep that drama away
Don't fuck with thieves, I like Jay so who sponsorin' the tape
They launchin' out strays, I'm tryin' not to get sprayed
Whether a spitter or a quitter behind the trigger, approaching his prey
His eyes bigger, won't stop to consider
What's right or wrong, because it's hard liquor that's inside his liver

But that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you could think you're cool with your nice things
But get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam
But that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you could think you're cool with your nice things
But get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam

Traded in my Nikes for a new mic
I guess it's safe to say he sold soul for his new life
Like they were tryna blind us, but we know the true designer
They didn't wanna see us find the diviners
So now we hit the vines up day and night
On the regular, I know my momma prayin' like
She want me reach my aims in life, but just stay in sight
So I'm shootin' for my dreams, hit the booth and it boost my esteem
The Pro Era crew recruitin' in them fiends by the boat load
Nigga caught a wave and now he surfin' coastal
They don't feel the name but they say the music dope though
Fuck it, that's how it's supposed to go, these bloggers too emotional
They'll be postin' you until labels start interscopin' you
By then, it's wild late and I'll be chillin' where I lay
Cause I'd rather see the top than to be livin' where I lay
Imbalances in my Kundalini, they tryna put two through my beanie
Wish you well, tryin' to poof a genie

But that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you could think you're cool with your nice things
But get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam
But that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you could think you're cool with your nice things
But get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam
But that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you could think you're cool with your nice things
But get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam
But that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you could think you're cool with your nice things
But get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam
Yeah, uh
Yeah
Yeah, uh
Yeah

This is legendary
Always been my mission, never secondary
Gettin' better every January, it's very scary
They gon' recognize eventually, I take it if they don't give it to me
Swear all of it was written for me (yep, yep)
By a higher conscious spiritually (up, up)
Up and away, jump on a plane, get on my wave right now
I want you believe not only in me, but have some faith in yourself
I wish you peace and good health, happiness and some wealth
I threw a coin in the well, 'cause I was feelin' so well
A token of how I felt, never heard if it fell
Not a noise, not a sound, still no reason to doubt
Quality what I sell, quantity in the sales
Quantum physics myself, count a million atoms of cells
This life I'm livin' it out, damn right, my vision is now
Don't let the prisoner cell build a strut to break out
My brothers at the brick house, the undercovers stakeout
Can't you see it's a trap? The type of shit I think 'bout
I sensed they needed my help, that's why I had to reach out
What you think I do it for? My brothers under a spell
It's clear we livin' in hell, the life of a black male
Right out the womb, you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail
Just waitin' for you to fail, a special room in the jail
With your name, a number on it so you property now
I see it properly now, it's what the poverty 'bout
It's all a game of Monopoly, tryna cop me a house
An elephant in the room until I fit in my tomb
And introduced to my doom, they say the end comin' soon

Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in the sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in the sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light

Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

Look, ready for whatever comes
I hope for the best, I taste the peace and pray it never leave my tongue
But yet, before long, the feelings done
Perhaps I was foolish, just like the boy that prays to only see the sun
Maybe, life happens like tides
One minute you're low and feelin' shallow, then all of a sudden you rise
Just, ride the wave, I say to myself
Find a way, the weight of my wealth
It's honestly a lot to bear
I play the game of stackin' knowin' that I ought to share
How much does a man need? How much can he hoard before his greed?
How can a rich father teach humbleness to his seed?
Just questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons
I look at all I got like, "What's missin'?"
God is my only guess, 'cause yes, faith relieve the stress
I find peace again when I find Him and see I'm blessed
Real blessed, life has always got me wonderin'
(Wondering, wondering) Am I doin' it right?
Am I hurtin' myself?
Am I wrongin' the ones that love me the most?
What a burden to have
That ain't no way to live
Or maybe it is
Well, maybe it is

Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light

This is legendary, it's never secondary
I'm getting better every January
The idea of it alone is very scary
I kill my enemies by any means necessary
I said, this is legendary, it's never secondary
Getting better every January
The idea of it alone is very scary
I kill my enemies by any means necessary
Ayo I don't really cry, ask why
Cause inside, no one ever really dies
Your presence is still alive
Your voice I still hear it
I still feel your spirit in a room feel heavenly with the scent of ya
We wasn't on the issues but couldn't help but notice your views
So many aspects of truth
In fact you let the past get to you
So thoughts on a better future, it couldn't suit you alone
We was stoned, by the snakes of this life of sin
But you taught me a life lesson, the fight within
Use the power of our minds, I was confused at some hour in time
My eyes were dark brown but blind
But, now I see even the sun shines through blinds
And now I move enlighten in sightings that I find
Enticin' in my prime, like, look at me now
You used to tell me read books, niggas bookin' me now
But how, could I have done it without you though
You was the big bro I never ever had you know?
Why you had to go? It hurt me inside
I feel guilty walking around outside with false pride
If only we could vibe like, one more time
Hear one more line or share one more rhyme
Even show me one more sign of destiny itself would be fine
But there's no turning back the, hands of time
Or delayin' the plans of your mastermind
So I hope you came across of what you had to find
And watch over the ones you once loved
You was my nigga when push came to shove

One love x4
The sky's the limit
That's what they told the fuckin' fool
I disguised the limit
Now I'm aiming for the sun and moon x2
Long Live Steelo
Yo y-yo
Y-yo yo yo
93 'til infinity, King Capital
May your soul Rest in Peace
Tell my momma I'm a shaman rhymin'
Jesus Christ and Shawn Carter are my only idols
No, Jesus Christ and Shawn Carter are my only rivals
I'm the Messiah of rap, my catalog's the Bible
To the new generation of lost souls
Student loans, iPhones, reality TV shows
It shows a host of wise, but blind drones
Post Babylonia, so I'm told
It could be bologna, so I don't hold it to be fact
Just tryna put the pieces together, puzzled by this madness
If that dollar crashes, niggas gone panic, what we gon' do?
How we gon eat? Don't even know how to grow fruit Detached from your roots, nigga, me too
I'm doing drugs, fornicating and eating fast food
But I know I got three eyes cause I'm looking past you

Enter the void
This for my hundred dollar billers to destroy
Spreading word of knowledge to through decoys
People realize that it's time to deploy
Stay on point: open your third eye, boy
(And keep your motherfucking Chakras open
Keep your motherfucking Chakras open
Keep your mouth shut and keep your motherfucking Chakras open
Keep your all seeing eye open)

Had to escape nest, told Moms I'm Apex
And plus I lay checks, I bust in the latex
So it's nothing stopping the kid if you get where I come from
Busting conundrums on nuns and condoms
Don't want no problems, It's the number one solver
Can't see me with these sentences, get your bars up
I'm close to the pen, I depend on this shit
Ain't tryna be dead bent, I'll ascend off this spliff
You can't pretend with this shit
See, I know what's real and what isn't
Ain't shit obscured with my vision, plus the herbs that I'm hittin'
Allow me to observe what is hidden
Could have been a cherry-pickin' nigga
If I ain't make jams and bury niggas
Used to be the sweetest 'til life handed me the lemons, nigga
Now everyday I see the sour patches
The flower of life devoured into ashes

Enter the void
This for my hundred dollar billers to destroy
Spreading word of knowledge to through decoys
People realize that it's time to deploy
Stay on point: open your third eye, boy
(And keep your motherfucking Chakras open
Keep your motherfucking Chakras open
Keep your mouth shut and keep your motherfucking Chakras open
Keep your all seeing eye open)
Killuminati all through your body
Like a 12 gauge shotty

And I'm still a beast with these flows
Feeling real low my tree self esteem roll
We drowning out Atlantis can't overflow beast coast
Be more specific next time you shoutin' loud a-mi-go
I am not the star? In fact I plan it all
Fuck what the media write, bitch this is a fire bar
Please don't leave your comment if you are not up to par
No names, putting you in a verse that's too far
You're mundane can't obtain, the knowledge in my brain
My set told me light you up so this that propane
It's Nathan all I gotta do is just spit a flame
No escaping, you in a swimming pool of champagne
You set yourself up for that one mane. The king of New York?
Ha! we ain't just gon' let that one hang
Last nigga got dethroned and you ain't from my zone
The rest of the real niggas is dead and gone

But fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun
I’m God’s Son, I’m Pac, Guru all in one
I'm what they predicted before I come
In fact I do it all for them
But fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun
I’m God’s Son, I’m Pac, Guru all in one
I'm what they predicted before I come
In fact I do it all for them

I'm getting a ugh, I'm getting a ugh from the weak shit
That I hear, no lyrical style come near me
How they gon' try to compare me to what's clearly
Barely, not nearly as rare as me
Swank make hands fold like a rare disease
"How thou art write this? Yo, it's scaring me!"
I got all these rap niggas fucking fearing me
Heard they was looking for war but ain't declaring me
I'm well aware, NY not Delaware
I'm the real king fella here, you more like Prince of Bel-Air
I'm clearing the air, might fire at will
These rap niggas don't want the static for real
Cuz they lines not adjacent to my spectacular skill
If you don't fuck with cinematic stand still
My life's a movie on the real, you can get shot with your hands on the wheel
With your pants at ya heels

But fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun
I’m God’s Son, I’m Pac, Guru all in one
I'm what they predicted before I come
In fact I do it all for them
But fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun
I’m God’s Son, I’m Pac, Guru all in one
I'm what they predicted before I come
In fact I do it all for them

Killuminati all through your body
Like a 12 gauge shotty

And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling like the, like the, like the
Killuminati, all through your, all through your, all through your

I love the competition
Go against the beast coast?
I retired that level of it
And now you have to deal with a brother like Joey
Which is a 45 magnum with a knife at the tip
And a shotgun at the end
Yeah... another love song gone wrong
Should've known you were a woo, like Based God in Wonton
But I didn't, and I ain't even tripping
Another foul ball but I'm still glad I hit it
Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know, the coulda shoulda type
Like "Oh, it was slight too tight, come on, I would've piped
But our schedules contradicted we're always tied down"
Ay pipe down, the first night ya boy layed the pipe down
Took off the night gown and, pulled out the slinky
She screamed "Joey spank me!", and after that she even thanked me
Swanky, one time for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows we be kicking rhymes 'til the end of time
But, back to the topic, oh yeah I'm pissed off
I'm still tripped off and wondering why my shorty dipped off
I ain't gonna front a nigga do miss her lip gloss
Now she sucks the next nigga dick off and my dick soft
So tell me what the fuck I'm 'posed to do?
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you
I sent them postcards so you know it's true
I promised that I wouldn't get emotional
And I'm not, so stop it
Why you front like you don't miss my whole cockpit down yo esophagus?
Screaming "Daddy, stop it", ripping out your tracks
Chipped nail polishing in the scratches on my back like
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky rolled?
And I tried to suck your titty hole for milk for my Cheerios
Did you forget about the video when you first came?
I hit that spot twice and since then, you haven't been the same
But now I heard you fucking with some new man
Can't remember his name but my first impression, "What a lame"
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with his shoulder stained
Faggot, six months, and I'm still at it
You'll probably never hear this track but I still wrapped it
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here
I swear I can't imagine you would not even care
Whole thing played out like magic and it’s kinda weird
It's like I did a trick and you won't reappear
It ain't fair, I need you back, sometimes I get scared
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears

Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player

I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eye
So I gotta to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eye
So I gotta to make the song cry, yeah
Yeah, make sure my shit sound tight

I never knew the world could be this mad
Only vision I had of sex was Color Me Badd
And I never knew the world could be this cold
Only time a nigga die, he was playing a role
But now niggas get their souls stole' so often
They only thing they offer dreamers is a wake and a coffin
From NY, to Compton, down to Austin
She said that orifice morph into abortions without precaution
Problem with our people, there's too many wannabe Jordan
Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune scorin'
Too many wannabe actors instead of achieving their masters
At least a bachelors but no, too many wannabe rappers, hah
That's just statistics, don't mistake me for hypocrites
Like niggas in the White House supplying Wite-Out
On Jim Crow laws, you probably missed it
Hard to be persistent when you're tryin' to fight for your existence

It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
Yo it ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis

Person mad nervous, you surrender to sterling
Look them in the eye, if looks made you die, you know you merk ‘em
Right there, plus his hide is like, right here
So you know that if you would fight fair then you'd have him like quite scared
But don't forget the TEC held high by your right ear
So listen loud and clear: you don't wanna lose your life, dear
And don’t you show a slight tear or let 'em sight fear
Just let em disappear in the night air, yeah, with yo Nike' Airs
Robbed by the crackheads left alone in the apartments
Mothers be jobless, so they make dollars shaking it topless, and
Daddy been gone said he, took off like ostrich
Since he gain knowledge, I’m keeping it with the synopsis, and
Shit like that make you wish you were adopted
To escape the pain, you join a gang and get intoxicated
Have no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary Jane
The only thing is you do it again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again

It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
Yo it ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis

It's a war out here, mad niggas is dyin'
You don't want that shit to be you, right? (Nah)
I know you gon' hold it down though, you know what I mean?
Just be careful, man, cause niggas out here ain't really worth it
You a ill nigga though, I like ya style, son

Imagine me fed up, a go-getter, for mo' cheddar
Po' never, blow Berettas ‘cause I, know no better
No Era, no STEEZ, no Kirk, no Lee
No school, no OG, no talent, no me
What if I just ain't act right?
What if I pack crack white with my sack tight, join the gat fight?
The click-clack type, slide in the vipe with the black stripe
And give my friends the back knife cause that's life, nigga

It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
Yo it ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices

My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm

The only lady I can ever match bonds with
On some atomic bond shit, our love is plutonic
But I just can't, put my foot on it
My one and my only, we not only lovers but homies
Whenever I'm lonely, right on time she arrives
She know the business for some minutes
I bury that kitty alive, oh no, I'm kidding but I really be in it
And we don't plan on having kiddies
But I really be skinnin', really be raw
They say sex is the weapon, love is really a war
And sometimes I feel threatened 'cause she really know all
My weaknesses, sometimes we fight, won't speak and shit
But we both know what the sequence is
It's like a never-ending cycle, something like your menstrual
The day you put your menopause, I'll pause the instrumentals
That's dussace got me in the mental
Me and you until the end of time 'til we no longer existential

Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions
Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions

My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm
My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm

They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
No, one man's clever, one knows no better
I like to go get her to keep her warm in cold weather
She blow below better then she goes for endeavors
Write our names on the clouds in bold letters
If hoes ever touch me, she load Berettas
But trust me, she's lusty it must be me rubbin' it off on her skin
I can't budge her, a pen? I swear that her love is just a sin
We back at it again, fussin' and fightin', I start cussin', she cryin'
Break up to make up, I start cuttin' then slide it in
Then mix the vibe with some Hen, you got five, I got ten
Now we some trippy niggas as high as a fin
But what's your game, love? Already know it
We some ordinary people but extraordinary poets
Get lost in the Moet when I po' it
Fuck it if we drownin' in pain, 'cause we don't really show it

Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions
Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions

My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm
My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm
You know, yeah
Always wanted to have super powers
You know, uh

This for my people, tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero, of my people, yeah?
This for my people
Tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero?

Uh, now all heroes don't wear capes
And all villains don’t get away
But all limits eventually fade
I don't wanna be good, nigga, I'm tryna be great
It’s hard when your back's against the wall
And if you got it all to keep your feet up on the floor
So I thank the Lord when I wake up in the morn'
'Cause to inform the world the very reason I was born
You can see the power when the mic is in my palm
When I storm across the room, hit the stage and perform
Word is bond, don't be alarmed
Don't let me have to sound the horn, and drop a bomb
Wanna get my mom a crib, with a lawn
Somethin' that my future kids, can run up on
So I always do my best to carry on
Life is like game of chess, don't be a pawn, my nigga

This for my people, tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero, of my people, yeah?
This for my people
Tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero?

Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it’s a plane
No, it's the young black god livin’ out his dreams
What you mean? I been up on an ultralight beam
They don't wanna see you fly, they just gonna shoot your wings
Everything ain't what it seem
Wishin' all these dirty cops, would come clean
Still swervin’ on these city blocks, for one thing
My man just copped a 30 shot, protect the team, know what I mean?
Music is a form of expression
I'ma use mine just to teach you a lesson
Rule one: this microphone's a weapon
I'm shootin' out the actions manifested and my passion
Never restin', I'm surpassin' the expectancy
Of life in my direction
Man the section 8 depressin'
Hard to be progressin' through recession and oppression
Not to mention that they had us cell blocked ever since an adolescent

This for my people, tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero, of my people, yeah?
This for my people
Tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero?

Oh, yeah
Oh, mm
Oh, yeah
Yo, what's the word word?
Pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Had to learn, had to learn (had to learn)
We just had to burn, check

It all started with this special herb, then after that, it came to sexual words
I'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse
She played Bonnie and I collide with a vibe when I'm inside her walls
I cut my shorties on the side cause I decide that she all
Mine's, I keep her in my eyes at all times
Not because I don't trust her I just, can't get enough of her
On the phone late until her mom dukes be cussing her
She played the hustler and I'm like mad customers
Man swear I'm in love and ain't afraid to admit it
Be blowing up her line, man I swear I'm addicted
But, it's all cool cause when in love, we all fools
They say men lie and women lay naked, that's all foolin'
Numbers don't matter after the first night
Right, so what the fuck is love at its first sight
If you ask me, another stupid analogy
Made to cover flaws in the female anatomy

But I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)
Don't front, don't front though (don't, don't, don't front)
I got some weed and some fronto (don't front)
And you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)
Check (don't, don't, don't front)

It's like a massacre when mass occur
I got a massive urge but I had to learn
Heard you had it on lock so I pass the word
I stash the herb, sit back observe
That she make me feel good is all I ask of her
In the clouds, who would've known we would've crash and burn?
I prayed long and hard, hoping things will last with her
I ain't mad at her, but I really wish that it ain't have to hurt
Let's be blunt, we're best buds
Both knew our role this is more than just a crush
I used to pick her up longing for our lips to touch
But now I rarely even see her
In everybody, hood not even the law enforcement can keep up
She ain't want no one to know, so I kept it on the low
Any time that we would kick it, I make sure I had some toe
I thought I knew her better than anyone would know
Bagged her at her friends, but home were I would take her
Didn't know that she was a ho, that only wanted my paper
Whenever I was with her, my mind would just relax
Could've been the hot topic cause I swore we were a match and
I admit it girl you fine as hell
Don't know your perfume but you exert the finest smells
You tryna find her then follow her trail
She left a few old lovers inside of a jail, that's all a part of the tale

But I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)
Don't front, don't front though (don't, don't, don't front)
I got some weed and some fronto (don't front)
And you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)
Check (don't, don't, don't front)

Ayo, don't tell me be patient with no doctor prescription
Emotionless positions and provocative visions
Should've known you missed a note like the octave was switching
Remember hate the game but she's spotting some glitches
It's a simulation yeah, stimulation
Take off your shirt, let me feel manipulative
My heart like the Himalayas, but yeah, I gotta slay her
I'm crushing on you sweetheart but yeah I'm a player
Sort of like Isaiah so baby let me coach you
And I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you
So, this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual
Nothing you ain't used to so my nothing is useable

We all try when you go bye, we all high
Truth is I'm never home and I'm cold if that's where the heart lies
So label me as heartless, it's not that I don't care
I just learned to use my heart less, gain sanity and lost stress
It put me in a state that just started taking a toll on me
Kept the secrets you told me, keep emotions I would hold beneath
Always kept the L so I know defeat
Said everything will feel much better soon as you know I leave
Not sure if it's the meds that made you think I'm mediocre
I was still body with a glove on, you know I'm cold, ma
I'm in animal pause, but you got an Ark
When it flooded, used to always feel like Noah

And I know I know her, had these kind of skills I had to show her
So I told her I'm the nigga she see on the posters
Came back through and I put it in the holster
Just had to teach her one time
Put it down, don't really give a fuck though (don't front)
And tell your bitch don't front though (don't front)
Don't front (front, front, front, front)
(Don't, don't, don't, don't front)
Com sol e chuva…
I was born runnin' with the baton
Now I'm known as the young intellectual don
Until I'm gone, where I'm from, the real don't get along
With the fake, look me in the face, eyes of the storm
You don't want none
No beef could never hurt me
I be on my Istanbul, they cold turkey
Firstly, it's the double entendre monster
Takin' haunted constant trips through your conscious
So be cautious
If it call for it, we leavin' corpses
The causes of the coffin is the broken clauses
Skeletons in my closet, tomorrow's never promised
Never mind it because we immortals regardless
Real G's move in silence like my designer
Intertwined with the timeless, divine higher powered
I was drippin' in the gold since a minor
Sittin' on my throne overlookin' my empire, uh, uh

Resurrection of real, you niggas fake
Never second-guessin' my kill, so choose your fate
'Cause I'm born runnin' with the baton, a tickin' time bomb
Nigga, better ring the alarm, uh
Resurrection of real, you niggas fake
Never second-guessin' my kill, so choose your fate
'Cause I'm born runnin' with the baton, a tickin' time bomb
Nigga, better ring the alarm, uh

So keep it spinnin', disc jocker
Flick the wrist, don't risk that, partner
These niggas impostors, we movin' like the mobsters
One false move, have 'em sleepin' with the lobsters, huh
So keep it spinnin', disc jocker
Flick the wrist, don't risk that, partner
These niggas impostors, we movin' like the mobsters
One false move, have 'em sleepin' with the...

It's the ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$
Who you mad at? They ain't have to ask that
Attack with the backlash, where's my cash at?
Runnin' all through NASDAQ, strap in my backpack
Goin' off the knack, dopeboy in the Cadilac
Havin' flashbacks, wish a nigga would clap back
Hit 'em with the blackjack, goin' through a stack fast
I snap with the raps, I make 'em bring the whole track back
Niggas get smacked with the realer
When I drop, it's all killer, no feelings
So you better not make a wrong move, nigga
I'll personally deliver each shot that won't miss ya
And when it hit ya, it's no warnin'
We bombardin', me and my squadron
If you want it, get your army
We droppin' bombs calmly
This is no party
Any scraps left, we just feed 'em to the zombies

Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren

Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in

Ring the alarm, we ain't keepin' it calm
Need a reason to see the dog, break the leash and I'm on
Was hungry when I started, more ravenous as I evolve
Caution hazardous, inflictin' damages, I can't recall, uh
Rich in spirit when I broke some laws
I'm breakin' even with my Pros against all the oddsMade my words cut deep, you gon' need some gauzeAnd that alcohol, we only goin' bar for bar
You know I blacked out, they bring the track out, I lay the smack down
Remember nights on the dirty mattress in the trap house?
I snap out 'em and flipped it around to where I'm at now
Livin' legend, finally back up on the map now
Resurrection of real, let's bring it back
It ain't even about the bars, they bumpin' whatever slaps now
All I hear is that ad-lib rappin' on my SoundCloud
Sick of the trash out, this is the crackdown

Likkle bwoy dun backshot we'll bury ya
Big metal ting ya get Captain Amerikkka
Beast coat regime (La Cosa Nostra)
My team supreme (Fuck around and smoke ya)
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in

It's been my jail since a day old, but they know
Yeah this ones for the ladies
Who be tryna have my baby

Ayo, word to my mother, two things I never do
Is leave the crib without some rubbers or tell a funky ho I love her
These broads be trying to get a brother caught up in a sticky situation
Missing menstruation cycles
They all psycho ask Michael
Before you give her dough for billie jeans and them nice clothes
Like whoa don't let them trap you on the tight rope
Spike holes in the condom to form a zygote
Overnight, ask Kwon, he know what it's like
He wore a hat but it exploded twice
But fuck a bad bitch I do this rap shit and put it over life
On the coldest nights son shine like a solar strike
And I swear I got the weirdest cases
Pipe chicks in the weirdest places from rooftops to staircases
Like get a load of their faces
Face it, if you fear, hate it, you get put into this clear space

I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'

'Bout to go nuts, niggas get their achoos to these cashews
Who you know that cool that they drip swagu?
And I’m here to stay like tattoos on statues
Check your mirror nigga, that’s the second time I passed you
Eating my gas fume, got me thinking like who gassed you
Your girl got gas too, she let me tackle for a dutch and a Snapple
And that's who you decide to put on shackles
I’m that dude, fuck values, pump up the volume
All up in the cut, no alcohol, just mad booze
Tryin to find a pad to bring her back to like a tadpole
I'm that folk, got bad chicks that I feel bad for
Losing to they back bones, looking at my cock tip
Down to do all all no matter what the synopsis is
All it takes is some exotic piff
They all unconscious, topless, exposing they crotch and shit

I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'

It's a movie scene when I enter
Better get your man if he sentimental
If you don't get the memo I'm sending metal
'Cause we ain't just letting off on instrumentals no mo'
We ain't just letting off on instrumentals no mo'

Lil' Spanish mami, young Mexicana
Fed her white lies, no Betty Blanca
Took one hit and it mesmerized her
Shorty tryna get me lined by the Federales
Dammit I love it when she talkin' sloppy
Give me toppy and call me papi
Whisper that freak shit all in my ear though
Me gusta mami, y yo quiero
That pussy make a nigga tip his sombrero though (Damn)
She ain't fuckin' niggas with no dinero no (Yeah)
That's my chica, señorita
Mi niña, yo necesito
Mira, mira, she muy bonita
I need to see her, I need to see her

Need the bad mamis, front and center
It's a movie scene when I enter
Better get your man if he sentimental
If I don't get the memo I'm sending metal
'Cause we ain't just letting off on instrumentals no more

Got this little bad Rican, she love the freakin'
Need to see me at least twice a weekend
What's the skin tone? Butter pecan
Made me drop my old hoes I don't need to see 'em
I don't even need 'em
¿Como estás, papi? Muy bien
I'll be on el avión while you prolly home
And you still fuck around with them maricóns
Young Gustavo, smoke Cubanos, out in Cabo with the next top model
Feelin' like a nigga just hit the lotto
I'm so up high, I'll be smoking on hydro
Plus she loyal, suck and swallow
After that it's arroz con pollo
Picture perfect don't take a photo
That pussy worth to make a fly solo

Need the bad mamis, front and center
It's a movie scene when I enter
Better get your man if he sentimental
If you don't get the memo I'm sending metal
'Cause, we ain't just letting off on instrumentals no more
We ain't just letting off on instrumentals no mo'

I need all my bad mamis, front and center
Shake that thing for me when I enter
Better get ya man if he sentimental
If you don't get the memo I'm sending metal
'Cause, we ain't just letting off on instrumentals no mo'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Soy el fuego que

Jozif Badmon
Representing
Peace to the world
Yeah yeah
Soy el fuego que...

What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my motherfuckin'...

Ready to bust my gun, I'm rushin' in like Vladimir Putin
What you want son? Fuck a rou-, let's get shootin'
The 47 Goonz recruitin', join or die
We comin' for groups of guys in suits and ties
Who choose to hide truth from the eye
Grab a white collar by his white evil eye
Fight or flight, yo, that's just what it is
When you see a pig, hit him in his baby back ribs
But don't trip, I'm just another black kid, caught up in the mix
Tryna make a dollar outta 47 cents
Yo, this shit is intense, a dumb cop stoppin' me, probably
Cause he's still livin' in the past tense, how shit was back then
They wanna see the downfall of all black men
And African, I was sent to put action in
But what's new when the po keep flashin' in?
News flash niggas, get a news flash

What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my motherfuckin'...

These niggas ain't ready for the war
Know what I'm 'bout, cut the cheddar, close your drawer
Please put your bread up
We ain't gon' settle for no iceberg lettuce
Let us eat when there's war
Or end up like venison meat in the street
They're not ready for beef
Let the fish burn in the pot, niggas all in the spot
When it turns 12 'o clock then, we'll be curvin' the block
Yo cut this shit
Man, I'm the best in the sector
Get your ear buds to grip, then I dissect ya
Inject ya with my lethal weapon
Plant a mine in the deepest section, guess who's least expected
Mothafucka please respect it
The last one to pull my card was easily dealt with
They felt it, the shift, records can't be reckoned with
On tracks wreckin' shit, ask me why I'm reckless
Break a wrist, approach my demo with a risk
Brought my demo listens, I'm a demolition specialist
I got the blueprint to this shit, Jay to the Oh Vee
If Blue was a prince, I'm still Joseph Kony
Niggas know they can't ever little bro me
No matter how big they blow, they still a little below
It's the P-R-O E-R-A, indigo with the killer flow
Guaranteed the realest that you ever saw

What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?

What's my motherfuckin'...

The Badmon, young kingpin
I move dope with that ink pen
Been up all night—my third eye ain't even blinkin'
Fuck what you thinkin'
Number 99, never trust no swine
Lick a shot one time
Yo yo
Badmon representin'
Yo yo

They say you never know what you got
'Til it's all up and away
And it's so lonely at the top
Sometimes you wanna throw it away
But lately I've been talking to God
He told me Heaven is a way better place
So I'm taking everything that I've got
And I'm running away, I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)
I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)

Gone like the wind, I can't seem to win
I know the end is near, but I just don't know when
Turn on to CNN, look at what I see again
It's another black man, died at the white hand of justice
To tell the truth, man, I'm fuckin' disgusted
I fear for the lives, for my sisters, my brothers
Less fortunate than I, let's formulate a plan
I'm sick of holdin' grudges, I'm loadin' in all my slugs and
Aimin' it at the judges, fuck the cops
Fuck the system and the government, you fuckers not
Protectin' and servin'
You more like damagin' and hurtin'
And letting off shots 'til you motherfuckers certain
He ain't breathin', you made it clear
"Fuck your breath, nigga," don't even deserve air
Don't even deserve shit, don't even deserve nothin'
If black lives really mattered, you niggas would do somethin'
Instead we mean nothin', in fact, we being hunted
They don't want us in abundance
They know it's strength in them numbers
That's why they gave you one
The time is comin', no discussion
If you ain't got a gun, then you better start runnin'

Run to the rock of my salvation (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Run to the stone that the builder rejected (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I run to aboriginal, Christ, Haile Selassie
Hear them call some other name
Them other guy nuh qualified
A long long time mi see ah idiot a try
Tell me America is the land of the free, that's a lie
'Cause nobody, nuh free 'bout yah
Bet how we leave Babylon, and go ah Ethiopia
And if you don't believe we can achieve that
Then you is just another idiot or another

Motherfucker, it's the J-O-Z-I-F B-A-D-M-O-N
Come on, bring them M's on in
I'm on the upside now, you can turn 'em M's upside down
We 'bout to win, there's an L for the other side of him
Most greats that you lost, I invite 'em in
To my soul, don't you feel the vibes when I'm channelin'?
The innermost of my spirit been engulfed with plenty gold
'Cause most of them labels throw pennies so
Who you think investin' in penitentiaries though?
Same owners as them labels, same owners of your cable
Spoon feedin' you fables, tryna keep your mind stable
Your eyes blind, and your skin's hazel
The truth is under your nasal but even the air's all fucked up
How we supposed to see stars? Chemical trails above us
Plus bunch of other shit that's undiscovered
Detached from the roots since we set sail, my brothers
That's word to motherland, sold us on stolen land
Visions from brother man, he seen us all holdin' hands
Fifty years later, still see my brothers choked to death
R.I.P. to Eric Garner, only right I show respect
Nowaday they hangin' us by a different tree
Branches of the government, I can name all three
Judicial, legislative and executive
Lock your pops away, your moms, then next the kids
It's all consecutive, I'm just tryna break the cycle
I wonder if I'll do it all before they take my life, yo
Crucify my image, the Lord is my witness
If them Heaven's gates closed
I'ma break all them hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all the hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all the hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all

They say you never know what you got
'Til it's all up and away
And it's so lonely at the top
Sometimes you wanna throw it away
But lately I've been talking to God
He told me Heaven is a way better place
So I'm taking everything that I've got
And I'm running away, I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)
I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)

As fast as I can to Mount Zion
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
Running away (I'm running away)
Away, running away

You better start running, running
Babylon boy them ah coming, coming yeah
You better start running, running
Babylon is coming
Babylon get jealous of we, of we
Just because I walk this way
Babylon get jealous of we, of we
We don't say swag no more, we say swank
Yo, yo, hip-hop's a jungle

Uh, lost in his time, I'm just tryna get it like a boss in his prime
These fake niggas sublime, light for fine sights
Wishing we'll fortune but the price ain't quite right
The slice ain't quite ripe
Still pulling strings how I fly but I don't like kites
How they gon' treat Brooklyn's finest not as fine as diamonds?
And fine nice, surrounded by hard flow like Icelands
Now we getting icing, finances nice
And I don't like surprises, I like superb prices rising
It's the least I could do, these verses priceless
Rehearse in private, reverse her eyelid until she curse in silent (insolent)
Got a problem solve it, all my Pros solids
We all gon' dine and until then we mobbing
So don't push me, uh, I'm close to the pussy
Even closer to the knowledge, dropped out of college in advance
Then hit the ground running like it's ants in my pants
Honey, Pop was a bumbaclot and had a queen bee Mommy
Uh, I love her to the tissue, disrespect my blood and it's an issue
She like, "This you on the cover for real? Ah, you so official"
Now go ahead and buy you some shoes that really fit you
I know she always think of little me, but now I got big literally
Worldwide and physically
I'm saying I used to take walks around Little Italy
Now I roam 'round Sicily and I'm plotting on a milli

Hmmm, another loud pack, another proud cat
Hey, pound that, hip-hop sounds been profound back
Slow down that metronome, nigga
Let it hit home when the specimen showin' gon' glitter
Gold and ices trigger, your true ideology
I can subtract one with the gun, that's true trigonometry
But that won't coincide with the true nigga that I'mma be
He's royal poverty, I kicks philosophies
Not because I rock soccer tees
I ain't gon' beg but I can please
Rock your socks and sockets out your knees
Fulfil your needs with similes non-similar
Spit that unfamiliar, put that on familia
If you love hip-hop, ladies, rub your papillas
And fellas beat they chest like they silverback gorillas
It's the new age, children of the crystal healers
Thinking I butterfly, I try catapult caterpillars

After years of constructing they start assumptions
So I keep my circumference of deep fried friends like dumplings
But fuck that, my nigga, we munching, we hungry
After years of constructing they start assumptions
So I keep my circumference of deep fried friends like dumplings
But fuck that, my nigga, we munching, we hungry
Swanking, Swanking, Swanking
I see you, Jigga! Hilary Swanking
Alright, I'm off this
This the song I wrote if I died;
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5
Beating the pussy like it ain't got 9 lives
And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, ‘cause you only live once
‘Cause you only live once (x3)

White girl wasted, my wife-girl hate it
‘Cause when I’m faded I just wanna
See her naked
Adjust adjacent, like baby let me see your matrix
Kama Sutra, back to basics
Since I was on the go, back to the block
105 on, started bumpin’ Hard Knock
I looked at my nigga Fly, as my heart dropped
Sedan in front swervin’ as the car stopped
In that split second, my foot steppin’ breakin’
I thought to myself, I always knew that I would make it
All it took was patience, and now I’m on the stations
Luckily I made it right before my life was taken
It was too good to be mistaken for happiness and riches
People callin’ my phone, like they happy that we did it
Little did they know I was ‘bout to meet my maker
Till an angel came down and told me that my time was later


Riiiiiight, fuck it
Pass the deuce, 'member creepin’ through the 'jects
Had to, stash the deuce in my 40 ‘Low boots
International, my bread is well earned
L's burn, smash hoes in Melboure
Light skinned jawn, look like Chanel Imon
One night, got her hooked, like I’m heroin
Vintage Vanson's  puffin’ on chron
Posted, lookin’ like a slim or Daron
Give me some to a 112 song
Smoke a nigga like a Newport Long
Pass off to my man, be a baton
‘Cause it ain’t no fun if the homies don’t get none
Right, it's like ballin' on a bitty
Bunch of bad bitches from different cities
Illest niggas in New yitty
Kush God, Joey Bada$$, relax and stack the skrilly, DZA


Late night cruisin', fusing the green with the cuban
So swift we moving through clouds intruding
Celestial Nubians, known them since
I was a Brand Nubian and they influenced him
And now it’s new beginnin’s, catch me sinnin’ in Sin City
Sittin’ and spinnin’ and spittin’ in ya city
Swimmin’ in ya bitty, put kin in her kitty and breasts
Got protection in the vest, but still penetrate correct
The vets, I got the remedy for these bitches
Inject, enter sex and eject get some intellect
And jet cuz all we do is flex on the weekends
They upset cause I learned how to flex on the weakest
End of my strength they drenched in they trenches
The fence in my terrace is gold, leave ya defenseless in the cold
And I know all you nigga’s weaknesses
Through my threshold, sight on some instinctive shit
Got the reggies from the Bush
Get lifted like a saint off the kush, man all my niggas push
So I always got the zipstock in the Ziplock
Stay lo, like Ralph lip stock, hit the Mary, won't kiss and tell
My lips locked but my grip's not so I pass it off
Real burners, and we ashing off your furniture
Fuck your couch, bitch, hush your mouth
She said she fell in one of them Ls, but lust don't count
These chickens don't love me, they love the account
But they will never know what's the amount, I keep the hoes in check
'Til they bounce, don't ever let a chick see you withdrawn
These niggas want to know what I draw with
But won't respond to what I've drawn
Tetrahedrons, take a dose of Patron
With knowledge juice and deuce Cubes of Metatron
They wouldn't hear the tone through a megaphone, let alone
Cella phone, but my line stay hella blown
Hella blown, hella blown

Yo Houston, we got a problem, copy
Four, five hotties in the lobby
Said that they can blow the rockets properly, but blow up spots and never stop
Like them aki's, they never get aqui to my property
Known around my city like George Pataki
Young Jason for them dollars in the mix like teriyaki
And round four, I force my large Versace
Over my big head, cause I don't live here, she getting too cocky
Won't spot me in no closet
I ain't like Kels and them
Her closet full of arm limbs and a skeleton

I spray nines on foes, bet if you pick five emcees
Seven, ain't gone flow like me, nigga I'm two-six
I mean too sick, sent to Earth just to shit
Mami, come steer, some new stick, got a man?, I don't give two shits
Better tell that doofus deuces before he catch a whipping
Hit him in his Charles Dickens and strip him for his Scottie Pippens
Cause it's all about the big pimping
Rob him for his Nixon, and then question him about his timing
Right here, it gets reckless, best advice is
To tuck your necklace, and put your arms right back into your Lexus
Cause G-Stone Crips, they ain't nothing
To flex with, and billy gang Pyru, they really on some next shit
So if I were you I would probably ride with two
No fool, not two dudes, two tools
As in deuce-deuce cause niggas jack you for your soul
And your new shoes and your jewels too
There's something about another nigga having shit
That have a nigga spazzing clips all up in your back and dip
Cause it's all about bagging the baddest chick
Stacking them chicks up in Saks Fifth
But word is bond, you been on
Word is bond, you been on
Yeah, uh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Watch me get gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Amerikkkan Idol, one hand on my bible, one hand on my rifle
I'm aimin' at my rival, sure to leave him dead on arrival
They say it's all about survival, never lackin' the vitals
So I came to kill the game and still gave it revival
I'm coming for the title, man it's best you throw in the towel
Last nigga who tried to vio, now facin' a trial
I'ma be here for a while, gettin' richie like Lionel
Now she all up in denial 'cause she gettin' the dial
While I'm only gettin' better, so she back on my D now
I wanna be down but she denounced
I got my shot, then made her, bounce
Now you tryna rebound, I'm livin' in the now
While the future figure me out
Told mommy pick a place, yo, and we out
'Cause Bed Stuy a little unsafe for me now
That's why I keep the .40 loaded with no safety around
Never thought I'd have to hold it, I'm just holdin' it down
Protect my neck and my crown, patrol throughout the town
And they judgin' just 'cause my skin color is brown
And for that, they wanna leave me dead in the ground
And have the nerve to blame it all on my background
Sorry white Amerikkka, but I'm about to black out
Got a message for the world and I won't back out
So turn the kid raps loud, I'm about to spazz out
Watch out, another nigga runnin' in the White House
But I won't stop 'til this whole shit painted in all black
And we on top, 'cause my people been paining before crack
Media's got this whole thing tainted, that's all fact
Feedin' you lies like this whole thing wasn't built on our backs
Assimilate our history then made it a mystery
Now they all inherit the bittersweet victory
Look at what they did to me, can I get a witness please?
Justice never served, reparations never sent to me
It's clear who the enemy, they declare war on the end of me
Assassinate my character, buryin' my entity
But they can't kill my energy, so when it's said and done
They forever gon' remember me
The fuck is you tellin' me?
Fuck is you tellin' me?
Way more than a celebrity
And fuck white supremacy, huh

I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Because I've never known a live one that represent me
Well, dead presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
Because I've never known a live one that represent me

It's no contest, can't fuck with the congress
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
It's no contest, can't fuck with the congress
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off

This that Bada$$-assination
Topic of conversation, my proclamation to the nation and its congregation
Been makin' observations like it's my occupation
Debatin' speculation like it ain't just second nature
Thou shall love thy neighbor, don't let that nigga hate you
'Cause he know where you lay up, when it's karma, time to pay up
Climb the ladder of success, I'm steady on my way though
Devisin' plans while you sleepin' I'm just tryna stay woke

You leave me no choice, I'm about to bring noise
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice
Yeah yeah yeah
I said leave me no choice, about to bring noise
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice

What the government is doin' amongst our people is downright evil
Disturbin', but not surprisin', that's for certain
With all of the conflict of propaganda, I believe they are simply tryna slander
Start a Civil War within the USA amongst black and white and those alike
They are simply pushin' us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it
They want us to rebel, so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails
Alton Sterlings are happenin' every day in this country and around the world
The scary part, boys and girls
Is most of these stories don't make it to the news and reach mass consciousness
It is for sure time that we as a people stand up for acknowledgement
And accomplishment of what we call human rights
It is time to rebel, better yet, raise hell
I just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it
Because this is all part of the government's plan and what they been plottin'
They're literally beggin' for this to happen, so they can kill us off
Usin' uprisin' and rebellion as the excuse in a timely fashion
The cancerous foods, the chemical warfare, economic sufferin' is not workin' fast enough
There are many steps ahead of us and manifestin' the future that they want
We have to work together, not only rattlin' them on a physical plane
But to outsmart them on an intellectual mental level the same
As black men, I think our gangs need to do a better job at protectin' us
The people, our communities and not assistin' in destroyin' them brutally
It's time to even the score
'Cause who do we call when the police break the law?
We are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another
But not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other
The code words to killin' a black man by police is, "He's got a gun"
Damned if he do, damned if he don't, damned if he runs
Or what about them? Them murderers got it
We need solutions, you better start plottin' now
It's always been clear that they don't value our lives
My people been sufferin' way too long
And I'm tired of singin' the same old song
People actin' like this shit isn't happenin', it's downright wrong
Justice won't be served by a hashtag, and that's the very reason I ask that
What are we to do? We're scattered around
With no clue of this ugly truth
All we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed
Time to wake the fuck up and do our own research
And not form opinions based on just what we've heard
Ameri-K-K-K-a is force feedin' you lies down your throats with a silver spoon
And eventually, we'll all be doomed
Real, real, real soon
Look, I love her curves but what's more preferred
Is the way she articulates words
Can't help observe and stare
When she in the mirror
Masking the massacre while she fixing her hair
I mean she so perfect
In her own little world
We built the foundation, everything I want in a girl
And it's a matter of time until her last name mine
You got potential baby, just imagine us combined
I wanna see you shine like the gem that you are
Want you be so secure that they can see from afar
That you don't need another man
And you can stand on your own
Let's keep stacking your bread
And one day we gonna get gone
And get, away from here
You're the only reason I be, staying here
Wanna paint a picture, let's make it clear
The future so bright baby, race you there

Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling

Girl you talk too much, need to relax
No stress please, just please roll us a fat
Blunt so we can smoke, and fill the room with love
You buzz 'cause I'm feeling the groove with this one
Come take you a sip, let's dance under the moon
They way that it's lit, got me feelin' the mood
To vibe and be tuned, I'm so into you
Let's lose track of the night and stay up til it's noon
Watch the sun rise and watch the moon fall
Let's leave a few wheels, surprised when you spawn
Back from the world of infinite beyond
Roll your eyes back and let's keep on going
Come take a ride, I'll be your chauffeur
I wanna make you sing to me as your toes curl
I love it when she doing all the things I showed her
I think our love formin' that's what I owe her

Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead
Low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead

And I guess we them little black beetles
This won’t attract the singles
And that flow is mean, but it lacks tacs and needles
I spend my days sharpening my skill wills while it's still legal
Reading through cathedrals applied to my cerebral
They ain't built they feeble, driven by the ego
The vision of a eagle, see the vision in my people
How many lives will they take today? We ain't equal
Another world war sequel and doomsday prequel
This ain't the world we thought it was when we was in pre-school
Sometimes it's hard to be cool, sometimes I feel like I'm see-thru
Sometimes I really wish, yo I wish that I could be you
Away from all the Hollywood acts and record contracts
I won't say I take it back, because I worked hard for that
But this life ain't turn out to be what it seem
Ever since I woke up I been living in a dream
Got me

Low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead
They got me low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead

Who would've thought a marchin' Martin could spark a starvin' artist
Spit art, at heart young Marcus Garvey
Ponders on it, hardly, rap wonders fondly
Smoking  herb with just Marley and me
This one is for my dogs barking up on the tree
Sometimes that wind blows eventually she gon leave
That's mother nature for ya, uh
Patient and sagacious
I ain't gon pay shit watch she ain't gon say shit
Now that's respectable cause most women expect the dough
Accept it though, words of the wise through them rhythm-wrecking professional, exceptional
Half man, half extraterrestrial
They got me

Low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead
They got me low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead
They got me low on self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching me, this love ain't proper B
Thinking I could be dead
Hello?
Yeah I hear you bro, I hear you
You got a minute?
Yeah I got a quick sec
Alright I want you to hear somethin'
I'mma play somethin' for you alright?
Alright, alright
Yo yo you hear it bro?
Yeah

Yeah
Alright listen, listen
Let me tell you what shit is like right now y'all

What's life like now, tryna figure out
They put this mic on trial cause he be killin' now
Forever bitin' my forbidden style
Been laying low for a minute in the game
Since I came all these niggas lookin' timid
My light could never dimith, the Lord is my shepherd
Jesus woke a devil in him since sinnin' with least effort
Thinking back to those lefferts days
And I ain't been the same since I left 6th grade
My mind strayed, used to have the biggest heart
Taking walks with abuela in the park, I used to tell her
I'ma grow propellers one day and be a good fella
Play the hero or whoever, the hood gon' tell us
Let's just pray it ain't the villain
Till then I be feeling some way
Thinkin' I can get the Maybach off gun play
Instead I let the words play with 90 beats a minute
Bet the streets lose a heart beat before the verse finish
But life goes on, basic rules still apply
Bet you can feel that line in any hood you live by
From Flatbush to Figg side, I was a schoolboy too
Hoppin' trains, I just missed my Q

And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know
And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know

And what's life like now, I can't figure out
They put my mans on trial, say he a killer now
Conspiracies, we gon' get you out
Just keep ya head up G, shit is wild
It's bugged out cause I know you tryna see your child
But I'mma hold you down still cause you my brother
I just gave Will a lil' somethin' for your baby mother
But don't stress, know you caught up in some b.s
Bet next time you see us, we gonna be our best
Love you my nigga, word is bond, you'll stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
Peace to all my brothers who keep still holdin' on
Been away so long, feel like a tickin' time bomb
The misjudgment of my kind, whom the odds is against
Put our backs on the fence, so we self defence
Followed by a series of unfortunate events
Looking like white America got a brother again

And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know
And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know

Take shots to the face with no peace of mind
Give me my piece of mind
Take shots to the face with no peace of mind
Give me my piece of mind
This life is all we know, this life is all we know

Man that's crazy yo, that's amazing B
Thank you bro
Word bro
That one is for you my nigga
Good lookin' bro, good lookin' man. That just boosted my adrenaline. It's been ages, I gotta get out this joint b. I love y'all man, real bro, for real man. I think by every day that go by, I just be thinkin' bout y'all for real. You, Kirk, everybody bro. I heard the new one on Rosenberg, that shit is a bomber b
Oh you heard that shit!
Finally got a piece of the profit
Wine and cheese in the seat by the cockpit
I ain't mean for your bitch to be watchin'
I am me, she kept eyein' me
Everyday we just makin' deep profits
Money long, I'm gonna need some deep pockets
Hands are to the ceiling when I'm in the building
How you make a living? Hmm
Lately never chillin', mind is on a million things I gotta do
Ladies want me, when there no time for chillin' no time for you
I've been on a different type of time
I never liked to rest, a different type of grind
I'm on South Beach like Tony Montan
Feelin' like the whole world is mine
And I sit back, let your mind run
No man knows when his time gone come
Every action, think about the outcome
'Cause I never outrun no bullet from a gun
Don't ask Malcolm, ask how come?
Ask any real nigga really 'bout some
When you in the field, nigga don't play dumb
Better keep your eyes peeled in the rearview
Know a couple niggas in the ville will kill you
Run up in your hands in the wheel and air you out
Never give a fuck, never hear you out
News clip poppin' up about you whereabouts
You don't really want the war so don't go there
Got my middle fingers up in my underwear
When I'm fuckin' the world on some G shit
With the waviest flow, make you seasick
Hope you can swim in the rhythm I'm deliverin'
She drown, I'm tellin' her to get a friend
White girls and they love me for my melanin
Kiss me all over my brown skin
I got the soul of a black king
It takes control when I'm rapping
Let the bitch unload like a MAC-10
Drrtt! Drrtt!—that's all I had prepared

Blast off, blast off
Blast off, blast off
Lift off, lift off, lift off
I'm 'bout to lift off
Lift off, L.A. Leakers lift off
Lift off, son, we 'bout to lift off

Hol' up! These rap niggas be actin' up
Talk mad shit, can't back it up
Don't let me catch you lackin'
I pack you inside the Maxima
Mark them days on the calendar
Don't you dare dodge this challenger
Sonics is hedge-hodgin'
Got heads boppin' way out in Africa
Radios be lackin' though
You can't front on talents so
I'ma kill like every show and any foe and any flow
No flex when I be in the zone
Know to watch when I come on
I check-in in the microphone
Collect this check then I'm headin' home
But it ain't always been like this
'Member when we was broke as shit
Savin' L's 'til next week
My ashtrays, I got a roach in it
I hit it until my finger tips
Get burnt at the filter tip
'Fore I learn to take a risk, I ain't even had a pot to piss in
Listen, I'm twistin' the system
The mission, the recognition
I see the future clearly: my premonitions is scary
Pray that they bury me
Where my soul has been heavenly sent
For the fathers and martyrs of this art that we formin'
We call it hip hop
Nigga, guess you musta forgot
And that’s all people wanna see truthfully
Don't stop it Pat, just keep it runnin'
(*various voices*)
And just ride with a nigga like
Just fly with a nigga like
Just vibe with a nigga like
Uh, uh, one-two
Show you what this do, yo

It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks
Clouds is they limits 'cause we in 'em
Eyes low, squinted, more L's but we winning
Acting like it's hard to find women when I'm in these hard-to-find linens
Remember those days it was hard to find a living
But now we got ends, and it's only the beginning
Big pimpin', fooling dimes, rob 'em for they innocence
Cake like Entenmann's, flow sweet like cinnamon
He a child but they treat him like a bigger man
'Cause when the pen in his hand, they big 'em up like he Jigga man
Know you see him in the mirror fam
The ones who say you ain't hot be your biggest fan like, "Nigga, damn"
Before he got popular, he been the man
With your chick in the cam, rolling through an Instagram
Got a whiff of grands, now everybody say they distant fam
Know the haters still jelly, but fuck it though; it's the jam
It's the fuckin' jam

Sorry I kept y'all waiting
1999, 'til forever
The era, no better
Nothing more, nothing less
Progress
(Fuck You!)
I stand on the corner of the block slinging amethyst rocks
Drinking 40s of mother earth’s private nectar stock
Dodging cops, cuz’ 50 be the 666 and I need a fix of that purple rain:
The type of shit that drives membranes insane
Oh yeah, I’m in the fast lane snorting candy yams
That free my body and soul and send me like Shazaam
Never question who I am, God knows, and I know God personally
In fact he lets me call him “me”

When did rap turn into a fashion show?
Too many makeup artists won't let their passion show
The anti-social mogul, havin' 20/20 visions
In needa bifocals, for your eyes dilated ojos
Open wide, never did I owe hoes
Suck a dick dilated, tell my old hoes
Hit my main bitch in the Poconos
I'm not Pinocchio, I never lied, I poke her nose
With the dopest dope, brand new Pablo, brand new God flow
It feel like, Escobar and Apollo
Swank apparel, I put a pic on the site ‘ya megabytes
Y'all niggas ticking me off like headlights
Get your head right, it all falls down
I bread right on the house
Eye was on 106 & Park and still on the couch like "bitch fuck Jacob"
I went to meet my maker, with 25 sacred stones
Told him save me a few acres

Yeah, cause' we just some Amethyst Rockstars
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Try aim at this Rock Star!
Time just keeps on falling, falling, falling

How is Hip-Hop dead? I'm still makin' a killin'
Banana clip peelin' and ho's I'm still stealin'
This is not for the soda pop niggas
Take me to the leader of the new school or the block dealas
Cause all these fakes mcs take from those figures
Is what get fake MC's infront of loose triggers
Can't knock the hustle though, I may just bust a jigga
And lookin' through my eyes, you can kinda get the picture
Mo money mo problems as you get notorious, inglorious, until you're a big Victorious, no show
Only way you get to see the kid is through a photo
Or  branded up logos, and the females come out at night
And when they find the pot a gold they strike, seducing me?
Wait y-y-yeah, you nice on the mic, yeah yeah, you lookin' right
Yeah, you just my type, yo
(Bitch, don't get me tight!)
Her friend split and dipped, damn I should've seen this
I'm in a boobie trap and thats some clever ass cleavage
Well, I think with my dick, I know you want to blow my mind for that reason
She said "You got clever speaking"
And after I'm done, I still got it leaking
I dipped off ‘cause knowledge a nigga is still seekin'
What you lookin' at son? I might rob you blind
Defined by every line, niggas tryin' to outshine
We’re both number one enemies, it’s sad though
One on one, and it takes two niggas to tango
Two niggas to tango
Watch me go Rambo

"Don’t Front on a nigga like me
Time just keeps on falling, falling, falling"

Yeah, cause' we just some Amethyst Rockstars
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Try aim at this Rock Star!
YO!YO!YO!YO! (8X)
It's all a hidden  history of mysteries
I see vividly, hysteria
Cause misery on the interior
As shit get more scarier, I'm never in fear
Just a little inferior in some areas
But I share, wisdom with Sumerians
Somewhere we in the place
Peace means harmony, not war and armory
But fuck that, cock your gun back
This survival of the fittest
Some cats get boxed in where they litter
These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like bees in the trap
Get smoked out and I ain't talkin' bout what you toke out
You choked out for really thinkin' that this shit is a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't actin' on the scene, niggas scream
The actions ain't screened, just well-schemed
I'm tryna' have wealth for my well-being
By eighteen, pockets healthy green
What the fuck is twelve beans?
I need the cake and cream
The stakes is high like feens off a dream jet streaming
Having cuisines with the best seasonings
Its the vets season
Carry a vest, you know the reason
I'm in Chi-raq and I'm getting blown like the breezes
The chicken strip teasers
Thighs, legs and the breast part is the cleavage
She even lick it down to the bone marrow
She in love but I ain't got a bow and arrow
I'm known to jack the booty like I'm Sparrow

They ain't tryna' see me in the battle
The lines is too narrow
They couldn't even outshine my shadow
They don't want the beef nigga,  let alone the cattle
They just wanna ride the saddle; so sad though

Black republican, black democrats
Black educator, black entertainer
Black, black businessman, black people Harambee
Save the children (scratched))

Okay, they sleeping on the crack, they overdose
Overdose on high fructose, royal toast till I’m overthrown
And over-slowed, I been speakin' over tones
Low but keep them L's high, legends live long
And we gon' be forever, this for the Era
They tried to tell us we too deep in the flow
The mo' the better, the mo' clever, et cetera, whatever
Why do they sweat us?
Dead us, they just met us, but they won't forget us
They don't know better than the worst case
I be headed for first place
Purchase they position cause they worship our position
But I too had no pot to piss in, and so spot on in this instant
And they still ain't got my decision, I won't stand under no man
Except my high supplier, he got the fire, I got the lighter
I hit the spliff and this what I'm spittin'
Like it's gas liquids that I'm drippin', pimpin'

Black republican, black democrats
Black educator, black entertainer
Black, black businessman, black people Harambee
Save the children (scratched))
Dangerous, dangerous
These niggas can't hang with us hang with us
Nigga we dangerous, dangerous
My nigga we

I swear all my life I been around crips and bloods
Grips and slugs, the trigger happiest thugs
Claiming the slums, and all the hoods that they from
Too much of the some, got it twisted up blinded in a rat race
Cash straight, the fake kill jake, the snakes too late
My eyes dilate, and I could tell them how he strafe
Coming at me sideways, get straighten up
Don't deflate it up gimmie the bucks my cash wrinkling up
Looking back in the days
Amazed 'cause the lab rat done made it out the maze
Still feel caged, enraged though
Used the underground railroad like a runaway slave
Broke off the chains still runway fresh
Got you on that mental plane with my project jet
I'm two steps above that nimbus cloud
My limit is low, when I'm smoking on that loud
Focus in the now, when the lotus is around
It's the Brooklyn sound, a pro found, Biggie would be proud about
But I don't need a vet to even shout me out
Punchlines pack a Pacquiao they can't box me out

Big up big up, it's a stick up stick up
Niggas hit a nigga quick if he hiccup hiccup
Big up big up, it's a stick up stick up
Niggas hit a nigga quick if he hiccup hiccup
Tell me what them know bout the Badmon named Jozif
Women come around, I look em down like they don't know shit
Word around the town is that they got the match explode it

I'm a child of the city
Son of the streets
And it's just a pity
They not tough like we
And things not look pretty
When we got to eat
Things get much deeper
Deeper and deeper

And I survive, thank the father
Feel like I was raised by Clans One Order
Had to keep calm and hold ma corner
Cause a stray gun shot if you cross the border
Pro Era teach them the pros and cons
Of living in a city with a thousand dons
A thousand ghetto youths with a thousand guns
Cold hearted killers with frozen lungs
But praise rastafari we wheel and come again
Know I Nyabinghi sit know we the drummer dem
Dem ammunition are tougher we power dem
Lightning and thunder a devour them
Pro Era teach them the pros and cons
Original Chronixx and Joe Badmon
No King Selassie, we have the golden crown
Get ready for the shift we are the chosen ones
I'm a child of the city, city, oooh

I'm a child of the city
Son of the streets
And it's just a pity
They not tough like we
And things not look pretty
When we got to eat
Things get much deeper, oh no
Deeper and deeper
The belly of the beast
I'm a child of the city, city, oooh city
Been get real ugly
I got to eat
Now every man has to stand on his own two feet
You have to love you have to dove tougher than a concrete
It's them to you a white sheet oh dear
These are the only child blues
The only child blues
The only child who? Yo yo yo

Back once again, hello it's yo' favorite mellow schizo
The pavement on this yellow brick road fuckin' up my mental
My mood just like the tempo
Heartbeat, that instrumental
I never lack potential, every track is essential
Every project is special, abundant and fundamental
Give a fuck about hundreds as long as it's for my mental
With wisdom from what I've been through
Knowledge that some can't get to
Understanding that college is only out for a nickel
We could all be so simple, tune it to the metronome
This how I used to feel back on the metro home
Fresh outta class I knew these days, they wouldn't last
Just a stepping stone I gotta pass, another story for the lap
But fuck it, give him glory when he crash
He gettin' revved up, heads up and he's coming fast
He paved the lane before the cash
They tryna swerve me out of that
But I don't just got speed, nigga, I handle my ass
Pedal to the gas, life is but a getaway dash
My mama stash guarded by my pen and pad
I'm drawin' weapons with the raps
You shoot, I shoot back no questions asked
Raise your hands for the realest cat alive
(Cat alive, cat alive, cat alive, cat alive..)

(That's that boy right there, that's Joey Bad'!)
The only child blues (Joey for the money man, yo Joey man!!)
The only child who? Yo (Yo Joey!!!)

And I remember sittin' in my room all alone
Staring at my ceiling fan, getting in my zone
Mama was never home
Woke up one morning, papa was gone
Young and lost so I ease my mind to popular songs
And of course I sold my mind to music
Writing everything I thought
Started openin' my mind, then I send it abroad
They don't know what my ascending has caused
My third eye been blinking since
Irv Gotti been inking murderous thoughts
At least that's how Irv gotta be thinking
If I'm takin' a loss and I'm better next week
And I'm never weaker
Never sinking on the fucking deep end
Any shit I missed I prolly peeped it

(Like you know, it's fast living)
These are the only child blues (It's not necessarily living)
The only child who?
(You can also speak on the facts that, hey, you're a teenager)
The only child blues
(How me and you, we go back and forth with it all the time)
(Like, you know) What, the only child blues
These are the only child who?
The only child blues

Yo, only child blues, OCB, OCB
Jo-Vaughn clean your room, OCD, OCD
I used to wanna be like ODB, ODB
Now I'm a rap star, OMG, OMG
Only child blues, OCB, OCB
Yo Jo-Vaughn clean your room, OCD, OCD
I used to wanna be like ODB, ODB
Now I'm a rap star, OMG, OMG, what

Everything is perception
Your perception of yourself or who you are is not what other people think that you are
So like for instance, you might say "I'm cool, I don't wear jewelry, I don't this, I don't that"
You don't have to, to, to,
First I wake up, wake up, thinking of a plan to get my cake up, cake up
Cause I can't pay the rent with school papers
I need two acres and more
I know how it feel walking out the door pockets out of dough
Out it doe, be on the flow
We smoking indo, but we out though, adios
My audio getting me that Audi dough or the range rov
Mahogany colored clothing, my hog in the road
Drive slow, cruising down memory lane before I hit the streets
Have my melody playing, creators choose flight with my melancholy saying
Head between clouds, I think I'm married to Jane
I remember the days when I'd forever complain
That's way before they started paying, I was in pain
Sick in the brain like I never met a physicist yet
Only lyricist on my metaphysics intellect

Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
Sweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
And time's not rewinding, yeah

Round two bout, half of this loud through
Don't let them hounds snoop and get soundproofed
High frequency sounds too
Has statik spot over serious statik shots
Scrap vinyls over them statik pops
Im a fanatic fly but a sporadic guy
Never chat a lot, just pass the Lye and guide the youth
Stand with the truth, Nigga nothin' less
When the playbutton pressed
Killswitches feel it hit ya chest
And meet your death, if im caught on the fence know hell hit ya
Yes true vets keeps it real whichya
Ill wit ya, show you the real picture
Only keep the ones around that suffer for meals whichya
Cuz when them suckas, see ya supper
And your cake getting richer and your pockets getting thicker
Thats when they want you to remember a nigga
But when I handed you the tape you couldn't remember to listen


Been on my grind, I keep it 50-50
Thats 100 on the real, no balance scales, still trippy
Where I live it's either you know talents well and sell records
Or no talent, well we still sell for the record
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the trap game
In fact is the exact same, and these tracks is my crack caine
And if you listening then you a fiend
Our music is the cure like some vaccines
Exotic to the core so stop asking
Got the blueprints to the game, but I read it as king
There's 47 ways to get this green
One is being an enslaved being, the other dreams
Red pill or blue bean, I can't sit still I'm too lean, nigga
Brush my bill on on new beams
Niggas on my tail now that I blew green


Sweet dreams stuck in the 90's nigga
Stuck in the 90's nigga
We just some stuck in the 90's niggas
You on that third eye shit, Huh?

It’s all illusions, fixed gear cruising
Fixed reality shrouded from governmental pollution
I ain’t a saint, the holy ghost up in my aura rebuked it
It’s the era of indigo and they go with the preaching
I ascend as the seasons, go on and I vanish
Cause I notice I’m slowly becoming way more imbalanced
A king with the crown, firm grip on the chalice
Solid gold angel coming back to burn down this Babylon
Has told many tales, his flows you could sells
Mastering wind elements, I move with the gales

‘Cause I’m a socialite in the night, bitch get right enable
I’m boxing yo dorm, Put my Nikes on the coffee table
My tongue’s below her navel, she makes it where her skills in naval
Seals my hands on her extremities, we’re chopping up these remedies
Came in between her and I
We leave it to the constellations like should we continue relations?
I think not cause all I do is smoke pot
And make beats, and yo ass just want back shots

Smoker’s club, Michael Jordan how I’m killing 4 quarters
You stashing the trash, hoarder
Yo girl starting to bath water, it’s Dirty
And that’s not an introduction, it’s nutching
Dirt on my shoulders, like Hova
My niggas turn boulders soft, that’s the shit that me and jovid saw uh
And now its like Pro Era in stores
All my niggas opening doors,
All my bitches is braless, flawless more or less
Balance was the key, more action less speaking
Everybody wants a piece
Peace
Check
(Peace)
Yo

When I release the flows I goes over yo dome far
The nigga to represent the barrio, we hold bars
I shine further, you sons get in the bogart
You gotta pick yo road, give it a go, keep the point, God
Better with the regis my mind, they manifesting
Beast coast, yea we the pros, you don’t wanna mess with
We leave you breathless, don’t second guess the best who blessed it
Less than yo adolescence when I speak my progression
Bring it down baby
Bring it down baby, uh

This is what I asked for, asked for
Chilling at my back door, back off, mind tweaking on bath salts
Confuse my intelligence, maybe I’m irrelevant
So eloquent, being riders with a elephant
The higher rank tryna pull a trump card
When I try and do the things, I deserve all respect
Intricit my amount, boy to any amount
To any account, probably I gets em out uh
I can see it through the pyramids
I can see it through the pyramids
I can see it through the pyramids
I must admit, I must admit

The mental state with a nigga that was penciled for great
Following schedules, never scheduled for break
But still embrace he'll put ya' neck in a brace
Regular days went to getting paid regular
Respecting the Era where the Era’s been ascending up
Got all types of fans that’s always sending us love
And ex girls that I loved I now offend with a glove
And stayed deeper but still heading above
‘Cause Mr. Hinds always gotta float to let the people know that nigga head is above
Regular sea height, cause they 3rd eye never seen height
Cause only this Brooklyn street light gave me shine to shine for these nights
Came with the free ice to bag bodies on the beat sipes
Bring it down baby
Bring it down baby, uh

Looking for who’s in charge, don’t be shocked, I’m the plug
Get inside like the socket, the surgeon, the sergeant
Energy – I put all in
I’m learning the flaw things
In the storm you stand out, you can struck and stand up
I know how to conduct, feelings electric
Well we’re connected, your buttons are pressing
Can test the reception, I sent you a message
Let me know if you get this, the question

Seen it all in the retrospect, took retro steps
Like it’s ’93 still, got ’93 til mic skills
Even got the ecko check
Like for real there no testing, my tribe is not some Tribe called Questions
My professions are not no seconds
To no veterans and they minutes of fame
I’m a menace, insane, minus the brain as I diminish the flame
Make it rain, champagne, 'til it falls down the drain
Got my head up in my dreams
Everything ain't what it be seemin'
Don’t blame me girl, blame my semen
You got good jeans so your inseams made seamless
And off top, you’re ingenious
We took a hit of of the greenest
Now she at most fear on the atmosphere but don't intervene us
Break her body down to the genus if she leaving
She didn’t get the pic and now I see Sophia
She get the tone, sorry Bonita but
Sophia got a applebum
Sophia got a applebum
I’m thinking I should take it home
What you saying?

*A Female says* Who do you think Bonita Applebum is?
I think Bonita Applebum is........
(Joey cuts her off with) "Hold on before you even talk, you ever been with a Bada$$ nigga?"
For all the thirsty sumchins out there
Beware
For like the 147th take

Cause when I hit it, that pussy closed for sure like she rock that V card again
She said “Joey no, don’t ever hit me hard again"
It’s funny cause I recall, hitting the score
Play calling, told her hit the floor and she started dribbling balls
My game foreign, way outta line - shit make you forfeit
The score like four-zip flow like faucets grip up on that pussy like a forcep
Aight, I done lost it
So make ya decisions, I’m seeing my visions of double women
But I play my position, in the cut like incisions
This is why I’m not hot, I’m sizzling
And it’s drizzling hoes, flows, and dough, so
Foes gonna oppose, roll stupid O’s
You get worn out in these clothes, plus groupie hoes
Love the nino sucio lingo
They be like “You rap? Oh bingo”
I be like “No Inglo”
I only know the language of DeNiro - I never lie
They never seen a Black boy fly as high past the slash in the sky
Got a gash in my eye, bleeding out
Cause, when it was seeing out, was worth more than the amount
Of all of the accounts, in this world I proceed to count
But it’s just mine and
I can’t find no adjustment time sweet pumpkin pie
So just get in sumchin fly
And you gon’ be my sumchin for the night
I’m in town for the day I say it’s only right
She was a fan so
She left her man right where he stand yo had mad plans for joe
I demanded a blow, whether her name be Wendy or she shy
I just want a little Becky this is not a lie

Wendy N Becky, Wendy N Becky
You so sexy but you can’t apex me
After you done licked my testes, don’t try to peck me
Please respect me, don’t test me
Wendy N Becky, Wendy N Becky
You so sexy but you can’t apex me
After you done licked my testes, don’t try to peck me
Please respect me, don’t test me

We used to smoke nickels inside of Nichols Park
I paid the piper, the pickle she used to pick apart
Peppermint sticks in the middle, brittle, a little hard
Cringe when she grin like the Grinch, that bitch had a little heart
Neck covered in diamonds and hickies
Every time I fly in her city, she buying a titty
Or selling a kidney, or trying to get me
To believe she’s having a kid and that the kid has a mustache and raps pretty
Emoji right back like damn she funny
Thanking God for the shows, that’s that plan B money
Thinking God my mom’s can’t be grandmummy
Thanking God he ain’t never make a plan B for me
Choke holdin my wine glass, rock bottomin' out
Rock, paper, switchblade, rap got him a house
Pops got him a car, bops got him a couch
Girl got him arrested, girl got him up out

Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself
Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself
Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself
Don’t even try to play yourself
I think you need to brace yourself

Slow down
Slow your roll
Cool your jets
Moving way too fast
Slow down
Slow your roll
You a bop
Going ass bitch
Skeezer ass bitch
Lying ass, tricking ass bitch
Bitch, bitch
Slow your roll, bitch!
 x2
When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do

Adapted to these new ways of living, getting money and sinning
Go together like denims diamonds and women
Tryna balance it at once but keep hitting these blunts
Demons of lust, keep hinting they stunts when I'm drunk
What if I jumped off this cloud full of thinking aloud
Into a, pool of my sorrow and start sinking in doubt
Rethinking it out, cause tomorrow ain't ever promising
And ever blink it counts for a prophet who see deposits
But he ain't always see the positives
He used to live in poverty, Thinking probably
One day, he strike the lottery
Cause dreaming big never been odd to me
And since a kid Ive been on a musical odyssey
I knew the day would come where I wouldn't be sorry in a pile of G's
Or probably be rehearsing a verse on the beach
Wait reverse in the speech
Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly


I turn my dreams to reality
So, I burn green same time I burn calories though
I'm eating now in fact, I'm feasting now
No more mistreating, my miss is treated now
No more misleading mister leader now,
Mister visa now, I got green and cards with no limits
Bad boy life but shyne with no diddy
But it's no biggie, I spread love the Brooklyn way
But when push come to shove I'm bout that Crooklyn wave
Shook for days, Don't ever judge a book by a page
That could be a cover up if you ain't looking that way
But what can I say, everything happens for a reason
Time will tell cause even fall lasts for a season
So keep on believing, you live and learn die and you teach
Another, piece of the pie and it's finally sweet
But reverse on the speech, cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly


Said we done came a long way 365 bong rips later
Last year I ain't make no paper
All I earned was some kicks some snares from some haters
And some favors from some chicks that move there rumps like shakers
But what's that shit, I was tryna be the greatest
Upgrade to the grade A list, but all they do is degrade us
And it ain't to hard to be famous, Whats hard is sustaining
Remaining the same when stuff changing
Cause I remember days at the bus station, waiting
Still had no patience, so niggas try to play him
Imaginary players, Imaginary playlist
I been your favorite before you even started playing it
Who'd of thought that they would come eye wouldn't be sorry
In a pile of g's, and rehearse a verse on the beach
But reverse on the speech
Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly
Break it

Like "Oh he's broke! I told you he was broke!
I told you he ain't got no money"
Or you know this and that or whatever whatever
Then you'll see some other people
You'll put that you're here in this house
"Oh Joey done made it! He bought a crib! He this, he that"
So it's all a story. It's a perception that people make  for you, along the way
So it's not really what it necessarily is at any point or given at time
And that's the thing that concerns me

Break it down
We break it down like (break it down)
Joey Bad', he break it down like
My nigga Fly, he break it down like
My nigga Statik, break it down like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2
Alright, alright, alright, alright, uhh

First things first is I been rehearsing these verses
In hopes that I hit the surface and keep myself afloat
But I know one day I'm earning me some platinum and some gold
And all them labels could just reimburse this dick in they throat
And tell my mama "Oh no," your purses will never run low
No more cause back when I was four, and we was poor
You would purchase the store
So here I go, your little man has got to grow
I'm walking out the door
My mama just be smiling cause she know
I got my back, ain't gotta worry
Only thing she ask is that I hurry
Home in time for Christmas for some dinner (some dinner)
"Seen you on TV again, boy you lookin' thinner
But you lookin' like a winner", aye

You got to give to get and then you give back
You got to give to get and then you give back
You got to give to get and then you give back
Then you give back, then you, then you give back

Worst thing worse, I could've been stealing your purse
Or just been, putting in work and leaving niggas in the dirt
But ever since birth I knew I would be something on this Earth
So now I spit that dope, that shit be hittin' ya nerve
And to my papa, my word is my bond
When you held me in your arms
Did you know along that a star was born?
Then you named me Jo-Vaughn, now that name ring alarms
Nearly 20 years later, we on a plane to The Palms
I gotcha back, ain't gotta worry (worry worry worry)
Only thing I ask is for some curry (curry c-c-curry)
Chicken when we land we eatin' dinner
Mama seen me on TV again lookin' thinner
But I'm lookin' like a winner, aye

You got to give to get and then you give back
You got to give to get and then you give back
You got to give to get and then you give back
Then you give back, then you, then you give back

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Break it down (my soul to take)
Break it down (I pray the Lord my soul to take)
(My soul to take)
Break it down (I pray the Lord my soul to take)
Break it down
Yeah, 120
What’s the word word word
Let's get it

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away

I could never forget them gloomy days
Although I regret where my time was placed
If I could go back, some things would be changed
And I would know that, for a fact, it was fame
That drew me to this unfamiliar side of my brain
That withdrew me from familiar and the closest remains
Although I'm gaining ends now, I'm losing friends
They say that time is money, and my time is well spent
Girlfriend hit me up to chill, but does this shit make sense?
And I don't expect for you to know if you ain't paying rent
I got to make this album, and hold it down for my camp
Surrounded us all like bonfire
When I lay a verse down that's more fire, I was born fire, uhh

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away

Went outside this morning, morning, uh
Seen the sky was falling, falling, yeah
Old man no longer snoring, snoring, ah
The rain just won't stop pouring, pouring, uh
What's heaven's capitol like, like, li-like?
Maybe I can crash tonight, night, night
Cause I'm trapped inside this hell, hell, hole
God, please answer your cell, cell, phone
I'm coming home tonight, can't touch no microphone tonight
Outside my comfort zone tonight
My brain's blown out my dome tonight
Tonight's the night, don't you try to put up a fight
Don't you trying looking for light
Cause I'm bout to take that flight

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away

Indigo father, meant to go farther
And travel across the water and pocket a million dollars
I am the spirit, I am the guava
You sippin' out of your coconut beverage in the Bahamas
Pardon me mother, pardon me father
I'm glad that you split apart it was part of my firestarter
Along with niggas, bitches, and ballers
And people that look down on me like they so taller
I go harder, I grow smarter
The flow's water, like Osama
Oughta gropple every dollar, every single piece of change
Move into the woods so I'll never ever change
Lose a couple friends but I'll never ever change
I probably miss some money but I never ever change
And they can say whatever but I never ever change
I feel I understood why the stars went insane
Ummmm brain battered from scattering every Saturday
Pitter patter with people that really matter
And I'mma fuck up regardless cause I'm a kid right?
That's why you can't spell summer without trouble
Stripper with no bubble, threesome with no double
Love without hate, life without pain
This without that, choice without thought
A dog with no day, a Seattle without rain

If it rains in Seattle
I'll saddle up and then you can ride with ya nigga
Fly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga
Vibe with me nigga, say vibe with me nigga
Say, if it rains in Seattle
I'll take you 'round the world on a Sunday
With me, one day, one day now
One day now, one day, one day
If it rains in Seattle
I'll saddle up and then you can ride with ya nigga
Fly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga
Vibe with me nigga, say vibe with me nigga
Say, if it rains in Seattle
I'll take you 'round the world on a Sunday
With me, one day, one day now
One day now, one day, one day
Yo, Badass don't act or pretend, back at it again
Hit it from the back, she a addict within
I got her on some shit like "I'm a get tatted for him"
She a ride or die, slim, when she in the denims
Remember it like it was yesterday
Another case of "I fucked your bitch, nigga" but a more clever way
Quarter in the room to elevate, said if you ever may
Slip then hit her on the hip where the Beretta stay
Catch me somersaulting my eyelids
Awakened from a dream, just perceived how I live
So it's make believe, rather unique
Lavish, sweet all live in a rapper physique
Hit up a show then after retreat back to the telly with freaks
Pack up a bowl and we ain't even eat
But we got a appetite for cookie creases and treats
And they all got tricks up they sleeve

I'm ashing on the bridge, Mary Jane, fuck your cigarettes
I'm laughing out loud, ask me if I'm still stressed, possessed
Hope the boys in blue don't arrest yours truly
Respect but suspect, protect your neck jewelry
47s and Uzis, well-connected and recruiting
I be with my Mexicans, I know they got the toolie
I'm smoking doobies with like 20 of my goons
Hotbox the whip and let smoke fill the room
Even through my lenses, my sense is on the moon
Dirty be the name and I came from the black lagoon
I'm sick with the ink like infected tattoos
Just one love but the two-three's branded on my shoes
You would think I had a eighth the way I'm crushing them grapes
Had her whining for a taste, that's why she's up in my face
Them Apex taking over like we running with Apes
What's the verdict? Nothing but a fucking disgrace, nigga

This ain't quiddtch but you know the snitch get caught
Then get bitched like the bitch she brought, throw your fit then walk
When they clip all of your Christmas thoughts
There's no giving when they take what you got
Placed in the crop circle, doc with a smock, see
Art what we drop, shopping cart with Da Vinci
Whimpering, leave that risk to your Pros
Wrist full of stone, lapidate if they pass me the smoke
I'm strapped and irate, daps from the fake
Get me mad and I contemplate irrational mode
Don't think about nada, strung you by your collar
The flow father who balanced out his chromosomes proper
I'm going home partner like Posada, they talk beef
But toss the ensalada, peep the blue Impala
There's arrogant cops who stay intruding
Can't stop the 47 like protagonist in Absolution
Them wack rappers who track-eluding
Critic is a random student who use the Era as a new rap influence
Faster than ransom shootings or some cancer fluid
I still kill and you can't lose it
After that day my nigga
I remember when he came back to school 3 weeks after
Gave that nigga a bible
And I was like "Yo wherever you go, take this shit with you
You feel me, and you gon' be good
Like I can't, cause you my friend and I can't protect niggas"
Like all I can tell niggas is sit n' pray and that's it
But niggas be taking their life for granted like
You know being on some wild cowboy shit, you can't
You got beef with some nigga like, don't be in their vicinity my nigga…
I feel it
Soul music

Sometimes I just sit and pray 
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Tell me what the fuck an angel does
We're seeing kids who ain't aged enough
Getting high off angel dust
From NY to Los Angeles
There ain't no love
In the heart of the city
Looking where they car be at
And they party at
Cardiac arrest can feel risky
Real pissy I chase cheese and real pussy yeah
Cats used to yawn on his rap now look at 'em
Shit ain't been the same since them niggas started booking 'em
Pull up with your pen up, looking sharper than a bulletin
With pin stripes and hollow tip bullets in it
He's something that you'd invest in
Catch him live on late night, but he ain't interestin'
Pop up and poop out something like intestine
No corrections cause the mic been checked in
The only time he be asking is when he sexing
My team like teenage mutants and X-men
Fire spark when I step in
He the human torch
Inhaling fumes of all sorts of course
Steez taught me how to store it in my ball shorts
So when we stop by the D we never get caught
I say it again we face L's but never lost
Either be a warlord for 6 fees short
Each day in this living hell feel remorse
But he had a million dollar smile way before he flossed


Yo, I'm trying to Oprah win-win with a "L" in my hand
Remotely passed off like the generous man
And they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand
But don't understand they the only one who gets the benefit, damn
Sometimes I just sit and pray
They couldn't walk this way in my J's
It wouldn't feel despair, but disarray
Like their souls disappear
Son got hot flows, got dropped like disarray
Couldn't close my ghost souls, eyes closed
Covered with Ray-Bans, I call it my eyes closed, and I know!
Even through shades of black
I see brighter days looking back in fact
So I relax my mind, see what these tracks can find
A gold mine that will make me rich in both dimes in mine
Gotta make it all mine if you don't mind
Cause sometimes


Right on the block where they sit and play
Lives the vicious ways where they spit and spray
Vicious trey's coming for the ice you kept in yesterday
It's nothing but the history
Protecting ya' from being history
And then the next day your face is just a mystery
For niggas who really ain't feeling me are all my fucking enemies
Even the lightest hours requires heavy artillery
Accelerate without the breaks of a break
And still I'm not eating up to now and there's a lot on my plate
All in a day's work of God and his grace
You wanna eat then tell God and say grace
And avoid the heat getting the boil to surface
A soft nigga caught between these rocks and a hard place
Because the Mafia is on the look out for the Scarface
But the ill-minded child, is ill minded child
Got a round of styles
Killing niggas' mental like a round of shells
Very well rounded, round it well 'til the highest number
Praying that 2047 ain't the highest number


Get off my cheeks let me do my thing
Interrupt the wave length
Live and let live
And people talk smart got the balls to say
They apex and standing for this way
But got nothing to show or give
I ain't judging
Yeah (wake up, wake up)
Free your mind (I said wake up)
Good morning Amerikkka
Good morning Amerikkka (I said wake up)
Good morning Amerikkka
Good morning Amerikkka

Now, what's freedom to you?
Let’s talk about it, take a minute, think it through
I'm all about it, but the concept seems new
The coppers still shoot us down on Channel 5 news
Lock us up for anythin' we do to pay dues
Some of us woke while some stay snoozed
Zombies walkin’ around trippin' over issues
The knowledge is official but it's often misused
America my masseuse, massagin' my back
Tryna act like, she ain't gonna do me like Pratt
Geronimo, take a leap and lay flat
I'm down to go for my message to spread across the map
Holy cross on my back got a bullseye on it
I gotta get stoned to fulfill my moment
Oppress my oppressor, suppress the opponent
Channel my ancestor, he wouldn't condone it
In search of the healin' component
Said you would notice
If you took notice, but you too nosey
Time to wake up
Won’t you come and smell the hot coffee?
Stick your nose in the wrong places, one day you’ll OD
I swear the whole world owe me
I'm nothin’ close to the old me
If you never knew me, then it's too late to be homies
Homie, say fuck what you told me
I'm ridin' out by my lonely
Waitin’ for the day the big homie take these chains off me

I came from
A dream
That the black man dreamed... long ago
I'm actually a present sent to you
By your ancestors
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Ayy
Oh, oh

Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

Why you can't recognize my stride?
Always gotta minimize my pride
Always gon' criticize my moods
I can't make one mistake, it's no room
Feelin' like I gotta leave real soon
I'ma say, "Namaste," and just bloom
But for now, let you run away from the truths
Since you can do anything you want to, anyway, uh
Know some things I ain't supposed to know
It's way deeper than just bein' emotional
Some things you just couldn't keep on the low
Now I'm free, by the truth, I can't be controlled, no more
Nothin' like I used to be back before
Know it must hurt for you to see me evolve
Why you gotta kick me down on all fours?
Why you can't stand to see me stand tall?
Tell me why we got a war?
Why we gotta fight? Why we always gotta spar for?
Why the cops always gotta get called?
Why you always tryna see me in trouble with the law?
I guess some things will never change
Locked in the cycle, tryna break the chains
Handcuffs so tight, nearly slit my veins
This what tough love feels like, feel my pain, uh

Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

Because Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
Because Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me

Okay, okay you red, white and blue
Now you no good Miss America
How you like this shit, huh?
I went over to her house on Sunday morning
Her moms had just gone to church...

Drive slow homie, drive slow
Drive slow homie, drive slow
Drive slow homie, drive slow
Shit, my eyes low
(Hey, what's up nigga *echo*)

It's only one way this can work out
Drop down, I'mma give you twenty if you scurred out
You scurred now, call me the drill sergeant
Charge in the apartment like a charger compartment
I'm in the walls now, I'm wired up
So now the higher up is trying to quiet us, uh
Smoking on land, lord I light it up
Just gettin fired up, now she coming like a fire truck
She threw the towel in, score for me oh for she
Cause she keep howlin' we showdown like Shaolin
Slow down for an hour then, sink it deep into the shallow end
How you like beef girl? Keep swallowing your food
I'm following your mood and it's blue and me too
But I can't lie like I blew this green on you
I blew it on the purple fume and I know I read your mind, right
You're bright, you want green of all types like limelight
Balance is the kiwi fused in the tunes
Third eye sight, she rodent the car with three blind mice
They chase cheese and don't think twice
And for that, some niggas in the cut get sliced
She looking back
Now, cause she ain't met a nigga as real in the back
Down as shack she throw it back for that, willingly
She hope I catch children
But the mag sheilding, in other words I wrap feelings

Yeah Joey that cat killin', villain
I capture the cat in the trap, a door she sealing
From sicilians to Miss Millins, to miss missin'
That cat killin', villain
I capture the cat in the trap, a door she sealing
From sicilians to Miss Millins, to miss missin'
 (x4)
I keep it lit till I'm burnt out
Could tell a chick bye look at how she turned out
